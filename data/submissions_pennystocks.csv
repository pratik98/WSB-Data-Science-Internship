DISCLAIMER: Before you read this and take all of what I say as professional advice, let me say this: I’m not a professional. I’m 18 years old and just recently got into penny stocks, but please take a brief minute to read this. 

I’ve recently written a Python script that screens all securities on the NYSE, Nasdaq, and AMEX everyday in search of stocks who can be potential candidates for a short squeeze. Recently, the one that I feel really has the greatest chance that appeared on my watchlist is $INSY.

It’s shorts have been experiencing a considerable amount of pain recently and if you take a look at a candlestick graph, you’ll see quite a familiar sight. It’s been on a consistent uptrend in terms of price and volume and has historically seen large jumps in price with this type of setup. 

You can obviously just ignore this post and chalk me up to be someone trying to pump a stock with decent volume, but I would suggest you take a look at it yourself and decide. I believe it’ll see a fair bit of action this week. 

Edit: Since $INSY is up more than 12% today, along with a few other stocks I was watching, I can post these types of updates on a daily basis if you guys like.";;$INSY Short Squeeze opportunity;

3 hours ago by PR Newswire
Companies Mentioned: NRGMF, GLNCY, WCTXF, FTSSF, KATFF
A handful of Canadian major and junior miners are ramping up operations to mine cobalt and lithium in 2018, betting on demand for a reliable source of the metal that is in high demand as a key component of electric cars all while battery makers seeking new sources of cobalt and lithium. One of the key trends seen in 2017 has been increasing EV sales forecasts, which have made the end game much clearer. Looking ahead to 2018, investors are wondering whether the electric car revolution will continue to have an impact on lithium, and more importantly, what to expect from the market going forward. In terms of prices, Andrew Barber, investor relations manager at Orocobre (TSX: ORL), said current lithium carbonate (LCE) pricing is running at around $12,000 to $14,000, while lithium hydroxide prices are $2,000 to $3,000 higher. He forecasts that this trend will ""remain firm"" going forward. With one eye on accelerating demand for electric vehicles, BMW AG said it is talking to suppliers of cobalt and other battery materials amid fears that stocks will run short and push already inflated prices higher. Today's active miners with current developments in the market include: LiCo Energy Metals Inc. (OTC: WCTXF) (TSX-V: LIC), Katanga Mining Limited (OTC: KATFF) (TSX: KAT), NRG Metals Inc. (OTC: NRGMF) (TSX-V: NGZ), Glencore plc (OTC: GLNCY) (LSE: GLEN), First Cobalt Corp. (OTC: FTSSF) (TSX-V: FCC).";;If anyone want a bit of reading. Take a look. New today.;

Ever since December of 2017 TEUM has been making big moves. They have cleared their debt that wasn't due until late 2018 and have signed multiple big contracts throughout December. They are a very active company, one of the only legit blockchain related stocks that I have seen.

It is setting up beautifully,  and I can see it surpassing $5/share sometime this week or next week. Expect some more PR(Press Releases) soon and hopefully you guys do well with it.

Blue Diamond Ventures Inc. to Pilot Cannabis Blockchain Application
Clean 1st LLC, to use IoT Sensors to Autonomously Track Sanitation &amp; Safety Compliance
January 3
th, 2017, Blue Diamond Ventures Inc. (OTC PK: BLDV) Denver, Colorado / Toronto
Blue Diamond Ventures Inc. (BLDV) acquired ZENO Controls and Verve Living Systems in September 2016 with
the goal of repurposing the ZENO Controls IoT Platform developed for Hospitality to the Cannabis Industry.
Dubbed the first “Guest Experience Interface” the ZENO Platform provided information to Hotel Operators,
that was previously restricted to engineers and maintenance.
Now Clean 1st, parent company of Cannabis Clean, and wholly owned subsidiary of BLDV, will allow the
data that is already being collected by Seed-to-Sale programs, to be combined with ZENO &amp; VERVE IoT
Sensor Data, to contribute to compliance by leveraging Smart Contracts in a Blockchain Application.
“The focus of this pilot” said Josh Alper CEO of BLDV, “is to test the system’s ability to track thousands of
tiny events that all contribute to producing safe cannabis products and a healthy workplace, the Pilot will
be built in Ethereum and have an ERC20 Compliant Token, we will test the use of Tokens as a method of
incentivizing employees to use data collectors and enter data blockchain systems. The idea of Smart Contracts
between employees and the operational process will investigated by the team.”
“This is not an ICO” continued Alper, “it is a collaboration between Equipment Manufacturers,
Cultivation Partners, Internet of Things developers and Supply Chain Partners to improve
communications between stakeholders, if we are successful we will have an application that can be used
in multiple vertical markets to enable Sanitation and Safety Compliance, then we talk about an ICO”
The pilot deployment will in Canada in the 2nd Quarter of 2018, an animated game version of the
program (think Sim City) will be released as a marketing tool within 2018, full deployment in 2019.

er111a;1515178798;7oddye;;12;;6;"TimefireVR Shifts Primary Corporate Focus Towards Strategic Investments in Blockchain Technology and Potential Related Acquisitions 

Jan 04, 2018 
OTC Disclosure &amp; News Service 

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Jan. 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TimefireVR, Inc. (OTCQB:TFVR) (the ""Company"") today announced shifting its primary corporate focus towards the strategic investments in crypto currency and potential acquisitions of blockchain technology businesses. As part of the shift in strategic direction, the Company has sold its virtual reality assets and appointed Mr. Jonathan Read to serve as Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Company. Mr. Read has been a director of the Company since August 18, 2017. Since July 14, 2017, Mr. Read has served as a member of the board of directors of BTCS Inc. (OTC Pink:BTCS), a blockchain technology focused company. 

“Blockchain technology and its application of crypto currencies is an amazing enabling technology paradigm that will have a profound and disruptive impact on a host of industries,” stated Jonathan Read, Chief Executive Officer of TimefireVR. “I am incredibly proud of our accomplishments in virtual reality; however, the Board of Directors made a strategic decision, in the best interest of our shareholders, to leverage my experience in blockchain technology where I serve as a member of the board of directors of BTCS Inc. (OTC Pink:BTCS), our strategic business vision and our ability to access the capital markets immediately.” 

The Company is already in discussions to evaluate specific opportunities involving blockchain technology, decentralized digital ledgers that record and enable secure peer-to-peer transactions without third party intermediaries secured by miners that use powerful computer networks to secure and verify every transaction. The Company has made initial investments in the space and is actively pursuing additional investments in crypto currency as well as one or more acquistions of blockchain technology companies. 

Initially, the Company will be focused on Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform for Decentralized Applications (“DApps”), which are applications that run on a peer-to-peer network of computers instead of on one single computer or server. DApps allow developers to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where the developer chooses its own rules for ownership, transaction formats and transition functions. Multiple types of DApps are now being created by others across multiple categories, including finance, governance, community, legal, health, education and gaming. 

Concurrent with this announcement, the Company announces the sale of its virtual reality assets, primarily the social media/education platform and virtual world known as “Hypatia” to a group of investors including its original founders, John Wise and Jeffrey Rassas. Consistent with this sale, the company expects to change its name following board of directors and shareholder approval. 

Mr. Read concluded, “We are extremely proud of the extraordinary products produced in our VR endeavors. We wish Mr. Rassas and his team great success and continued leadership in their field.” 

About TimefireVR Inc. 
TimefireVR Inc. is an Arizona based technology company now focused on strategic investments in blockchain technology solutions. Previously, the Company developed virtual reality content, tools, and services. ";;$TFVR newest crypto stock specifically Etherium;

Recently there was a relatively big talk about their comeback after being bought/invested in by some Chinese folks. They are supposed to operate under new management, with new road plan and overall different philosophy of the brand.

They are even anouncing new product line at CES2018.

wbcinvesting;1515374703;7ouzx7;;0;;4;"**Investment Overview:**
	From this report, you will find that CV Sciences Inc. has a high possibility of an increase in stock price because of the strong financial statements and huge growth opportunities within a growing industry.


**Company Profile:**
At CV Sciences, our mission to improve well‐being underscores our values, operations, and products. CV Sciences operates two distinct divisions: pharmaceuticals and consumer products. These divisions are supported by our medical and scientific advisory board, and state‐of‐the art production facilities. CV Sciences’ Pharmaceutical Division is developing synthetically‐formulated cannabidiol‐based medicine, pursuing the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for drugs with specific indications utilizing cannabidiol as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. CV Sciences has achieved promising preclinical results in the development of cannabinoid medicines for treatment of a range of medical conditions. CV Sciences’ Consumer Products Division delivers botanical‐based cannabidiol products that enhance quality of life. Currently distributed nationally in health food stores, health care provider’s offices and online, each consumer products brand is backed by a formal safety review, growing body of case reports, and physician’s recommendations.


**Financial Profile:**
	CV Sciences trades at $0.435 a share as of close on Friday, January 5th, 2018 with a $39,372,966 market cap. Currently, CV Sciences has 90,512,565 shares outstanding out of a total of 190,000,000 shares authorized. The Company trades under the OTCQB as the ticker symbol CVSI and has a daily average volume of 1,138,162 from the past 30 days. The float is rather low at 20,890,348 shares, but there is currently 21,400,000 shares that are restricted from a recent acquisition and, “Royalty Buy-Out.” After these shares are not restricted, CVSI’s volume and liquidity will increase. 
	These basic financials are the first characteristics I look at when I research any stock. People often forget about the importance of shares outstanding with micro and nano cap stocks. I always look for a company that has under 200 million shares outstanding, so the shares that I invest in can go farther. For example, while comparing two stocks both priced at $0.50 and one has 100 million outstanding shares and the other has 1 billion. It’s easier for a company to move to a $100 million market cap, than a $1 billion market cap. In this case, CVSI passes my initial review for outstanding shares and market cap. Also, the company has a high enough average trade volume for the liquidity of most investors. The last 52 weeks, CVSI had a $0.68 high and a $0.14 low, so the stock is currently trading below the 1 year highs.


**Financial Report:**
	According to the last 10-Q Report, issued on November 8th, 2017 for the quarter ending on September 30th, 2017, the Company currently has $20,410,496 of assets. Of those assets, $8,135,774 are Current Assets and $1,572,125 of Cash. The Total Liabilities only add up to be $5,133,069 and of that is $3,576,769 of Currently Liabilities. Breaking down the Current Liabilities, the two largest portions are the $1,053,794 Accounts Payable and an Iliad Note that totals $1,939,353 of secured and unsecured debt
	Comparing this 10-Q report to the 10-Q a year ago, the Total Assets and Current Assets have decreased by 20.8% and 48.6%. Also, the Current Liabilities has increased by 18.8%. This would mean the Current Ratio from September 30th, 2016 to September 30th, 2017 has decreased from 5.26 to 2.27. Over the past year, CVSI has taken control of their balance sheet by increasing debt to increase revenue over the year, which we will go over next.
	The nine-month revenue for September 30th, 2017 is $13,437,233 and a Gross Profit of $9,275,111, which is a 71.17% and 79.09% increase from the year past. The Company’s largest expense for the nine-month 2017 year is Research and Development, which is $11,513,560. Also, there was a one-time expense of $2,432,000 for a, “Royalty Buy-Out.” Overall, CV Sciences has a nine-month Net Loss of $5,366,946. This is an increase from the $5,660,755 Net Loss from the past year. These numbers are very promising because without the, “Royalty Buy-Out,” and being able to keep 100% of the revenues moving forward, the Company’s Net Loss will start to diminish and become positive.
	Going on to the Cash Flow statement, the nine-month Cash and Restricted Cash has increased by $1,264,842 to $2,322,310. The one number that stands out in the cash flow statement is the $750,000 increase in cash from borrowing. In the 2016 nine-month cash flow statement, the Company had borrowed $1,975,000. This shows that CV Sciences is able to run the company on less debt.
	Overall, CV Sciences has growth in revenue, uses debt better, and is financially strong to assure that the company can work another year on current financials. 


**Technical Analysis:**
	I’m not huge on the technical analysis of a company, but there are a few things I always look at. First, CVSI has an RSI of 53.28, so it has room to grow before it is overbought. Also, the Company has a 50-day moving average of $0.31, which is above the $0.29 200-day moving average. These two numbers show that CVSI has room to increase before it is overbought and the momentum to increase even more.


**Public Relations:**
November 14th, 2017- The Company was named on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500TM, which is an annual ranking of the fastest growing companies in the technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences, and energy tech sectors in North America. CV Sciences has seen revenues grow 403% from 2013 to 2016.

	
**Company Growth:**
	CV Sciences currently sells products through their PlusCBD Oil and Purified Liquid brands. The Company is also developing a CBD-based potentially FDA approved drug (CVSI-007) that is a chewing gum that contains nicotine and synthetic CBD to support the cessation of smokeless tobacco uses and addiction. The new drug is currently in preclinical stages. CVSI has 15 different conferences/trade shows scheduled for the 2018 year to promote and sell the CBD oil products. CV Sciences is currently selling their products in over 1,500 stores nationally. With more states starting to legalize medical and recreation marijuana and the multiple conferences and trade shows, I believe we will see continuing growth of sales for the Company.


**Company Concern:**
	On June 15th, 2017, the SEC alleges that the CEO of CV Sciences, Michael Mona Jr., made material representations/misleading omission of the CannaVEST (past name for CV Sciences) quarterly report filed for the first three quarters of 2013. This relates to their acquisition of PhytoSphere Systems, LLC in January of 2013. The Company came out with a report stating that they stand behind their CEO and the company reporting of this acquisition. Because this situation happened almost 5 years ago and CV Sciences is standing their ground against the SEC, it is not detrimental to the Company. 


**Investment Conclusion:**
	Because of CV Sciences Inc. high current ratio, growth of revenue and gross profit, low outstanding shares, low RSI, momentum, and being within a growing industry, I believe there is a huge opportunity of a price increase in the future

Rule 4. Don't aim for 20 % gains, only aim for the moon. That's why your here. 

Rule 4. Don't listen to anything on iHub. Learn the habits of users and look at correlations between the content posted and the result of a particular stock that day. It can be a great tool if used right.

Atypical for this sub in that it is slightly lower risk than some of the other stocks listed here (although it's still volatile) and is not meant to be a ""pump and dump"", but rather a bet on an industry that could see some growth. I'm looking to double my money with it as opposed to making a stratospheric gain. I'm putting a few hundred into it as an acorn in my modest portfolio.

CoffeeSailor;1515711887;7ps5f9;;6;;9;"NEWTON, Mass., Jan. 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Xcede Patch clinical trial dossier was submitted today to the Medical Ethical Review Committee (MREC) Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen (Netherlands), in anticipation of a first-in-human clinical trial. The clinical trial, which outlines the treatment of up to 30 patients undergoing various types of liver resection, will take place at two major liver surgery centers in The Netherlands. Subject to the MREC approvals, the Company anticipates that patients will be treated with the Xcede Patch in the Netherlands in early 2018. Xcede has contracted with their manufacturer Cook Biotech Inc. (CBI), to execute the study and make the appropriate regulatory and ethical committee submission on behalf of Xcede Technologies.

Today's news followed shortly after Xcede's announcement of completing their required ISO 10993-1 Testing Program. ""We are very excited to announce this clinical trial submission and significant milestone in the development of the Xcede Patch,"" said Linda Zuckerman, Ph.D., President and CEO of Xcede Technologies., Inc. ""We continue to execute on our development plan for the Patch.""

""An extensive amount of testing and data analysis was necessary to support this dossier, all of which was supervised by the CBI and Xcede teams. While lengthy, this process was thorough and very professionally done,"" said Peter Sulick, Dynasil's Chairman and CEO. ""We are encouraged by this step and look forward to the successful completion of the trials and eventual launch of the product, initially in Europe.""

Xcede is committed to the development and manufacturing of innovative hemostatic and sealant products for surgical application including severe, traumatic bleeding.  

Xcede Technologies, a subsidiary of Dynasil Corporation of America is based in Seattle, WA and began operations in October 2013 following a technology transfer from DBM.   ";;Dynasil (DYSL) Announces Submission of Xcede Technologies' Application for First-in-Human Clinical Trial;

TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE  Umbra Applied Technologies, Inc. (OTC:UATG)  Chairman is pleased to issue the following letter to shareholders today:

January 17, 2018

UATG Shareholders

Re: Umbra Applied Technologies Group, Inc. 
2018 Chairman’s Letter
(UATG:PK) Year 2018

Chairman's Letter

“UAT Group and its subsidiaries, operate with the understanding that what we do matters and as such our decisions bear consequences.”

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

First, I would like to wish everyone a prosperous New Year and I hope everyone enjoyed the holidays.

As the Chief Executive of a publicly traded company I am the fiduciary for all shareholders, many of whom have invested in UAT Group based on long-term goals such as retirement or to pay for a childs higher education.  As such, I advocate and otherwise direct corporate governance practices that are in keeping with long-term value creation for our shareholders and clients.  Last year I asked my executive team to help me outline a new strategic frame-work for long-term value creation that could be completed within the year.  I am pleased to report that we have been successful in our execution and were so against significant odds.

Over the course of the past 12 months, many of the assumptions on which our plans were based, including low interest rates on capital and an expectation for continued globalization, have failed to sustain despite indicators to the contrary.  With U.S. reflation, increasing rates, renewed growth, the increasing turbulence in Asia as a catalyst to geopolitical tensions, the prospective withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union reshaping Europe and the United States undergoing a fundamental reformation of long held fiscal strategies; the economic environment has been and remains quite volatile.  This does not mean that this company or the market at large is expected to be impacted negatively but it is a factor when crafting a long-term execution strategy.

The impact that globalization and the evolution of technology have had on employees and communities is significant.  While the overall benefits of globalization have been significant, I believe global companies represent a driving force for growth and prosperity for all. That said, there is an obvious inequity in the benefits shared.  This is in part due to asymmetrical wage growth but more specifically technology that has eliminated millions of jobs for lower-skilled workers while simultaneously creating new opportunities for highly educated positions.  Employees whose positions are being relegated to obsoletion due to technological advancements, like those found in manufacturing processes, are typically facing retirement with insufficient savings.  This is wide spread and is expanding, in part because at some point over the past twenty years, companies decided to transfer the burden of retirement planning to the employees.  This change in responsibility comes with significant consequences to the political landscape and economical environment that impacts all of us.

I believe that it is imperative for a responsible company to understand these relationships so that strategies can be implemented in a way commensurate with the challenges it faces and with an understanding of the topography in which they operate.  UAT Group and its subsidiaries, operate with the understanding that what we do matters and as such our decisions bear consequences.  We have enacted a business strategy to not only create jobs but to sustain employment with proposed tuition assistance programs and re-training initiatives.

So, with the above outlined, 2017 behind us and before looking ahead, let’s take a retrospective look at a two-year long effort to get us to a year that I view as a significant milestone for this company and its shareholders.

“Two years ago, we implemented a holistic strategy that went beyond merely ensuring survival but focused on delivering top-line growth.”

2015 through 2016 marked a professional period for UAT Group so climacteric that it presented the very real potential for failure.  We had many substantially complex obstacles to overcome and the challenges were many.  This was a parlous period for the company, so far reaching that many had difficulty envisioning a path where success was a likely outcome.  I can say, not as a point of ego or arrogance, that I never doubted our success nor do I fault those who advised that it was time to close the doors as it were.  I knew that with more than thirty million dollars in assets, a stable of completed product lines across multiple divisions poised and prepared for launch, a calendar that outlined the delivery of products for the next seven years and a population of shareholders counting on us, that failure was not something we could tolerate or consider within the vernacular of UAT Groups universe.

In 2017, we made significant progress in our execution strategy and achieved many core mission objectives that helped to ameliorate company specific market metrics that were less than favorable. Despite the challenges, it was a compelling year with continued operational growth and ongoing progress in developing high-value technologies. 

The end of last year not only marked year five for us but it also represented the year we overcame significant obstacles, most of which went well beyond the typical hurdles companies face when striving for success.  I attribute this ability to forge ahead and work towards corporate objectives to a team comprised of individuals with intact self-fortitude and discipline that drew on their collective strength to endure and emerge successfully as a stronger company with improved shareholder value potential.

Two years ago, we implemented a holistic strategy that went beyond merely ensuring survival but focused on delivering top-line growth.  Two years later that strategy has delivered us to the precipice of success.  As a result, I am very excited to announce that we will begin 2018 perfectly poised to complete all the objectives we defined from the beginning of this journey.

We continued to position ourselves to meet tomorrow's challenges

We have executed on many important decisions that have strengthened the operational and capital posture of the company.  We have evolved our product lines, expanded our team, improved market metrics, ensured broad accountability, and aggrandized our resources. Each decision has slowly and methodically placed UAT Group in the best possible position for the next decision to be made and as a result, has created opportunities that will continue to impact the company in ways that will be far reaching.  Recently we fundamentally restructured the capital structure of the company to reflect a company more in line with its peers on senior exchanges so we could consider additional opportunities.  This is indicative of an aggressive strategic action plan we defined almost two years ago in an effort to course correct the company’s trajectory.  This initiative has resulted in substantial progress in three key areas:

Up-listing- The execution of a comprehensive action plan designed to accelerate the company’s momentum towards an eventual up-listing to a senior exchange.
Market Oversight- We restructured and/or settled debt to better position the company’s corporate balance sheet ahead of independent audits in anticipation of future opportunities for expansion and institutional financing.
Delivery of Product – UAT, a UAT Group subsidiary, delivered its first product successfully proving that it has the ability to not only generate significant revenue but be a disruptive force across multiple market segments.
While I am mindful that we did not reach all of our financial performance priorities this year, I am very proud of our achievements and encouraged by the team’s ability to support a steady cadence of increasingly complex operations that strengthen the company’s leadership across many market segments.

Identifying shortcomings should not be a point of embarrassment but an attribute of strength

To be a cross industry disruptive force that challenges the way we and others not only think but how we, as a company, approach problems or exact a solution, you must first be willing to be self-critical.  In keeping with this doctrine there were a few things we identified early on that needed to be ameliorated, augmented or otherwise corrected.

We needed to address market liquidity concerns, for without the proper liquidity, shareholder value cannot be assured nor can a company be viewed as an enterprise level opportunity by financial institutions.  To address this matter, we focused heavily on fostering a more open engagement with shareholders and the market as a whole.  We improved transparencies, audited the company, made corrections to previous filings when and where necessary, expanded our public relations effort, forged strategic alliances to bolster productivity and partnered with those who brought value to our e-commerce presence ahead of our first product launch. The result; a nearly 8000% increase in market liquidity, 7000% increase in daily volume and 2000% increase in dollars traded.
 
We needed to demonstrate, our ability to generate ideas, advance multidiscipline design acuity, the ability to improve manufacturing efficiencies and a proficiency to deliver successfully, superior high-quality products.  To that end we succeeded and launched our first product, a scaled down by-product of a smart fabric we have been working on since the beginning - Hygieia. When we launched Hygieia we knew it would be the beginning of an extensive product line we had planned with nearly limitless scalability.  What we did not know was the overwhelmingly positive response we would get from shareholders and commercial industries across the globe.  Since launching Hygieia we have engaged dozens of manufacturers interested in the potential of having UAT manufacture their products for them using our antimicrobial Hygieia technology.  The response has been stunning and to be honest quite humbling.  Years of dedicated and focused efforts being embraced by others and on the verge of bearing significant returns.
 
We needed to prepare for what we knew was coming.  If we executed as planned, we would need to have the resources to expand quickly while maintaining control of company branding, product quality and a strict production calendar.  We identified and engaged industry manufacturing partners, financial institutions for potential financing in 2018 and initiated dialogs with those who could facilitate the company’s intent to be listed with one of the senior exchanges.  In doing so, we now have the necessary relationships we need to be successful.
Efficiency should be an obsession and a pursuit that is without cessation

We identified areas to be targeted for improvement and we continued to further streamline operational processes to support product launch and delivery.  We implemented far-reaching cost-savings actions by implementing administrative cost reductions, reducing manufacturing costs and streamlining our fulfilment apparatus.  We increased proportional investments in targeted product inventory, marketing strategies and s-curve data analytics to direct product innovation.

Our efforts to make the UAT Group more dynamic and less sensitive to market fluctuations continued to bear fruit.  Implemented efficiencies and effective inventory control ensured that UAT continued to strengthen its cash flow, cash position and product awareness while mitigating remaining over-runs.

As a result, UAT Group is a more nimble, flexible, opportunity driven, global and customer oriented technology manufacturer.  Research and development combined with a scalable business model will be the factors that significantly contribute to our success, present opportunities for growth and improve profitability.  A focus on efficiency increases cross-company capabilities to include expansion of our dynamic and elite team members.  With a company poised for expansion, having the proper personnel to support growth and deliver products is essential.

Looking forward requires a disciplined approach to evaluating core competencies

When drafting or otherwise coordinating a strategic corporate action plan it is essential to be clear on what the company actually does, how it does it, why it does it and what the long-term objectives are.  For UAT Group, core competencies must be forged from corporate tenants bolstered by the founding principles that defined our guiding ethos more than five years ago.  Seems simple enough but, understanding UAT Group at the onset of 2018 can be challenging and requires a longer view of a complex institution with operational objectives that at times may seem singular in nature or at times too diverse.  This is especially true when vision meets execution and when strategies are multilayered or designed to build upon one another.  In short, UAT Group needs to be agile and dynamic in order to maintain an innovative culture that is not in keeping with trends but, rather creates trends.  After all, innovation is the fundamental underpinning upon which this company has been built and is sustained. We must constantly evolve in keeping with a tempo that is always several steps ahead of what is needed, known and/or desired.

It has everything to do with a passion for vision and absolutely nothing to do with fixing something that is broken.  Rather, our experience over the past five years has taught us to be persistent and vigilant when looking ahead.  We began to see that the defense and technology industry was going through a shift in focus, driven by the phenomenon of data capturing, the maturation of analytics and the evolution of artificial intelligence or AI.  We began to see a space in the technology markets where we as innovators could capitalize on the convergence of these events where new opportunities both in technology and business would be well served by UAT innovation.

We did not hesitate or wait for others to lead. We ended our start-up phase and focused our considerable resources to the production of final design prototypes.  We trimmed top line excess in a way that would not negatively affect the bottom line.  We refocused our efforts to reimagine innovation in the twenty first century based on current and future needs as we envisioned them.  This meant an acute focus on technologies that could be interconnected and supportive of one another.  Technology with an integrated capability that was scalable and could be built upon as mechanisms intertwined throughout many product lines across many divisions.  This is what our clients and customers need for the burgeoning new era we are entering.

A paradigm shifting UAT Group future is coming and things will never be the same

We begin 2018 as a fundamentally different company, changed forever with potentially the broadest market segment product portfolio in our industry.  With legacy issues addressed to course correct our operational trajectory, we emerge with a strong foundation to build a yet stronger company.  With emerging applications in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, swarm technology, digital health and reinforcement learning, we are front and center of a technological renaissance that will continue to shape the future of humanity for generations to come.

Our strategic imperatives implemented, we now have for the first time, a revenue positive business model.  With double and triple digit growth across various metrics we now reflect a company whose posture is squarely aimed at success.  This is in part due to Hygieia but it is also just the beginning. Hygieia will see the launch of further improved sock designs, boxer briefs and bedding product lines but it will also lead our entry into antimicrobial touch surfaces and other unexplored medical industry firsts.  In addition, this smart textile will also cross pollinate further product development across all UAT divisions supporting the development of our B.A.T. Suit exoskeleton, Scorpion Security Drone and H.A.V.O.C. third generation camouflage.

In keeping with our brand commitments, Hygieia represents a piece of the puzzle whose aggregate defines a set of strategic imperatives that will transform UAT Group into the broad scope business, data, cognitive and security technology company with the potential to, and in concert with other industry leaders, change the world.

Looking forward, we continue to implement our strategies and as a result, have a busy year ahead of us. The first quarter of this year will bring an increased operational launch of the BioTech Division with an expanded Hygieia product line.  Additionally, the third quarter delivery of orthopedic medical devices through strategic partnerships, signals the dawn of a sophisticated and mature corporate division with its focus on expansion across a broad product line.

Thanks to strategic manufacturing partnerships with companies like NextCast, as well as others to be announced in the near future, we initiated our expansion objectives to include next generation trauma care, digital health and quality of life initiatives, empowering people to embrace technology as a daily partner in their lives.  I have directed the company’s vast resources in innovation and technology to seek new ways to not only improve technologies surrounding healthcare but integrate them in a way that fundamentally improves the quality of the care delivered.  Working with partners throughout the globe and across many disciplines we will be able to support powerful research and development that can provide practical guidance and advanced solutions to global leaders implementing health systems and solutions.

Additionally, we take very seriously the threats to the environment, the depletion of our natural resources and the necessity of innovators to introduce solutions to address the coming social and environmental impact.  Over the past 5 years, in preparation of a full divisional launch, we worked to design a stable of clean technology products with the ability to offset and/or reduce the carbon footprint of our products, manufacturing processes and industrialized nations. We are committed to supporting our government and customers in reducing their environmental impact by providing energy efficient products produced via sustainable processes that, either stand alone, or operate in support of existing infrastructure.  

The Helix Power Station, PowerCube and our most recent innovations in bio-electricity all represent initiatives in furtherance of our commitment to researching innovative solutions to complex challenges. We also continue to share our zero CO2 emissions technology across all divisions with design advancements from our GreenTech division influencing multiple divisions within the company.  With testing currently underway, our Aerospace &amp; Defense division is scheduled to begin offering our new zero-carbon footprint security drone platform later this year.

Objectives for a brighter tomorrow

Providing a path to innovation, environmental sustainability and demonstrating an ethical responsibility to all that share our planet is what a manufacturing leader does.  UAT Group and its subsidiaries will continue to build on our commitment as leaders of industry and stewards of our planet.  We will continue to leverage our global resources and presence to improve the lives of all, through responsible technology. In accordance with this commitment, I have directed our team to set our most aggressive environmentally conscious expansion targets to date and through 2025.

It is now the company’s official targeted objective to manufacture in accordance with bluesign®, Green Seal and by 2025 meet ISO 14001 standards.  In addition, we have designed a framework that will have all six divisions of UAT fully operational over the next 3 years; one wholly owned subsidiary added, via acquisition, to the UAT Group holding company per year for the next 5 years; and initial construction of a corporate headquarters.  To be completed over the next four years, UAT Groups new headquarters will be designed to house corporate offices, research and development complex, technology demonstration facilities, manufacturing operations, fulfillment processes, a shareholder/client welcome center and support public education initiatives.  Our expansion will not be solely focused on profits but will be done honoring our commitments to our country, fellow shareholders and an environment under siege across the globe.

UAT Group remains committed to building an enterprise level company with a global footprint that does more than innovates technology for products to be sold.  UAT Group has always been and remains the example of what to do when given the responsibility of being an industry leader.  UAT Group will continue to focus on corporate sustainability and responsibility as a cornerstone of its business model as well as in developed and emerging markets in which it operates.

I would like to once again thank my UAT Group family for their support, tireless commitment and loyalty to a vision that many thought was not possible yet has empowered us to contribute in a way that matters.  Together we can build that which will make a difference for generations to come and be the clarion call for others to join in our pursuit of re-imaging what is possible through innovative thinking and responsible technology.

On so no longer a penny stock, but still not badly priced at $5.60/share.
So I was wondering why it seemed to not be moving at all the last few days and found that trading has been temporarily suspended. I was a bit confused by this as the company is starting to grow, actually turning profits and has been increasing production from their main lithium mine. 

Then I found it, a news story from yesterday that I missed. Toyota has announced that it is buying a 15% stake in Orocobre for USD$232million! Together they are planning a $279mill investment in the site to increase production capacity from 17,500 tons (10% global demand) to 42,500 tons / year.
From Toyota's end they want to assure a stable supply of lithium for automobile production.

I was talking yesterday on someone else's post about the ever increasing demand for lithium. This same article claims global demand will double by 2021.

Acorn Energy Agrees to Sell DSIT Interest for $5.8M to Focus Resources on Growing its OmniMetrix Remote Monitoring and Control (IoT) Business

OTC Disclosure &amp; News Service

-

WILMINGTON, Del., Jan. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acorn Energy, Inc. (OTCQB:ACFN), announced today that it has reached an agreement to sell its remaining 41.15% interest in DSIT Solutions Ltd. for $5.8 million, before fees and taxes, to an Israeli investor group. The sale of the DSIT stake represents one of the final steps in refocusing Acorn on the long-term growth potential of its OmniMetrix wireless remote monitoring and control services for gas pipelines and stand-by generators for cell towers, medical facilities, data centers, public transportation systems and other facilities. The transaction is expected to close within about 30 days, subject to specific closing conditions, including approval of the Israeli Antitrust Authority. 

OMNIMETRIX.png


DSIT Solutions provides underwater sonar and acoustic detection systems and is 50% owned by Israel-based Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. DSIT generated revenues of $17.9 million in the latest-twelve-month period ended September 30, 2017.

Acorn CEO Jan Loeb commented, “Concluding a two-year restructuring effort, we have executed an agreement to complete Acorn’s transformation from an undercapitalized, diversified holding company with negative operating cash flow, to a focused leader in the growing market for the remote monitoring and control of industrial assets with a solid balance sheet.

“Proceeds from the sale will be used to eliminate Acorn’s debt, satisfy liabilities and provide working capital. Following the transaction, we expect to have approximately $2 million of cash, which we believe is sufficient to fund the operations of Acorn and OmniMetrix for the foreseeable future. We plan to update our shareholders in greater detail on our financial positon and growth strategy following the closing of the DSIT sale.”

sdbrady5;1516643248;7s7h3n;;10;;4;"I’m new to the penny stocks so I plan to get torched. After reading about InterCloud Systems and a once prominent company that traded in the high 60$ range in 2014, now is at the bottom of the barrel .003. After what seems like riding the tech wave at the time and taking on toxic debt and diluting shares they find themselves here.  The ceo has said the right things about the turn around and restructuring ,I’d still guess bankruptcy is still on the table. I love a good comeback story and betting a few hundred bucks on something even if there is a 1% chance of it happening still seems like a bet I’m willing to make.

MyNameIsRobPaulson;1516649387;7s89aw;;24;;29;"So after hearing some hype on this stock, I've done some DD, invested, and am curious as to what others think about BPMX. 

Everyone seems to be short on it, due to it, you know, being a penny stock and all.

BUT, what's more exciting to me, is the possibility of this company actually achieving real success. 

I'll focus on BPX-01:

**BPX-01** - Its an acne gel that delivers minocycline, a very effective acne treatment in use since the 70s, topically.  Previous to this, minocycline has been only available as a pill, and when taken orally has a METRIC SHIT-TON of side effects. like... 
 
From WebMD:  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lightheadedness, dizziness, or a feeling of spinning may occur. 

SO... 

BPX-01 has passed Phase 2b - and was proven to work.  

&gt;""In a phase 2a clinical study, BPX-01 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in facial P. acnes after four weeks of once-daily treatment with no measurable systemic levels of minocycline and no drug-related adverse effects.""

My thought is, if BPX-01 has all of the benefits of an acne medication that has been used since the 70s (proving it has a lasting, stable demand) but effectively gets rid of the side effects, how much of an opportunity is this?  Could we see BPX-01 on shelves in pharmacies around the country?  Granted, anything can happen, but also, what if they could succeed here? What would that mean for the market cap/share price?  


These are my only concerns.  There are already three topical anti-biotics for acne on the market... but, they do have side effects.  I would be curious to hear if BPX-01 has clear advantages over the following existing gels:

**Clindamycin:** The most commonly prescribed topical antibiotic for treating acne, available in multiple forms, including lotion, gel, or a liquid solution. Those taking clindamycin for acne generally experience few side effects, which can include mild skin irritation.

**Erythromycin:** Stops the growth of bacteria. Also available in lotion, gel, or liquid form. Often applied twice daily.

**Dapsone:** Another prescribed topical antibiotic for acne. Side effects are rare but can include peeling, red and dry skin.

They are attempting to limit operating costs by being based in secondary airports in large areas. Currently unprofitable, as they have not begun any flights, which are planned for Summer 2018.

WordSlinger81;1516815679;7sot0j;;0;;1;"Seen some chatter about this the last few days. Volume is way up.  News from the last 48 hours:

Halitron has returned 56 million restricted common shares and 80 million Life’s Time Capsule Services, Inc.’s (“LTCP”) Preferred Stock C shares to LTCP in exchange for the receipt of a note payable for $3 million, bearing interest of 4%, which matures in July 2020. 

In the transaction, the assets sold to LTCP in the original transaction will revert to a Halitron asset on its balance sheet.  In 2020, upon receipt of the $3 million principal and interest along with Halitron’s Board of Directors’ approval, Management will submit corporation action paperwork to FINRA for the issuance of a cash dividend to its shareholders, of which record, and payment dates will be announced post receipts of the settlement of the note payable for $3 million.

Other Updates:

The audit work is under way and is expected to complete in the first half of 2018 with the objective to uplist to the OTC QB.

**Halitron has begun to buy back shares in the open market according to the “black-out” periods disclosed in its filing to OTC Markets with the objective to increase its share price to $0.01 per share.** The $0.01 share price is one of the requirements by OTC markets to uplist to the OTC QB.  The number of shares and price paid will be listed in its quarterly filings.

The acquisition of the Hopp Companies, Inc.’s assets, and the subsequent transition to Halitron’s infrastructure, has been very successful to date.  Over the past week, half of the production equipment has been relocated to Newtown, CT and will be set up and tested for full production over the coming weeks.  Management is forecasting to exit the 5,000-square foot facility in New Hyde Park, NY by the end of March 2018, upon which time Halitron’s operating expenses should decrease dramatically.


Management is now drafting the strategic plan to utilize previously acquired assets, specifically the two brands, PiecesInPlaces and CinchSigns, within Halitron’s infrastructure.


Management is continually seeking acquisition opportunities and has recently received communication on an excellent strategic acquisition that would complement its current operating business.  More information will be released as we enter due diligence on the target company.";;HAON;

Nutra Pharma Corporation is inviting visitors to explore its new websites at www.nutrapharma.com and www.nyloxin.com. The new websites have been designed to provide the ultimate user-friendly experience with improved navigation and functionality throughout.
CORAL SPRINGS, Fla., Jan. 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- —via OTC PR WIRE-- -- Nutra Pharma Corporation (OTC:NPHC), a biotechnology company developing drugs for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and HIV and that also markets the over-the-counter (OTC) pain drugs; Nyloxin® and Pet Pain-Away™, announced today that they have updated their corporate website at www.nutrapharma.com as well as their product website at www.nyloxin.com. The newly redesigned websites offer quick and easy access to essential information and features that offer a more comprehensive understanding of the Company's products and services. The website also has a comprehensive investor section with updated company news and events, financial and stock information, SEC filings and corporate governance information.


""We've been extremely busy with product rollouts, distribution partnerships and international registrations for our OTC drugs,"" stated Rik J Deitsch, CEO of Nutra Pharma. ""Included in all of this activity is the launch of our newly-designed Nutra Pharma website,"" he continued. ""We initially redesigned the Nyloxin website a few months ago to feature ‘Corky' our friendly cobra handing out Nyloxin samples to people of need. Now, the Nutra Pharma website is more user-friendly, easier to navigate and easier to update with the intention to keep our shareholders and customers informed on a timely basis. This new, visually appealing website is essential to stay current as we expand sales and marketing efforts for our OTC products through international distributors and US Federal government buyers,"" he concluded.

Nutra Pharma recently announced expanded sales and marketing plans for Nyloxin® and Pet Pain-Away™. This included a direct marketing campaign for Pet Pain-Away™ and, more recently, a partnership with EuroAmerican IP to register Nyloxin® through their Federal Supply Schedule contract. The successful addition of Nyloxin® to the Federal Supply Schedule will allow for sale to buyers within the Federal government in response to the opioid crisis and the Opiate Reduction Initiative.

harpyeaglelove;1516932517;7t1dve;;1;;1;"WSTRF is western uranium corporation.  It's got 20 million shares and a market cap of something like 20 million.  This company owns the 2nd largest collection of uranium mines in the united states, and has its own permitted mill, and one of the lowest costs of production in the industry.  The only problem is that uranium prices are extremely low right now, $23.  However, they have a large vanadium deposit, and vanadium prices are up something like $11 a pound from 1 or 2 when the properties were purchased.

At this point, small purchases of 5k or less move this stock 5 or 10% in a day.  It's EXTREMELY thinly traded, despite being the 2nd largest uranium company in the united states.  

all it's projects are permitted, and it's basically ready to go into production at the right uranium and vanadium prices.

I'm down 50%, I fucked up and bought at the peak a month ago - and it immediately dropped 20% in one day, I have then watched it drop another 30%.  It's painful to watch, to be honest.  I've never made such a bad mistake before in investing in regards to the speed of the price drop.  I invested way too much instead of averaging down.

What do you folks think about this company?  I'd LOVE to buy at these prices, it's a fucking steal IMO.  I'm somewhat considering doubling down, but I'm already pretty heavily invested so I'm hesitant.

MBOT called @ 1.02 now 1.04, saw baby jump to 1.11. Could still see a jump, but chances are getting slim.

CAPR Called at 1.70 now 2.13, could still make it to original swing prediction @ 2.50

IDXG called at 1.09 now 1.14, this actually still looks lile a strong buy. Can hit 1.30 easily, watch for slight dip and buy is my advice

PTX called at 2.47 now 2.41. Also ditching this one, could see jump later but I've moved funds elsewhere for now.

CYTR called at 1.77 now at 2.03, saw jump to 2.25.


Here are the swing calls for the next one-two weeks

MBRX -chart looks good for a small 10-20% rise, keep your eye on it

MBOT - if this is gonna pop it'll be before Feb probably, keep on radar for next few days.


SCON - this price level is ripe for another jump, very nice drop last week for watchers, if 1.09 holds I would recommend a strong buy.

CYTR - Keep on radar, could rise up to 2.50+ but will drop after it hits 2.50ish if it hits the PT. Sell after each rise and buy back the dip if this continues to look strong this week.


GLBS - The Greek Shitters (including the dreaded TOPS &amp; DRYS) will probably see some action this week. I see 10-20% very possible across the board, sell immediately after the rise as these will continue to drop and R/S after their infrequent jumps.


IDXG - Still looks like a strong contender from my first list. I don't see it falling below 1.05, as it should have solid floor around 1.07. Can very well run to 1.20+";;Swings for this week and stats on all previous stock calls;

The big one for me is the Trike therapy that uses natural killer or NK cells.  Novartis received FDA approval for its cell therapy. This is great news but it comes at a cost of nearly $500,000 for a one-time treatment based on CAR-T being the therapy of choice.  GTBP's therapy is more customizable and designed for a much wider market application.  I know...very technical...but this is what I see.  GTBP is not an overnight ""hype"" stock.

Innovus Pharma’s Apeaz™ Drug for Arthritis Pain Relief Approved for Commercialization in Canada as a Natural Health Product

Jan 30, 2018
OTC Disclosure &amp; News Service

-

Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Innovus Pharma"" or the “Company”) (OTCQB Venture Market: INNV), an emerging commercial-stage pharmaceutical company that delivers safe, innovative and effective over-the-counter medicine and consumer care products to improve men’s and women's health and respiratory diseases, today announced the approval of its Natural Health Product (“NHP”) License in Canada for its Apeaz™ product. Apeaz™ is a drug in the U.S. for arthritis pain relief. Apeaz™ will either be sold by itself as an NHP in Canada or in the future, potentially sold with the Company’s supplement, ArthriVarx™, a nutritional supplement designed to promote and maximize joint health, when that product is presented to Health Canada for approval.

“Apeaz™ ia an excellent complement to our fast growing portfolio of products available within the Canadian market,” said Innovus CEO Dr. Bassam Damaj. “Apeaz™ is our seventh product on the Canadian market including Zestra®, Zestra Glide® and Uxor™ (EjectDelay™) marketed by Orimed Pharma, UriVarx® through our recently announced partnership with Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Vesele® and Xyralid® through our own marketing and sales efforts in that country. Apeaz™ is one of our core revenue-generating products in the U.S. and we are currently expected to launch the product in Canada by the end of 2018.”

About Apeaz™

Apeaz™ arthritis cream is a fast acting, FDA monograph pain relieving drug and over-the-counter medication cream. Apeaz™ is not only formulated to soothe the pain in joints and muscles like other arthritis and sports creams, but it also contains ingredients such as methyl-sulfonyl methane (MSM) and glucosamine sulfate known to help damaged cartilage for stronger and more pressure resistant joints.1 Apeaz™ is indicated to relieve the following: acute pain, arthritis pain, athletic injuries, muscle soreness, muscle stiffness, muscle and joint pain, simple backache and strains and sprains.

To the Company’s knowledge, Apeaz™ is the only OTC monograph drug published and commercialized to reduce all signs and symptoms of arthritis in the collagen induced mouse model. In addition, our proprietary deep penetration formulation was shown to penetrate the joint tissues where the inflammation and joint damage take place (J Immunol April 1, 2009, 182 (1 Supplement) 50.20). Apeaz™ drug facts in the U.S. are available on DailyMed at https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=9f36e226-9e8b-4282-9699-84fc7ac499c4 and in Canada at https://health-products.canada.ca/lnhpd-bdpsnh/index-eng.jsp.

According to Markets &amp; Markets (October 2016 Report Code: MD 4660), the market for the arthritis and other related joint pain is estimated to be at approximately $850 million in 2016 and projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.0% during 2017 to 2021. For more information on Apeaz™, please visit our website at www.apeaz.com.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northsight Capital Inc. (""NCAP"") (OTC PINK:NCAP) announced today that it has signed a non-binding LOI to acquire Uptick Newswire, Inc., a leading newswire company for public Microcap companies. The latest statistics show that there are over 11,000 micro-cap companies with a combined market cap of over $500 billion. 

Uptick Newswire is one of the leading outlets for micro-cap companies to display their company’s current and future potential, giving CEOs the opportunity to tell their story directly to qualified investors, brokerage houses, journalists, bloggers, and influencers. Uptick currently interviews approximately 50 CEOs a month on its Radio broadcast and via video segments, featuring those interviews on its website and allowing the shareholders of the individual companies to watch and/or listen to the interview.

Uptick’s content can be found on  Audio Boom, iTunes, iHeart Radio, Investors Hangout, Google Play, YouTube, Stitcher, aCast, Spreaker, Podcast Directory, Player FM, BluBrry, TuneIn and Biz Talk Radio. 

The radio show and podcast generate revenue from fees paid by participants, while also driving traffic to UPTICK Newswire’s website. The show increases brand awareness by virtue of reaching hundreds of thousands of listeners and improves brand legitimacy by increasing transparency of the Micro and Nano-cap stock markets and providing education about these markets to investors worldwide.

Terms of the proposed acquisition were not released.  Completion of the transaction is subject to funding, board approval and negotiation and execution of definitive agreements.

Las Vegas, NV (FSCwire) - Adama Technologies Corp. (OTCPINK: ADAC) announced today that they have been awarded a new defense contract to manufacture jury links, a crucial component of the landing gear for the F-15 fighter jet.  Adama Technologies Corp., through their wholly owned subsidiary Alpine Industries, will be building the jury link for both sides of the aircraft.  The contract was awarded in two parts, with the first order creating $225,000 in new revenue to the company.   The Company stated that the second portion of the order, which is expected to be approved in early March, is worth an additional $900,000 in revenue. 

“We are extremely excited to get this news and are confident this will be the first of several new contracts for the company,” stated Harold Tanner, President of Adama Technologies.  “Our current plan is to begin production on this initial order by mid-February.”

The Company stated that they are continuing to bid additional projects and contracts and expect to be awarded additional contracts as the current administration is allocating additional funds for military and defense upgrades.  Mr. Tanner commented, “The current business climate within this industry is looking extremely strong.  There are lots of additional manufacturing opportunities and new contracts open for bid every single day.  We are very optimistic and see a huge opportunity to increase our contracts and significantly grow our annual revenue.”

Brannden715;1517507409;7ukis1;;9;;2;"So I am about 2 months into investing.  Started with 350 and I’m up to 660 but I’ve had some beginners luck, maybe?  I got lucky with the MYSZ pumps and also TROV and IGC at the right times.  I am finally ready to deposit 2k and have more fun.  I already know that I shouldn’t be investing money that I need.  That is not the case.  

So this is where I can’t decide what to do;  Keep using robinhood and take advantage of the commission free trading and Gold status or open a Margin account on Td ameritrade with the 2k min. Deposit and many more stocks?  Any advice is greatly appreciated.  Btw, congrats to anyone who jumped in BPMX today.  ";;Robinhood Gold or TD margin?;

zas11s;1517869614;7vil31;;21;;28;"So If you are new here I am sure you are wondering what is $BPMX and why there is so much discussion about the stock on this subreddit. Most of us (myself included) post memes about the stock so I felt it was about time to actually sink our teeth into a basic stock and business discussion about BioPharmX. Most of you probably already know most of this but I feel It all needed addressed in one location finally so we can discuss. Here is what I found:


**What the hell is BioPharmX($BPMX)?**


Here's a great quote directly from their website:

“BPMX is committed to providing innovative healthcare products through its unique, patented platform technologies for pharmaceutical, over-the-counter (OTC) and supplement applications.”
In plain terms they are a company trying to develop over the counter supplements primarily for acne.


**Why should I be excited about acne medicine?**


Well this is r/PennyStocks after all. Penny stocks can often be very speculative. Think high risk high reward. Great penny stocks are often companies you’ve never heard of or companies with strange products. I personally... to this very day still struggle with acne and it sucks. But let's put aside the personal interest many of us have with curing our acne. There is money in pharmaceuticals. Everyone knows the pharmaceutical business is here to stay and believe it or not one of the “safer” bets in my personal opinion. 


**But why is everyone here so hype?**


Well most of us on this sub got in on the stock when it was just $.12 or $.13. So to see it climb past $.20 makes everyone significantly happy. The best part is, it is only the beginning.


**Why hold?**


There is a lot to be excited about. So here's the latest news and what we can look forward to:


-Wall street analyst rated $BPMX a strong buy
-Stock officially NOT reverse splitting.
-(Rumor) Possible Vivo Partnership?


1.) Annual ROTH Conference Date: March 11st  2018 

The ROTH Conference is basically a dick showing contest. 550 companies come from around the world and showcase their company and products. This should be great exposure for BPMX and if I am a betting man after the conference we will see higher volume and maybe a price jump.


2.) BPMX announces their earnings and possible FDA approval Date: March 22nd 2018
This could be huge either way. Hopefully we hear good news.


3.) Completion of BPX-01 and BPX-04, clinical trials  Date: June 2018

FULL DISCLOSURE: I know nothing about clinical trials 

So far all my “novice” research shows the trials are going great. BPX-01 has completed phase 2b studies and BPX-04 has begun phase 2 studies. Whatever that means lol. One can speculate though once they are completed and approved we should see a massive price jump.


**So in conclusion,**

$BPMX is a solid bet and their future looks very promising. Most of you probably already knew most of this but I feel It all needed addressed in one location for new users sake.

**What do you guys think?**

Hugo Saavedra, CEO of Trimax Corporation and Saavy Naturals Inc., stated, “We are strong believers that diversification is the key to success and are extremely pleased to announce our intent to diversify into the fast-growing marijuana sector with an ecommerce company that brings a leading edge mobile technological platform to the forefront of this billion dollar industry.” He also stated, “This acquisition will allow for Trimax to benefit from two wholly-owned subsidiaries that will bring multiple revenue streams into the company.”

The state of Vermont just recently passed legislation for recreational sales and was the latest addition to the already existing 30 states, nine of which allow for recreational sales, that are now allowing for the sale of medicinal and/or recreational marijuana. 

Recreational Dispensaries.com is in the process of launching in the state of California but expects to expand into every state across the U.S. that offers medicinal and recreational cannabis sales, over the next several months.

Both parties have already exchanged documents in order to complete a thorough due diligence process and expect to enter into a Definitive Agreement in order to complete the acquisition within the next 10 business days.

Hugo and Debra Saavedra, Saavy Naturals Inc.’s, CEO and President, gained instant popularity for their all-natural body care product line after being spotlighted and appearing on ABC’s hit show Shark Tank.

Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Innovus Pharma"" or the “Company”) (OTCQB Venture Market: INNV), an emerging commercial-stage pharmaceutical company that delivers safe, innovative and effective over-the-counter medicine and consumer care products to improve men’s and women's health and respiratory diseases, today announced that the human clinical trial for the patented formulation in its product UriVarx® product for bladder health was published in the peer reviewed journal, BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (Schoendorfer et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2018) 18:42). The study was conducted by the team of Dr. Niikee Schoendorfer in Australia in collaboration with the Company’s UriVarx® licensing partner Seipel Group, Ltd. The outcome of this study demonstrated both statistical significance and clinical relevance in reducing symptoms of Overactive Bladder (“OAB”), urinary frequency and/or urgency and incontinence.

In this study, one hundred and fifty participants (59% female, aged; mean ± SD; 63.5 ± 13.1 years) took part. At week 8, urinary day frequency was significantly lower (OR 0.01; 95%CI 0.01 to 0.02; p &lt; 0.001) in response to treatment (mean ± SD; 7.69 ± 2.15/day) compared to placebo (10.95 ± 2.47/day). Similarly, episodes of nocturia were significantly fewer (OR 0.03; 95%CI 0.02 to 0.05) after 8 weeks of treatment (2.16 ± 1.49/night) versus placebo (3.14 ± 1.36/night). Symptoms of urgency (OR 0.02; 95%CI 0.01 to 0.03), and total incontinence (OR 0.03; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.06) were also lower (all p &lt; 0.01) in the treatment group. Significant improvements in quality of life were reported after treatment in comparison to placebo. No significant side effects were observed resulting in withdrawal from treatment.

“We are very happy with the publication of the strong clinical data on the patented formulation in our best-selling product, UriVarx® for bladder health” stated Dr. Bassam Damaj, President and Chief Executive Officer of Innovus Pharma. “The publication of the clinical trial gives a tremendous boost to the clinical credibility of this product and we hope will translate into increased sales of this product from consumers who want a product for this disease indication that is scientifically sound and clinically-tested,” he continued.

Las Vegas, NV (FSCwire) - Adama Technologies Corp. (OTCPINK: ADAC) announced today their target completion date for a U.S. government, military contract where the company is manufacturing landing gear components for the F-15 for the United States Air Force.  This contract, valued at just over $200,000.00, was awarded in April of 2016.  The Company stated that they are in the final stages of manufacturing and anticipate shipping the entire order by February 15, 2018.  
 
Harold Tanner, President of Adama Technologies, stated, ""This is great news for our Company.  It is always exciting when we successfully complete another contract.  This allows us to move quickly into production on some of our newer contracts and will enable us to continue our steady focus on bidding additional contracts.""
 
The Company has continued to be focused on development of their new, online retail outlet, CRYX,  as well as utilizing their technology platforms to create additional verticals and revenue centers for the Company.  While vigorously pursuing these exciting new ventures, the Company simultaneously continues to grow and develop their existing operations and have been very aggressive in acquiring additional contracts, having bid on over $1 million in new projects already in 2018.
 
""This is an exciting time for the Company because we are really experiencing growth and development in all facets of our business.  From our new ventures to our current operations, we are really excited to see what tremendous potential we have in store over the next 12 months,"" concluded Mr. Tanner.

The Copperstone mine is a fully permitted past producing gold mine (historically produced around 500,000 Oz of gold) and has a measured amount of around 300,00 Oz of high grade gold to still be mined (at an average of 10g/t). The company is working on a pre feasibility study which will be finished in Q2 of 2018 which will have an updated resource estimate and which will allow us to understand how they will mine the remaining ore. It has extensive infrastructure already in place (Mill, Power, Water, Labs, Roads – conservative estimates to replace would be around $60 million) which would allow the company to be in production in 9 – 12 months from the production decision date (Q4 2018 – Q1 2019). Furthermore, Kerr has several exploration areas which have already shown extremely promising drilling results according to their latest press releases.

I think that this is a great value buy, considering that Gold is looking up this year and the grades on this thing are insane.

LOCKPORT, Ill., Feb. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

Via OTC PR Wire -- The Board of Directors of IDGlobal Corp., a Colorado corporation (OTC:IDGC) (""IDGC""), is today pleased to announce the declaration of a special dividend in the form of common stock of Encounter Technologies, Inc., a Colorado corporation (US.ENTI.PK) (""ENTI""), to the holders of IDGC's common stock as at February 23, 2018 (""Record Date"").

The holder of each one share of IDGC's common stock on the Record Date will receive one share of common stock in ENTI. IDGC is today notifying the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (""FINRA"") of the occurrence of this corporate action (the ""Dividend""), under which the Dividend will be distributed following FINRA's review and approval of the same.

The Dividend has been made possible by Sebastien DuFort, IDGC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. DuFort, by virtue of his prior dealings with ENTI, has entered into an agreement with IDGC and ENTI; whereby, he delivered certain of the shares he owns in ENTI to IDGC for distribution to and for the benefit of IDGC's shareholders. Mr. DuFort stated, ""My interest is and always has been to fully-develop IDGlobal to its maximum potential for the benefit of its shareholders. ENTI has gone through some tough times, but under its present management over the past couple of years, and because of a collaborative effort between IDGC and ENTI, I think we can develop a comprehensive plan of operations that will best serve our shareholders and others having business with IDGC, ENTI, and their respective subsidiaries.""

IDGC, ENTI, their subsidiaries and direct coventurers, respectively and collectively seek safe-harbor in accordance with the provisions of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995 for certain forward-looking statements made by any of them in this announcement, as the same are defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A forward-looking statement is defined as a statement that cannot sustain itself as merely a historical fact. A forward-looking statement predicts, projects, or uses future events as expectations or possibilities. These statements can often be misleading, as they can be mistaken for factual statements, while the issuers are, in fact, speculating. Title 15 Section 78u-5 of the United States Code defines a forward-looking statement as including overly optimistic views as to a company's future economic performance, such as revenues or income, plans for future operations, or use of a report written by an outside reviewer. Certain terms or phrases indicate the use by an issuer of forward-looking statements, such as any tense from present to future or similar inflection of words comparable to ""believe"", ""estimate"", ""anticipate"", ""plan"", ""predict"", ""may"", ""hope"", ""can"", ""will"", ""should"", ""expect"", ""intend"", ""is designed to"", ""with the intent"", ""potential"", the negative of these words or such other variations thereon or comparable terminology, may indicate forward-looking statements; however, the absence of these terms or phrases does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

IDGC's Plan of Operations

IDGC is an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act of 2012 and, as a diversified holding company, will focus on emerging and middle market international investment opportunities.

This plan of operations also includes collaboration with ENTI in the commerce of real estate, retail operations, and state-licensed cannabis dispensary and growing operations in California and Oregon as ENTI's doing or in association with IDGC's joint-ventures, Monochrome Corp. and Azure Blockchain Inc.

IDGC's current operations include the conduct of existing respective operations through its totally-held subsidiary, Farallon, Inc. (""Farallon""), and through Prestige Liquids, LLC (""Prestige""), Monochrome Corp. (""Monochrome""), and Azure Blockchain Inc. (""Azure"").

Farallon has been in the business of marketing high-quality coffee beans from Caf La Fortuna and private labeled coffee for Harbour Trading Co. (www.harbourtrading.com), an internet-based chef-selected seafood meal service, that was listed as one of Oprah's Favorite Things on Oprah's Christmas List 2017. Harbour also services various specialty retailers and foodservice operations.

Recently, Farallon delivered a blanket asset purchase agreement with an existing quality packaging equipment company, in Addison, Illinois. That agreement represented Farallon's acquisition of the assets and existing operations at a 10,000 square-foot fully-operational facility, which includes three quality petroleum-based filling lines and one water-based filling line along with a fully-integrated laboratory. The facility also includes and tank storage. The new venture will remain under the Farallon name and Farallon projects its calendar 2018 revenue to be $1.8 million.

Farallon is also engaged in a partnership with Thompson Global Solutions, Inc. (""TGS""). TGS is the owner of the trademarked name and logo for petroleum products marketed under the Extreme brand. Farallon's participation represents an undivided 50% interest in TGS' products. The partnership between Farallon and TGS will utilize both companies' strengths. Farallon will produce and package the products, and TGS will build and maintain the e-Commerce site, as well as to further build the Extreme brand throughout North America.

About Monochrome.

Monochrome is unique and current in today's marketplace. Monochrome's business model incorporates two high-growth markets to create an exciting multi-channel business opportunity within IDGC's distribution network. This includes traditional brick-and-mortar channels as well as by Monochrome's utilization of e-commerce technologies and emerging pipelines to capitalize on the new developments in today's CBD market.

Monochrome's Board of Directors know that the CBD market is driven by health concerns and expanding product awareness. By combining the two under a single business model, Monochrome can expect to meet market demand by introducing a multitude of products. IDGC anticipates that Monochrome's initial development of a cold-brewed CBD product is to be sold in an 8.4 oz. bottle and in a 2.4 oz. ""shot size"" and will be a creative step in today's CBD market. Moreover, by Monochrome's exploitation of its products, it expects to attract partners for other products in the hemp and CBD channels that will expand as Monochrome's product development increases. Monochrome's Board of Directors estimate that by the company's utilization of traditional and contemporary delivery methods (through its partners, such as beverage and food distributors), will best serve its development. Monochrome's use of non-traditional distribution and delivery channels (such as brokers who will drive business in health care, universities, and health awareness markets) would be equally impressive.

About Azure.

IDGC's Board of Directors anticipates that Azure will in future leverage its blockchain, real estate, and business assets and relationships. Azure's development, use, and adaptation of blockchain technology is expected to be groundbreaking; principally, because blockchain technology is cryptographically secure, it shares record of transactions, and is updated by a network of computers instead of a central authority. Every transaction within the system will be secure, time-stamped, and linked with previous and subsequent transactions that can be seen by anyone with access to a given blockchain. Moreover, the technology has the potential to be ideal when it comes to simplifying complicated transactions and helping to digitally track physical assets, such as electricity, as they make their way from point A to point B. Azure's management is convinced that this potential makes the technology very attractive to large utilities and scrappy energy startups alike, because blockchain can be used to monitor energy consumption and trading alike. Moreover, Azure will incorporate technology can be used in conjunction with Internet-of-Things technology to better measure electricity usage and collect payments. I can see where this could also help consumers see where electricity is coming from and whether, for instance, it is from a renewable source. I was impressed when you told me that Azure's blockchain technology could be used by large electricity customers to help trade energy between them. It is conceivable that a factory could sell or trade its unused power to another factory that needs it.

About Prestige.

Collaborative Development with ENTI.

In addition to its existing business operations and plan of operations, IDGC has been negotiating with ENTI to collaborate on the acquisition of 15 restaurants in Utah, a hotel in Utah, and the five office buildings in Las Vegas, Nevada. Presently, IDGC and ENTI's Boards of Directors are determining the placement and allocation of the hotel, the restaurants, and the office buildings between the companies.

About ENTI.

ENTI, fictitiously known as Carnegie Investment Corp. and, by and through its current and former subsidiaries, CyberCastingCorp.com, CybAirCorp, Encounter Technologies, Inc. (Florida), Camera Crew Inc., Entertainment Cruises International, Inc., and RTR Media Inc., is a company that formerly specialized in social media, video technology, and online streaming solutions. Since February 2017, ENTI has been in the process of effecting a corporate restructuring program; whereunder, the company is repositioning itself and discontinuing its negligible operations and disposing of its underperforming assets.

As a segment of its restructuring program, the company will be evaluating its position with respect to its joint ventures and other transactions with third-party public company affiliates. ENTI is in the process of filing certain applications and documents with various state and federal regulatory agencies and with self-regulatory agencies in order to seek the necessary approvals and effect its overall restructuring program.

During its restructuring program, the company will be introducing its new website (www.enticolorado.com) to better inform its shareholders, investors, and the public of recent and proposed recent developments; particularly, in respect of its dealings with IDGC.

The overall restructuring program is underway. To that extent, ENTI has been in negotiations with several marijuana dispensaries and grow farms in California, Oregon, and Colorado. ENTI's Board of Directors anticipates that it may partner with IDGreen Corp, an IDGC subsidiary, or with Monochrome.

Capital Requirements by the Issuers.

IDGC and ENTI, including their select respective subsidiaries, will be going to the Crowd for registered funding pursuant to the SEC's Regulation CF. Thereafter, the respective Boards of Directors of IDGC and ENTI anticipate the registration of their securities under the Securities Act of 1933 or by qualifying for an exemption under Regulation A by the end of 2018's first calendar quarter. By utilizing these methods, the companies' boards of directors desire to eliminate debt that is carried on their books and to payoff all mortgages and liens against the companies' properties, business, and assets then to-date. The companies also intend to register all of the common voting and preferred securities then issued and outstanding. It is the intent to effect the foregoing with minimum dilution to the existing shareholders of both companies.

Link to  Amazon launch video released yesterday - The Hygieia Socks Are Now Available On Amazon - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZEy1Ojz0BU&amp;feature=youtu.be

TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE--Umbra Applied Technologies Group (UATG:PK) announces today that it has relocated its corporate domicile from Delaware to Florida in support of its import/export execution strategy.

Chief Executive Officer, Alex Umbra stated, “In keeping with strategic imperatives we will re-domicile the subsidiary UAT from Delaware to Florida.  This change will bolster and ameliorate our import/export apparatus so that we can continue to deliver superior products to our customers at the best possible price”.

The relocation of Umbra Applied Technologies to Florida comes on the heels of a recent change to the corporate structure of the parent company, indicating that the company intends to deliver on its stated intention to up-list to a premium market. When speaking with Chief Financial Officer Thomas Crom he emphasized, “Operating in an increasingly integrated world economy, UAT is positioning itself to better respond to both risk and opportunity while expanding on infrastructure that supports product delivery to the consumer”.  

The company continues to expand its retail footprint with the recent addition of Amazon as a retail platform.  In a recent interview Mr. Umbra stated,” In a volatile macroeconomic environment its important to remain disciplined so as to balance corporate expansion with top line growth. For example, in an M&amp;A strategy, the returns on a spreadsheet may appear appealing but the allure of immediate capital must be tempered with an executable strategy that delivers both revenue and sustainable growth. Being mindful of a structure that focuses on delivering retained earnings rather than focusing on building an impressive operating income helps to create realized growth opportunities.  Corporate governance that structures shareholder value into every decision is critical when strategically repositioning any company especially one that has had to overcome significant obstacles. The last thing you want to have happen is a critical mistake being made, that compromises investor confidence, moments before you pass the finish line. Patience is key”.

The company further indicated that it is currently reviewing multiple acquisition opportunities in furtherance of its previously stated corporate objectives to build on existing technologies and expand its stable of advanced technologies. Additionally, the company is screening multiple candidates to add to its team of highly trained professionals.  The company continues to expand its sales and distribution channels and intends to hire an additional 15 employees by the end of the year.

INCLINE VILLAGE, NEVADA, USA, February 14, 2018 /EINPresswire.com/ -- With over 34 years developing proper horticulture methods, and while working as the administrative
supervisor to create Nativa and Hybrid strains. Rick’s wide range of skills includes both indoor and
outdoor greenhouse operations.
Mr Snelso's experience in organization and administration in a grow operation lay in staffing, training, motivating,
coaching and supervising greenhouse staff. His maintenance of quality assurance, Inventory &amp; Safety
Controls, as well as ensuring strict adherence to company &amp; government standards &amp; regulations is key
to working in a large scale commercial greenhouse.
Rick’s accomplishments include an introduction to upscale medical and recreational cannabis strains.
Innovated growing experimenting with new strains led to a 2006 creation from a new strain from two elite
strains, “Trinity OG Kush” combined with “King Louis” creating “King Triton OG.” Tested at 28% THC,
King Triton OG still holds top seller status today after years of high-level competition and it remains in high demand.
OrgHarvest is a new company in the Nevada recreational Marijuana industry
dedicated to cultivating and the production of Cannabis and Cannabis products.
Home Shopping Latino, Inc. is the parent company of OrgHarvest and is registered in
the State of Delaware. Home Shopping Latino, Inc. trades publicly under the stock
symbol “HSPG” on the Over-the-Counter Market in the USA(OTCIQ). OrgHarvest is a
(dba). The company will submit the necessary information and will file for a symbol
change to “ORGH”.

Existing Common Shareholders
Shareholders of common shares of HSL Inc. do not have to do anything with their
existing shares and will automatically be converted one for one in the new company
OrgHarvest.

The company will file for a name change to OrgHarvest. OrgHarvest will cultivate
high-quality Cannabis and Cannabis plants. The company’s goal is to provide high-quality
Cannabis to retail Marijuana stores, manufacturing and other cultivation facilities in Las Vegas, Reno, and the surrounding
areas.
The company will distribute Cannabis through wholesale transactions to qualified Marijuana Establishments. The company will
operate under stringent quality control processes with all of the Marijuana products to be distributed only after passing all state-required
inspections by independent third-party testing facilities and internal inspections, before being provided to the end users.
The company will seek to obtain a license to operate a Cultivation and Production facility from a private company in the
The state of Nevada.
OrgHarvest will not only strive to provide high-quality Cannabis but produce it in the most sustainable manner. We are poised to
become an industry leader in the Cannabis industry. The target market for OrgHarvest comprises of retail stores, processors, and
the 45 million tourists that visit Las Vegas and Reno/Lake Tahoe each year and adjacent producers interested in local businesses
and farms that create products from the ground up.

Market
Recent research indicates that the Cannabis industry has been growing steadily and rapidly since the passage of laws allowing the
distribution of Marijuana. According to Oakland based Marijuana Angel Investment Network, The ArcView Group (Executive
Summary, 5th Edition), national legal sales for 2016 grew to $6.7 billion from $5 billion in 2015, fueled by explosive growth in adult
use market sales. The growth continues a robust pattern that ArcView estimates will lead to a $22.6 billion market in 2021 at a 27%
compound annual growth rate.
In November 2016, a new set of regulations paved the way for a recreational Marijuana market in Nevada. The State of Nevada
began recreational sales on July 1, 2017, which is expected to register a compound annual growth rate of 42% over the next five
years thus adding up to $433 million in sales annually by 2021. The evolving legal environment combined with changing public
attitudes are all factors contributing to a perfect storm to cultivate industry growth.

Gunpowder Makes a Further Investment into Cryptocurrencies via Bitblox Technologies Inc.



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


Toronto, Ontario, February 20th, 2018 Gunpowder Capital Corp., (CSE: GPC), (CSE: GPC.PR.A), (OTCQB: GNPWF), (Frankfurt: YS6N), (Gunpowder or the Corporation) announced today that it has participated in Bitblox Technologies Inc.s (Bitblox) recently completed second round non-brokered Token Unit financing which was sold directly by Bitblox to accredited investors. Each Token Unit consists of one Token and one common share purchase warrant, which is automatically exerciseable for no additional consideration into one common share of Bitblox immediately prior to a liquidity event of Bitblox. The Token also has the right, on a pro-rata basis, to participate in Bitbloxs profit sharing program, which can reach up to thirty-five percent (35%) of the quarterly profit of Bitblox as determined by Bitbloxs Board of Directors



Gunpowder purchased 1,000,000 Token Units at price of $0.10 CDN per Token Unit for a total commitment of $100,000.00 CDN. BitBlox raised a total of $419,350.00 CDN in its second round.



Mr. Paul Haber Stated: Cryptocurrencies are perhaps the most exciting sector in the markets today and we are extremely pleased in having the opportunity to increase our investment with BitBlox Technologies Inc. While there will continue to be corrections and unnerving gyrations in the cryptocurrency space, despite the recent pullbacks, we at GPC, believe that the future remains bright for cryptocurrencies. The late 1990shype that led to the original dot-com bubble and subsequent burst did not signal the end the internet. At that point we could scarcely imagine what mainstream adoption of the internet would look like; the social and mobile revolutions were still years off. Silicon Valley didn't go anywhere. Instead, it was back and bigger than ever within a decade. We feel the same will hold true for cryptocurrencies.



About Bitblox Technologies Inc.



Bitblox Technologies Inc. is building a high value cryptocurrency enterprise. Bitblox mines cryptocurrencies, such as Ether and ZCash, and offers value-added technology services for the cryptocurrency market, such as crypto-mining proprietary software.



Offering a complete ecosystem of value-creation, Bitblox cryptocurrency mining will provide the basis for an innovative token product that is monetized according to mining profit margins. A percentage of these profits will be invested in the development of a proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technology. Overall, Bitblox takes an approach that enables the company to scale, and respond to changing conditions, within the still-emerging cryptocurrency industry.



Part of a wave of emerging technologies, cryptocurrencies are indivisible from a new virtual economy that is powered in part by smart contract and other AI-based integrations. Cryptocurrency and value mining are central to this new paradigm. Taking a robust and diversified business approach, Bitblox Technologies Inc. is poised to capture value in successive phases as this industry continues to scale.

louied91;1519153558;7yyhe3;;0;;1;"https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/INVU/news/Investview-Starts-the-Year-with-Positive-Cash-Flow?id=183901


SALT LAKE CITY, UT , Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Investview Corporation (INVU) filed its third quarter financials for the period ending December 31st, 2017 while seeing a significant increase in January 2018 billings generating positive cash flow for the first time.  

Investview and its wholly owned subsidiary Wealth Generators reported a net loss of just over $7.1 million-dollars for the 3-month period ending December 31st, 2017. This certainly does not appear to be the type of news one broadcasts through a press release, but we believe the story behind the numbers is important to share as $6.7 million dollars or approximately 92% of that loss can be attributed to stock issuances. This generated a net loss of approximately $402k for the period down from a loss of over $1M for the prior quarter.

These stock issuances are through agreements we have entered that bring additional talent, revenue and products to the company and many are structured to award additional shares based upon revenue growth to the company. This expense is designed to initiate growth and cash flow.

The acquisition of Wealth Generators by Investview Inc. was done to accomplish three goals: 1) arrange for proper company financing, 2) use equity (shares) to acquire additional assets and 3) establish a higher level of transparency through public reporting requirements.

You could say we took our objectives very seriously as we increased our authorized shares, made a series of strategic partnerships, settled or converted outstanding debt while working to increase our revenue.  

In January of 2018 we issued a press release announcing an unaudited estimated increase in gross revenues of 38% (Press Release February 5th, 2018) http://ow.ly/B4zR30iseGw. While we did increase our gross billings by 38% for the prior quarter, what was even more impressive was that our cash flow turned positive for the first time in January of 2018.

William Kosoff, Acting CFO stated, “Having been with the parent company Investview Inc. since 2005 and tirelessly waiting to achieve positive cash flow, I find the accomplishments over the last nine months very impressive and even more reassuring are the positive financial indicators we are beginning to see. We first look for revenue growth, followed by a reduction in losses, then positive cash flow which should ultimately bring us to positive earnings.”

NEW YORK, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCQB:SMME) – Consumers want it. Credit Card Issuers need it.  Now consumer research shows consumers are willing to pay for a new credit card device that helps protect them from fraud.  According to an independent consumer survey commissioned by SmartMetric it was revealed that nearly 2 in 3 credit card users would pay $69.95 for a biometric credit.  The research shows the willingness of consumers to pay for a better more secure credit card with built in-side biometric security is fueled by consumers' concern over fraud.

“What we have created is a paradigm shift in the multi-billion dollar credit card industry.  The SmartMetric developed biometric card has turned the simple credit card into a new high-tech biometric secured device,"" said today SmartMetric’s President &amp; CEO, Chaya Hendrick.

Sales revenues for SmartMetric and Banks, for the new biometric credit card device with only 5 million cards sold, could be in excess of $250 million.  There are over 6 billion Chip Cards that the SmartMetric product is designed for, in use around the world.

From the U.S. CONSUMER PAYMENT STUDY by TSYS, “We know many consumers are concerned about card security. Although those of us in the industry recognize the security features which are in place with cards, we were interested in consumers’ perceptions and how they rank rewards compared to security. We were rather surprised at the response: 74 percent ranked security and fraud protection as their priority, with 26 percent preferring rewards.

Shopping for a New Card: Rewards or Security

26% Ranked #1 for rewards offered

74% Ranked #1 for security and fraud protection"" (1)

""This research is in line with our own independently commissioned research which shows 80% of a major brand's credit card holders are concerned with credit card and identity fraud,"" said today SmartMetric’s President and CEO, Chaya Hendrick.

SmartMetric has developed a fingerprint biometric credit card that uses the card holder's fingerprint to unlock the card as they insert the card into a retail point of sale card reader or ATM.

One of the features of the biometric card developed by SmartMetric is that it has a rechargeable battery inside which in turn allows the card to be used at both standard retail card readers as well as ATM’s.  This is an important product feature since while many credit card users may infrequently use their credit card in an ATM being able to do so is important for card customers.  Discussions with leading card issuing banks has confirmed that they would not be happy issuing a credit card that did not allow their customers to be able to use it in an ATM if they chose to, said Chaya Hendrick.

SmartMetric biometric cards are available to Banks in the United States through SmartMetric’s industry distributor, PROTEC Secure Card. PROTEC Secure Card (PSC), based in New Jersey, has years of experience in the Credit Card industry both in the USA and Latin America. PSC is an established Visa, MasterCard and Discover certified credit card manufacturer that specializes in advanced high-quality credit card production for card issuing Banks in the United States along with Central and Latin America.

WALMART(R) Increases Initial Orders By 44% For Saavy Naturals Everyday Bath Bombs Which Are To Be Distributed To 3,600 Walmart Nationwide Locations   

CHATSWORTH, CA - (NewMediaWire) - February 27, 2018 - Trimax Corporation, Inc. (OTC PINK: TMXN) (the ""Company"") and its wholly owned subsidiary Saavy Naturals Inc., is pleased to announce they have recently received additional purchase orders from Walmart (R) Corporation for the Company's new Saavy Naturals Everyday body care line.

As previously reported, the initial Walmart (R) purchase order called for the purchase of 60,000 Saavy Naturals Everyday Bath Bombs which has now been increased by an additional 26,000 representing a 44% increase to the order which is planned to be distributed to 3,600 Walmart (R) nationwide locations.

Additionally, at the request of Walmart (R) buyers, Saavy Naturals and their exclusive representative U.S. Merchants have created unique one-of-a-kind pallet displays for Saavy Naturals Everyday Handcrafted Bulk Soaps, which are expected to go into approximately 700 additional stores sometime over the next several weeks. Based on ongoing discussions, the Company still anticipates seeing consistent purchase orders from Walmart (R) on a weekly basis beginning March 2018.

The most recent purchase orders received from Walmart (R) is a cumulation of hard work and dedication from all parties involved in addressing the needs of big box retail consumers looking for 100% all-natural healthy alternatives for skin and body care needs.

Hugo Saavedra, CEO of Trimax Corporation and Saavy Naturals Inc., stated, ""Years of hard work has finally brought us to the point where we can finally market ourselves to a broader mass of retail consumers looking for a luxurious quality product that is 100% all natural with excellent price points. We consider this relationship with Walmart (R) substantial to our goal of making Saavy Naturals a household name in the body care industry."" He also stated, ""We will continue to keep shareholders abreast of our developments as they continue.""

Hugo and Debra Saavedra, Saavy Naturals Inc.'s, CEO and President, gained instant popularity for their all-natural body care product line after being spotlighted and appearing on ABC's hit show Shark Tank. The Sharks took an instant liking to Hugo and Debra, their love story, their previous success in the body care industry, and the superior quality of their all-natural product. Hugo and Debra have since increased the company's product line exposure with several highlighted television features on The Home Shopping Network and are currently working on additional television marketing opportunities.

CHICAGO, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Epazz, Inc. (OTC: EPAZ), a leading provider of blockchain cryptocurrency mobile apps and cloud-based business software solutions, announced today that the company will launch a social media and workflow blockchain app using its Proprietary Blockchain Storage technology, which was initially created for the Cordtell project. One of Cordtell’s core features is blockchain storage technology that retrieves data from the blockchain, allowing users to view the data on their mobile devices. This technology was included in the Blockchain Smart Contract provisional patent.

The company believes this is a major opportunity to expand the block storage technology into other blockchain mobile apps, and also believes it will be able to file additional patents for related operations. This core feature is in the final development stage. The company will be releasing this application before the end of the second quarter of 2018.

The company will announce the name of the social media and workflow blockchain app and its website in the future. The business model for the app will be free—for limited uses—for consumers, with ads and in-application purchase options for additional features. For businesses, the app will offer a workflow service, which will have an approval layer to send, receive, and broadcast data within an organization. Businesses will be able to use the workflow service for a monthly fee.

“We are taking features of Cordtell that are in the final stages of development and releasing them into separate applications to monetize the technology. We believe there are several more applications that could be created based on our proprietary technology,” said Shaun Passley, PhD, chairman, and CEO of Epazz, Inc.

About Cordtell (www.cordtell.com)

Cordtell reduces fraud in business transactional contracts. The technology allows for a transactional contract to become a living contract that is tracked and traced; it also verifies that a section of terms within a contract are followed and that all parties of an agreement obey the terms of the contract.

Cordtell, which is under development, automatically verifies signatures, distributes the contract to the blockchain, records the transaction and verifies the terms are being followed via our blockchain apps, which also trace any changes. The technology sends reminders, and tracks payments and delivery of items. The technology will work with Microsoft Word and Google Docs to provide real-time contract edits and updates via version control. The company will primarily market the technology to law firms, health care providers, businesses and governments.

Being pretty new I’m really just trying to analyze how these positions fluctuate. The gambler in me is screaming to try my hand in more of these though. A couple questions for you vets:

1) Is BPMX an anomaly in typical penny stock behavior? If not, how frequently do stocks with aggressive gains like BPMX appear? 

2) How do you guys conduct your DD? Are there specific sites that are better than others at info &amp; predictions? 

3) Have you ever been screwed by not being able to sell due to volume? If so, how best do you recommend avoiding a repeat of that situation?

4) How often does holding long-term work out for penny stock investors? It seems like a lot of people are just playing the gains and losses.

the_restlessartist;1519903115;814k1m;;101;;101;"Hey I'm brand-new here - nice to meet you! As the title says, I just finished Tim Sykes' ""How To Make Millions.""

I like to try to boil things down in my head into an ELIF format and I wanted to do that here and see if this makes sense to some of you more experienced traders here and if I'm getting anything mixed up or if you think you have some more insight to provide. 

Tim's Strategy In a Nutshell (or so I think):

* Each day look at stocks that have the biggest percentage gains

* From that list, look for stocks priced below $10 (usually), that are trading 200,000 to 2 million shares a day (sometimes higher is okay), that have a $10 million to $500 million market cap.

* Avoid any on the list that are biotech, financial, commodity, REITs, or SPACs (usually - there are exceptions, but these are the best practices for most of the time).

* Once you have your list of stocks that fit these criteria, begin searching for news on why they have spiked so much. Focus on tangible news - press releases, articles, analysis, contracts, earnings reports - something that may explain the spike (and that is able to be shared and spread). 

* Go long on the stock if it has ""broken out"" of its multi-day (or multi-month) ""technical resistance"" - go short if it has broken down through technical support. 

* Look to profit 15% to 50% typically - cut losses quickly

* It's a good idea to buy close to market close and sell on market opens - Fridays at market close are great if news can travel over the weekend for people who are looking for ""good plays"" on the following Monday that will cause spikes on Monday morning. 

That's my ""ELIF"" nutshell and I wanted to see if this is a strategy you've heard before or utilize or if it sounds like I'm comprehending it correctly. 

A Little About Me: I've been a direct response copywriter for financial publications (financial advisories like for Motley Fool, Money Map Press, Agora Financial and more). 

But I've never traded . 

Recently - after freelancing for years - I was provided more-or-less an ultimatum. Either I go work in-office in Baltimore  (at one of the offices of these $150 million-plus direct marketing financial advisory publishers) or I don't. But if I don't I will likely stop receiving contract work as they are all putting an emphasis on building in-house teams. 

That would mean my source of income would pretty much dry up (I get paid $10,000 per promotion and 5% royalties per paid sign-up, so it would be a really bad source of income to lose).

I like working from home. I started being a writer in the online marketing space so I could work from home from anywhere.

I live abroad in Thailand (US citizen) and I don't want to move back to the boring US - especially when I'm banging hot Thai bar girls and Swedish backpackers and can work in my boxers. 

I've got three months to make a decision and I've decided my only other viable option is to finally start trading - especially since I have a knowledge of market psychology and how people make fear-greed decisions due to my copywriting background. And I've written and researched so many promotions (and they're 90% research) I feel like I have the really good ability to sniff out news and do the necessary leg work to make smart decisions due to the discipline I cultivated as a copywriter. 

Since January of this year I've made $40,000 and I thought...fuck it. That's literally enough to live on for at least a year or two pretty comfortably even if I put $10,000 into a brokerage account. 

So I'm studying as much as I can, but I want to start trading and learning as soon as I can. 

Hope to be active in here. 

[EDIT]: Okay...seems like this subreddit is full of trolls. I'm off to bed. Will leave this up in the off-chance somebody who is experienced can provide me some insight.

*A Note from hawkstar*
I agree with most of what the author has written below and believe he provides a powerful incite into what goes on behind the screen. During this post he advocates going long with your investments, BUT you must be careful and know the difference between INVESTING and TRADING highly volatile penny-stocks; most of the time with volatile penny-stocks you must get in and take your profit quickly, but if you find a solid company with solid management, business plan, revenues, low debt, and a growing market share then that would be the type of acceptable long term investing the author is referring to.


Author Unkown:
""I was an OTC MM for about 10 years ending in the late 80's. Since then I have been strictly an investor. Since I have not been that up to date in MM rules I will only make statements that I feel fairly confident are still accurate regarding these activities. By and large most MM don't have a clue nor do they care to learn, about the fundamentals of the stocks they trade.

They just try to make orderly markets. When dealing with BB stocks it is very easy for a MM to get trapped into being short in dealing in a fast moving market. Reason being; most of the MM's in this stock are what are called ""wholesalers"" this means they don't have retail brokers ""working"" the stocks.
So they have to rely on what's known as the ""call"" from larger retail houses. If a ""Big"" retail firm like an E-trade calls up a market maker to purchase say 5,000 shares of a stock, they expect to get an ""execution"" from that market maker. If he turns them down, or only gives a partial then the ""Big"" firm will go to another MM.

If this second MM ""fills the order"" then that ""Big"" firm has a moral obligation to continue to give future ""business"" in that stock to that MM who performed (his life blood). This will go on until he ""fails"" to perform and so on.

Contrary to popular opinion the ""Big"" firms Do NOT neccessarily go to the ""Low Offer"" to fill a buy order (Or high bid for a sell). They ""Go"" to who they think will perform to fill the order and expect that MM to ""match"" the ""low offer"" in the case of a buy (bid in the case of a sell). Even though this MM might in fact be the ""high bid"" and not really want to sell any more.
As a wholesaler he must perform or he will get a reputation as a ""non-performer"" with the ""Big"" houses and will cease getting ""calls"" which means he will soon go out of business. I mentioned above that this activity is very significant to BB stocks. I say this because most of the trades in these BB stocks are ""unsolicited"" and are done through discount houses.

With the above groundwork laid, let me try to explain how market makers get short even if they like the Company; Lets say that a stock (shell) has been lying quietly at $.25 bid $.50 offered. A limit order comes into one of the MM's to Buy at $.50 for a thousand shares. Prior to this trade that MM may be ""flat"" (neither long or short any shares). He fills the order and is now short 1,000 shares. He may raise his bid hoping to find a seller to ""flatten"" out his position. But before he realizes it a wave of buyers have come in and cleared out all the $.50 offers. Now the stock is $.50 bid .75 offered. Here comes that ""Big"" firm he just sold the 1,000 shares to at .50 with another bid for 1000 at .75. He makes this print. Now he is short 2,000 at an average of .625. The market keeps moving and now its .75 bid 1.00 offered. Now he has to make a decision.

Just like investors, MM Hate to take a loss. So 9 times out of 10 he will now sell 2000 at 1.00 making him short 4000 but with an average .81. At this time he would love to see a seller at .75 so he can cover his short and make a few bucks.
But instead the market keeps moving up. Now it is 1.00 to 1.25 and here comes the buyer again at 1.25. He doesn't want to lose the call so now he needs to sell 4,000 at 1.25 to keep his break even point above the bid. Now he is short 8,000. Market moves up to 1.25 bid 1.50 offer here comes the buyer now he feels he must sell 8000 here because ""stocks don't go up forever"".

Now he is short 16,000. And so on and so on. If the stock keeps moving up, before he realizes it he could be short 50k or 100k shares (depending how big his bank is). _________________________

Finally the market closes for the day and on paper he may look all right in that his ""break even"" price may be around the closing price. But now he has to figure out how to entice sellers so he can cover this short. It is important to note that if this happened to one MM it has probably happened to most all of them.
Some ways MM's entice sellers; Run the stock up with a ""tight spread"" in a fast market, then ""open"" up the spread to slow down the buying interest. After it has ""cooled off"" for a little while lower the offer below the last trade right after a small piece trades on the offer then tighten the spread so that the sellers feel they can take a ""quick profit"" by ""hitting the bid"" on the tight spread.

Once the selling starts the MM's will walk it down quickly by only making small prints on the way down with the tight spread. Another way is by running the stock up in the morning, averaging up their short then use the above technique to walk it down in the afternoon.

Hopefully after doing this for several days, it will demoralize the buyers. The volume will dry up and the sellers will materialize thinking that the game is over.
Contrary to popular opinion, MM usually Do Not Cover in Fast moving markets either Up or Down if they are short. They Short More. They usually try to cover after the frenzy is out of the market. There are many other techniques they use but the above are the most popular.
This technique works about 9 times out of 10 particularly in a BB market. However that is because 9 out of 10 BB stocks are BS. Remember what I said above. Most MM's don't have a clue as to the value of a Company until they get trapped. If the Company has solid fundementals and a bright future. Then the stock will do very well. And the activity that caused the situation will prove to even help the future stock activity because it created an audience.""



Market Maker's Operating Procedure

The savvy long-term investors never chase stocks up. For the most part that is momentum players and daytraders where most of it or what follows is dumb money. Instead the long-term investors use a couple of simple strategies in order to position themselves. One is to find a stock no one immediately sees has huge potential and accumulate. Long-term investors are not interested in trading against the public mind or the dumb money. That's where the majority of the money can be made but even more can be made if the base of a stock is held extremely strong by investors. However the second is not to doubt the research which is the underlying basis for going long and holding.

More and more investors are winning the game nowadays despite all bashers that float through the Internet that has become part of the game. Floor traders of market makers often watch CNBC, news wires and bulletin boards in order to follow the market during trading session. OTC BB market makers (MMs) don't use fundamental and technical analysis. However, what they do realize is a lot of dumb money does use this newest nitch charting or TA (Technical Analysis) to run a stock either up or down. To the MMs this is like taking candy from a baby. Simply they will paint the tape and use whatever tactic to affect the charting bands. Thus the public and dumb money they will have eating out of their hands. Effectively the MMs can show a strong stock growing weak by manipulating the close price in order to generate selling volume, delaying trading time to manipulate trading activities, or even stalling the ask without honoring orders to hold a stock price.
MMs follow a simple code of business when making a market in a stock especially an OTC BB. That is the level that stocks will seek that yields the most volume. Now this is very important because they make money on the volume buying at the bid and selling at the ask. In other words, by making the market they are buying low and selling high. Now smart money adheres to that rule, so do all the market makers. They could careless whether the stock is at $83 or at $0.23. All they care about is the action thus being able to sell stock at the offer (The high) and buy stock at the bid (The low). To increase their profitability, they make the spread as great as possible on as many shares as they can especially if the volume falls off.

When they have mostly all ""buy"" orders, that's not the price that's going to yield the most volume. They need both buy and sells to get the maximum action. Remember, MMs play the volume. If the volume decreases and there are mostly Buys that become a one way volume, Buy volume. So what they do is let the stock run up to a price where it runs out of steam. They fill all the buy orders there that they can and then comes the pullback one way or another naturally or induced. During the pull back they can buy tons of shares and flip them to those averaging down or trying to catch the bounce. At some price, the stock will be relatively stable and yield the most volume. Now that is the average price you will see
The average price is the point where a stock seeks a level where MMs can profit on the most volume. So during the day that is the price that MMs and momentum/day traders want to see the stock at. Why? Because they know the public and dumb money was chasing the price thing up. Most of the time, the MMs love a flurry of Market Orders which is a dead sign of an artificial run or momentum. Merely it is money in the bank for them. Most get hung in a momentum or day trade or by the tactics of Market makers, who are in the business to screw the public every chance they get and the NASD is not going to do anything about it. They are merely making the market liquid is there reasoning.

The market makers have created an added complication to the OTCBB's chaos of the already volatile intra-day price movements created by dumb money, momentum and day-traders. MMs can not relate to long-term holders in the OTC BB. That makes absolutely no sense what so ever. They feel a large percentage of trades in the OTC BB market consist of short-term or day-trades, MMs merely view the barrage of buy and sell orders as relatively neutral to the market. How they figure it is when the average dumb money buys shares in a company, the MMs feel or rather know with some certainty it is very likely that dumb money will want to sell back those shares relatively quick on the slightest drop.

Now somewhat comfortable with this logic the MMs merely short sells into the buying and attempts to take the stock down in an effort to ""shake out"" the weak. Since it is tough to know for sure whether a move is the beginning of a trend, or a routine shake out, this type of deception works quite well for the MMs. What the long-termers do to a stock is surprise the MMs because instead of falling the shorting has no effect and the price goes up. Now that puts the MM at selling low through shorting and thus having to buy high in order to cover.
Boy, when this happens, the MMs are not very happy campers. The investors and traders are supposed to be doing that no them. Now it becomes time to pull out every trick and tactic in the book in order to attempt to get a Bear Raid at every dollar mark or percent from where the stock started. Could be a penny in smaller priced securities? What MMs do is give you a chance to make a small amount of money for your momentum and day trading style by shorting it at these levels and trying to get a bear raid each time. Each failure is compounding the MMs short position so they let it go to the next level. Now come more deliberate tactics MMs use to coerce Bear Raid or panic selling.

Once the MM is caught short and the strength of the buy is overpowering the MM will want to cover his short position. So the MMs call up one of his friendly MMs and says some like ""the weather is sure rough today."" The MM along with the other ""friendly MM initiates a down tick about the same time. Now this can also be done with a certain amount of shares such as an infamous 100 shares flag. This down tick gives the illusion of weakness designed to hopefully begin the bear raid of selling. The fickle, fearful, day trader, momentum and short term begin to sell out allowing the MM to cover his short position at lower prices. They will move it down quickly to get it to a price of least financial damage. Problem they have is long-term investors in the OTC BB. They start accumulating and buying comes flying in when they take it too far thus the MMs took it to the point of volume again and not only investors the other MMs step in the make money on the spread.

Alas the poor MM does not get to cover. Now comes various tactics like stalling, boxing, or even locking the Bid and Ask for a while.

Of course, MMs aggressively deny any sort of collusion designed to fix quotes or spreads, but a recent SEC investigation tells another story.

MMs have a vast resource of tactics and it would take probably more than my lifetime to figure them all out.

So how do investors somehow manage to overcome the obvious deception in OTCBB arena? One answer is indirection trading style by going long which the MMs do not expect. In the war between investors and public companies on the OTC BB vs the MMs, if the MMs have all the advantages due to position or other factors, direct confrontation such as momentum or day trading hitting the stock is a definite death sentence.

However, an indirect approach tends to weaken the path of least resistance before slowly overcoming it. The most effective way is long-term investors slowly accumulating and holding thus drawing the MMs out of its defenses making them as naked as their short position. This is war so this slow accumulation and holding for the long term easily achieves the desired effect to force MMs to cover and knock off the tactics or bury themselves deeper.

The MMs when caught will especially use every trick and tactic in the book to get a Bear Raid thus playing on the individual fear of most people. The MMs feel they have information and position advantages over the investors as long as the holding of the stock is in weak hands or short term holders. Since they are OTC BB MMs who believe all OTCBB companies are not worth investing and management is ineffective regardless what is happening within the company.Furthermore, MMs know they are in the position to impose a great deal of influence in OTC BB stocks trading when it suits their needs.

This inherent power of position enables the MMs to move the markets at any time up or down. As a result, the only way to draw them out of their favorable position is going long. Now this does not mean just any company but to effectively nail the MMs, Longs must find the great company on the floor and accumulate long before the MM tactics and games begin.

[deleted];1520287777;829uga;Question;0;;0;[deleted];;ISBG Seems sketchy, thoughts?;
Jaynki;1520288924;829zzg;;0;;3;"Hello everyone,

First of all, i don't have any knowledge concerning technical analysis and/or penny stocks trading. 

Back in december, i have heard about a micro-cap and i have decided to take a look.

LeanLife Health (formery LeenLife Pharma) is a company that have a top quality omega 3 product.

They have just recently started operations.

They ordered a BioCube (private company) to produce their product and they have an exclusive agreement with them for the next ten years.

January 25th, they made a news release that RD Heritage would market and sell their product. The deal seemed nice and it was stated in their news release that they expected their first purchase order in the next 30 days.

February 1, they made a news release stating that they've rented and renovated ~350 000 sq. feet of industrial space in Vancouver. They've also stated that they had acquired lab and testing material and that the BioCube was close to being delivered.

Their technology seems to be low-cost and if they could have some revenue, i don't think it will be long before they are profitable.

In an MD&amp;A released March 1st, they suggest that they hired two sales representative in Poland and that it resulted into sales agreement to be acted upon. (The CEO seems to have a lot of connection in Poland.). It is also stated that they will lack liquidity for their operations and that they plan to raise via private financing.

When i've saw that news release that RD Heritage, i jumped aboard and invested at an average of 0,36c.

I made a lot of money out of weedstocks and wanted to go hard on a promising (i believe) penny stock. 

I expect and believe they could announce sales contract soon as operation are starting. 

They recently changed their name (mid january, from LeenLife Pharma to LeanLife Health.)

New website will be up soon. 

www.leanlifehealth.com

The graph seems to show support at like 0,10c. They gaved RD Heritage warrant of 0,40c(expiring 2020) and they have granted director stock option at 0,25c(expiring 2020) back in december.

I know that a lot of penny stocks are price-manipulated, fraudulent, etc.. LLP stocks went from daily volume of ~200 000, even up to 1M, from november to february and it is sidelining at ~0,30c since one month.

I am starting to be a bit worried with my investment(i went a bit too hard with such a speculative stock) but i am still confident a sales contract announcement could give a nice bump to share price and i have looked back at everything with a skeptical eyes. RD Heritage website is ugly and i am afraid it is a scam, and a website made with wix.com, seems odd. LeenLife Pharma first website gave me that vibe too but i feel more confident with the name change, the new website and the beginning of operation.

Can some more experimented traders share their opinions or insight about what you see in this company? I plan on holding right now.

GlobeNewswire•March 6, 2018
BEVERLY HILLS, CA, March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTC: RCHA), is a Biopharmaceutical Company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies in oncology using its study drug RP-323 (TPA). Multiple clinical studies have shown a significant increase in WBCs in patients with solid tumors who suffered from low WBCs counts, and the studies show that RP-323 plays a major part in the developmental processes that are vital to many patients’ treatment and recovery.

""In one of the studies with 52 patients, all but one of the patients treated with an infusion of our drug TPA increased the number of WBCs, some significantly.  We know that WBCs are key to fighting disease and are vital to many patients' treatment and recovery,"" said Rich Pharmaceuticals CEO Ben Chang. 

“Physicians become concerned if the number of WBCs fall or rise out of the healthy range since they help fight infections by attacking bacteria, viruses, and germs.  Having a higher or lower number of WBCs may be an indication of an underlying condition,” explained Mr. Chang. “The ability to regulate WBC is a key element in immunotherapy.  Immunotherapy is the treatment that stimulates your body’s own immune system to help fight cancer.”

About Rich Pharmaceuticals:

Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage Biopharmaceutical Company focused on developing innovative therapies in oncology, with initial concentration in treating Acute Myelocytic Leukemia (AML), Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) and other blood related diseases.

1. The world’s biggest privacy regulation GDPR goes into affect May 25 2018. 

If there is one thing that people know about the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) it’s that GDPR fines (administrative fines) can go up to 20 million Euros or 4 percent of annual global (note global!) turnover, whichever of both is highest. 
https://www.i-scoop.eu/gdpr/gdpr-fines-guidelines-application-penalties/ 

Figure this one out: Just shy of 100 percent of U.S.-based privacy professionals believe the importance and complexity of managing privacy in their organizations is increasing. 

Similar numbers (97 percent!) acknowledge they will increase their investment in managing privacy. Yet fully 61 percent of these same professionals acknowledge they have done little to prepare for the coming of the world’s biggest privacy regulation, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. What’s more, 99 percent admit to needing additional help in preparing for the GDPR.

2. DATA443 (OTCPK: LDSR) ClassiDocs Wins Numerous Industry Awards – GDPR 100 days awayPress Release | 02/13/2018 

RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. is pleased to announce that its recent acquisition – ClassiDocs - has won prestigious industry awards for GDPR Compliance, Data Classification and Governance in the 2018 Cybersecurity Excellence Awards. 

Gold Winner 

“This is validation for the whole team. The volume of support we received from the community surprised us but does match the feedback we get from clients and partners – that the ClassiDocs product set is an on-point technology that facilitates many requirements of the upcoming GDPR legislation and provides for a unique and feature-rich Data Classification and Governance solution,” stated Mr. Remillard, CEO of DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. today. 

“Congratulations to DATA443’s product team for being recognized as the gold winner in three categories: Data Classification and Data Governance. The GDPR category – a new one this year – had the ClassiDocs GDPREngine product place first also as a gold winner,” said Holger Schulze, CEO of Cybersecurity Insiders and founder of the 400,000-member Information Security Community on LinkedIn that organizes the awards program. ""With over 400 entries in more than 70 categories, the 2018 awards are highly competitive and all winners truly reflect the very best in today's cybersecurity industry."" 

“We have worked very hard on our GDPR functions – adding capabilities that are grounded in true use cases and deliver immediate value to the client. Our forthcoming GDPREngine technology delivered in a SaaS model delivers GDPR compliance capabilities faster and with much less total cost of ownership for clients,” added Mr. Remillard. “We will be making this officially available for beta clients in the coming month – the GDPR Deadline is fast approaching – 100 days exactly today. We are seeing increased demand worldwide for capabilities – matching our initial analysis that GDPR applies more broadly than just the European Union.”

About DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. 
DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. (OTCPK:LDSR) (https://www.data443.com) is a technology company that is actively developing and acquiring cyber-security products &amp; service offerings that are central to blockchain, cyber data security, GDPR, compliance and governance capabilities. The Company develops its own technologies and has an active acquisitions program in place. 



3. A majority of companies plan to use external firms to accelerate their GDPR preparation 
Because GDPR’s requirements are deep and complex, preparing for the new regulation requires buy-in and support from across an organization, including in areas are not used to dealing with privacy issues. In response, many companies plan to use external firms to help with their preparation. 

Among executives polled in this survey, 69% said they plan to use a technology firm to help with their preparations, 62% plan to hire a consulting firm, and 46% plan to hire a law firm. Roughly two-thirds of larger companies – those with greater than $500 million in revenues – say they will hire a consulting firm. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html






4. US companies lead their UK and Japanese counterparts in making steady progress in GDPR readiness 
With GDPR set to go into effect in May 2018, 11% of executives surveyed said their companies have now finished operationalized preparations. This tally is almost double the 6% that were finished last year. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the number of companies that have yet to even begin preparations has shrunk dramatically, from 23% last fall to just 7% in the most recent survey. 

Significant gaps remain, however. Of the companies surveyed, 36% said they have just started the assessment process, meaning their journey toward GDPR readiness has just begun. As a result, these organizations risk not being fully compliant by the May 2018 deadline, facing regulator fines, litigation costs, and lost contract opportunities in Europe. 

Compared to the UK and Japan, companies in the US have made the most progress toward compliance. Almost a quarter, or 22%, of US companies surveyed say they have finished GDPR preparations, compared to just 8% of UK companies and 2% of Japanese companies. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html 





Japanese companies plan to spend more to catch up to their US and UK peers 
US companies are further along in cross-functional areas than their counterparts in UK and Japan. Japanese companies, in particular, lag behind in several key areas, including data-lifecycle management, for which roughly one-in-five Japanese companies surveyed reported they have finalized implementation of preparations. Japanese companies are similarly behind in areas such as training, cross-border data strategy, and privacy incident management. 

Although Japanese executives report they are behind in several key GDPR preparation areas, they expect to spend significant amounts of money to catch up. The survey found 77% of Japanese companies plan to spend at least $1 million on GDPR projects, compared to 62% of US companies, and just 43% of UK companies.

5. Tech Giants Brace for Europe’s New Data Privacy Rules 

With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley’s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules. 

“Every person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,” said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. “G.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.” 
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html


EU GDPR – new rules, wider reach – the biggest change to data protection laws in 20 years 

End of implementation period 

After four years of negotiation, GDPR was finally adopted on 27 April 2016. It comes into effect after a two-year implementation period. One law firm has described it as the “most ground-breaking piece of EU legislation in the digital era” – and with good reason. It will make businesses more accountable for data privacy compliance and offers individuals extra rights and more control over their personal data. 

The GDPR does not need to be transposed into local law in each EU member state. This is a directly-effective regulation which will be immediately effective across the 28 countries, aiming to remove inconsistencies in how the data protection law is applied in Europe.

N8 identity inc is partners with ORACLE and IBM who in turn deploy their partner's solutions (ClassiDocs) to thousands of businesses including Allstate, Metlife, TD Ameritrade, this is just a few. 

checkout their clients page on their website! 

So basically, N8 Identity inc chooses the best of the best solutions, and the best of the best companies go to them for their solutions, and here is proof that the CEO of N8 identity supports Jason and ClassiDocs. I am not by any means saying Metlife, Allstate and TD Ameritrade will be ClassiDocs customers, however I am saying that when they look for GDPR, they will go to N8 Identity for help. ClassiDocs may not get chosen but it will have potential access to thousands of businesses. 

and last of all, here is a link to an invite FROM JAY ODONNEL AND JASON REMILLARD TOGETHER inviting people to demo ClassiDocs.. Further proof of a good relationship and support for ClassiDocs from one of the world's largest solution providers with the a very large list of clients.

New York, NY , March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OpenVision Labs, a New York-based digital communications and live-streaming solutions provider, recently launched its OpenVision Media Player platform with pay-per-view functionality to support an independent film making initiative headed by “Suicide Squad”, actor, Adam Beach; releasing “The Watchman’s Canoe”

In partnership with accomplished actor, Adam Beach, of “Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit”, “Joe Dirt,” and “Windtalkers,” among many others, OpenVision Labs has released Mr. Beach’s first independent film on its proprietary, pay-per-view, OpenVision Media Player.

“We are very excited to have partnered with the innovative team at OpenVision Labs to leverage their new platform to distribute the first movie of this initiative,” said Adam Beach, “This is a huge step for independent and disenfranchised filmmakers.  This platform not only gives these film makers the ability to reach larger audiences, but, allows these cinematic artists the ability to take control of the distribution of their art.  That is very exciting to us; to be part of that paradigm shift.”

While the platform is in limited release right now, OpenVision Labs (a startup leveraging the Digital Arts Media Network, Inc. (OTC PINK:DATI) Public Accelerator-Incubator platform) will soon open up its media player to other independent film creators – with a view toward musicians, artists, and other content creators in the future. This will allow artists to get their content out and their voices heard by much larger audiences, and within their own control.  This means content creators can more effectively monetize their work and gain support for future projects; supported by their fan base.

LAS VEGAS, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE--Adama Technologies Corp. (ADAC) announced today that they are on pace to set a new monthly sales record having already received over One Hundred Twenty Thousand dollars in the month of March in revenue from US Military Defense Contracts.   This revenue stems from a freshly completed order of links that are used in the landing gear components of the F16 and F15 fighter jets.  The company is anticipating another Ninety Thousand Dollars from the balance of this same contract later this month

Harold Tanner, President of Adama Technologies, stated, ""These revenue figures are extremely exciting, but these numbers only represent one of our six government defense contracts currently in production and we have three additional commercial contracts in production as well.  As we continue to ship these orders, our revenues are going to continue to climb.”

Adama’s contracts are manufactured in Richmond, Utah in a 10,000 square foot facility complete with an inhouse engineering team.  Mr. Tanner continued, “We are very proud to carry the label, “Made in the USA”.  Alpine Industries has been in business for 50 years and we have been a company that values our customers and manufactures the very best parts for each contract and client we work with.  Adama is currently experiencing a season of unprecedented growth, but we have not lost our acclaimed attention-to-detail that allows us to make every job a success.”

The Company has continued to be focused on growing its current revenue streams within Alpine Industries, a government defense contractor, as well creating new revenue streams through the development of the Company’s new, online retail outlet, CRYX, and also utilizing the Company’s technology platforms to create additional verticals and revenue centers for the Company.

And it sounds like we don't know what we're doing. And, at least in my case, I really didn't know. But it was what I could afford at the time.

I didn't make much at the time. I had a job that paid not much over minimum wage. But I worked smart. I saved smart. Started saving money little by little.

I never made much money on penny stocks. I think my highest net income from penny stocks was around $500 from an initial investment of $90.

But. Oh and its a big but. I learned so very much from researching stocks that I carry that knowledge into today. I have a very decent paying job that allows me to actually purchase non-sub $1 stocks after careful research that I learned from penny stock world.

I hope that people don't just 100% invest from this sub solely based on something someone posted to get a little boost, but because they did their education dive. Because they did their research and understood what was in store for the company they invested in.

For those who are posting because you did your due diligence, cheers to you. For those who are successful because of folks who allowed you the info to research, cheers to you.

If there is one thing that people know about the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) it’s that GDPR fines (administrative fines) can go up to 20 million Euros or 4 percent of annual global (note global!) turnover, whichever of both is highest. 
https://www.i-scoop.eu/gdpr/gdpr-fines-guidelines-application-penalties/ 

Figure this one out: Just shy of 100 percent of U.S.-based privacy professionals believe the importance and complexity of managing privacy in their organizations is increasing. 

Similar numbers (97 percent!) acknowledge they will increase their investment in managing privacy. Yet fully 61 percent of these same professionals acknowledge they have done little to prepare for the coming of the world’s biggest privacy regulation, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. What’s more, 99 percent admit to needing additional help in preparing for the GDPR.

2. DATA443 (OTCPK: LDSR) ClassiDocs Wins Numerous Industry Awards – GDPR 100 days awayPress Release | 02/13/2018 

RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. is pleased to announce that its recent acquisition – ClassiDocs - has won prestigious industry awards for GDPR Compliance, Data Classification and Governance in the 2018 Cybersecurity Excellence Awards. 

Gold Winner 

“This is validation for the whole team. The volume of support we received from the community surprised us but does match the feedback we get from clients and partners – that the ClassiDocs product set is an on-point technology that facilitates many requirements of the upcoming GDPR legislation and provides for a unique and feature-rich Data Classification and Governance solution,” stated Mr. Remillard, CEO of DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. today. 

“Congratulations to DATA443’s product team for being recognized as the gold winner in three categories: Data Classification and Data Governance. The GDPR category – a new one this year – had the ClassiDocs GDPREngine product place first also as a gold winner,” said Holger Schulze, CEO of Cybersecurity Insiders and founder of the 400,000-member Information Security Community on LinkedIn that organizes the awards program. ""With over 400 entries in more than 70 categories, the 2018 awards are highly competitive and all winners truly reflect the very best in today's cybersecurity industry."" 

“We have worked very hard on our GDPR functions – adding capabilities that are grounded in true use cases and deliver immediate value to the client. Our forthcoming GDPREngine technology delivered in a SaaS model delivers GDPR compliance capabilities faster and with much less total cost of ownership for clients,” added Mr. Remillard. “We will be making this officially available for beta clients in the coming month – the GDPR Deadline is fast approaching – 100 days exactly today. We are seeing increased demand worldwide for capabilities – matching our initial analysis that GDPR applies more broadly than just the European Union.”

DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc.

The Company develops its own technologies and has an active acquisitions program in place. 



3. A majority of companies plan to use external firms to accelerate their GDPR preparation 
Because GDPR’s requirements are deep and complex, preparing for the new regulation requires buy-in and support from across an organization, including in areas are not used to dealing with privacy issues. In response, many companies plan to use external firms to help with their preparation. 

Among executives polled in this survey, 69% said they plan to use a technology firm to help with their preparations, 62% plan to hire a consulting firm, and 46% plan to hire a law firm. Roughly two-thirds of larger companies – those with greater than $500 million in revenues – say they will hire a consulting firm.

4. US companies lead their UK and Japanese counterparts in making steady progress in GDPR readiness 
With GDPR set to go into effect in May 2018, 11% of executives surveyed said their companies have now finished operationalized preparations. This tally is almost double the 6% that were finished last year. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the number of companies that have yet to even begin preparations has shrunk dramatically, from 23% last fall to just 7% in the most recent survey. 

Significant gaps remain, however. Of the companies surveyed, 36% said they have just started the assessment process, meaning their journey toward GDPR readiness has just begun. As a result, these organizations risk not being fully compliant by the May 2018 deadline, facing regulator fines, litigation costs, and lost contract opportunities in Europe. 

Compared to the UK and Japan, companies in the US have made the most progress toward compliance. Almost a quarter, or 22%, of US companies surveyed say they have finished GDPR preparations, compared to just 8% of UK companies and 2% of Japanese companies. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html 





Japanese companies plan to spend more to catch up to their US and UK peers 
US companies are further along in cross-functional areas than their counterparts in UK and Japan. Japanese companies, in particular, lag behind in several key areas, including data-lifecycle management, for which roughly one-in-five Japanese companies surveyed reported they have finalized implementation of preparations. Japanese companies are similarly behind in areas such as training, cross-border data strategy, and privacy incident management. 

Although Japanese executives report they are behind in several key GDPR preparation areas, they expect to spend significant amounts of money to catch up. The survey found 77% of Japanese companies plan to spend at least $1 million on GDPR projects, compared to 62% of US companies, and just 43% of UK companies.

5. Tech Giants Brace for Europe’s New Data Privacy Rules 

With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley’s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules. 

“Every person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,” said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. “G.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.” 
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html


EU GDPR – new rules, wider reach – the biggest change to data protection laws in 20 years 

End of implementation period 

After four years of negotiation, GDPR was finally adopted on 27 April 2016. It comes into effect after a two-year implementation period. One law firm has described it as the “most ground-breaking piece of EU legislation in the digital era” – and with good reason. It will make businesses more accountable for data privacy compliance and offers individuals extra rights and more control over their personal data. 

The GDPR does not need to be transposed into local law in each EU member state. This is a directly-effective regulation which will be immediately effective across the 28 countries, aiming to remove inconsistencies in how the data protection law is applied in Europe.

N8 identity inc is partners with ORACLE and IBM who in turn deploy their partner's solutions (ClassiDocs) to thousands of businesses including Allstate, Metlife, TD Ameritrade, this is just a few. 

checkout their clients page on their website! 

So basically, N8 Identity inc chooses the best of the best solutions, and the best of the best companies go to them for their solutions, and here is proof that the CEO of N8 identity supports Jason and ClassiDocs. I am not by any means saying Metlife, Allstate and TD Ameritrade will be ClassiDocs customers, however I am saying that when they look for GDPR, they will go to N8 Identity for help. ClassiDocs may not get chosen but it will have potential access to thousands of businesses. 

and last of all, here is a link to an invite FROM JAY ODONNEL AND JASON REMILLARD TOGETHER inviting people to demo ClassiDocs.. Further proof of a good relationship and support for ClassiDocs from one of the world's largest solution providers with the a very large list of clients.

IGOSODAMNHAM;1520602831;836qd9;;38;;49;"I have seen this for a long time, and new traders always gravitate towards Bio stocks, but not the legit ones, the shitty Bioturds. They see these tiny stocks get some type of news and have crazy gains so they are in search of the next one. They think they are way smarter than they are, they fall for all the hype and won't listen to anyone and have this pipe dream of their stock doing well. There is a reason these Bio stocks are this low. They have no cash, their product has flaws or competition, their share structure is disgusting, their board are incompetent at running a company ect...

Lets start with $JAGX. The reason this one moved up so much is as simple as looking at the chart. This thing has been on a down trend for 3 years. It was over $7 in 2015 and went down to .11 (it looks like it touched .01 but I am not sure if that was a darkpool print or a read sell off day so I will ignore that). Off course on some RANDOM NOT PRICED IN news you see a pop, and it only went up to .34ish from .14.

https://imgur.com/OepGTrL

$AKER was a play on the chart. No one gives a shit about this FDA approval. If they get approved you might see small pop, but it will sell off after that. As I posted yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/82y073/aker_a_break_under_60_and_this_falls_to_at_least/)
if this fell below .60 you would see at least .55. It hit .55 on the dot. I expect more sell offs to come still.

https://imgur.com/aoO7QgT

Yesterday was the first time this stock closed under the 13EMA since this run up has started. Bearish. If somehow this can get a bunch of buyers to bump this back up and rebreak out of the wedge... that is Bulls only hope. Another pipe dream.



$BPMX - This was at .01 then above .35. I would never buy this unless it can rebreak .35 with strength. This has run way too far and has so much priced in it's not even funny.


*********************
No one should be playing bio tech stocks unless they are playing off the charts for fast swings/flips.
If you are holding these for FDA approval, sorry, but you are ignorant.
The only reason you should be holding these drugs for approval is if you have a background in Bio and know how to read all the studies/Abstracts and know the ins and outs of the drug world. You should also be able to read all the financials and know the experience of board members.

No, these people who just started trading did not find a Bio gem at pennies that is going to dollars. No, it's not happening.

glitchygal;1520731352;83jlh7;;4;;2;"So I’m looking at the top 50 OTC companies list from 1-18 based on 2017.  Out of those 50 about 12 are “affordable” ARREF, IMMVF, MBAIF, OPCO, EXMGF, CRECF, CORVF, NMKEF, CBGDF, NGPHF, REPR and OMCN

EXMGF interests me a lot because it’s tied in with the same company as JetMF and the management people almost seem more excited about it than jet sometimes.  

ARREF is @ .82 with a target of 1.60

CBGDF is @5.10 and very recently had its target price  raised to 9.13

So I have other things to do now but trying to make up my mind on my favorites.  If anyone has anything to add please do.  ";;Weekend homework 3-10-18;

WonkyWombat321;1520798525;83p6lt;;6;;16;"Chasing the daily pump is a great way to lose your shirt when the group gets bored and moves on to the next one (while you can be a profitable trader from this approach substantially more traders will lose $$). I'm here to recommend a pick of mine which is not trending and doesn't have much interest at this point, but it's potential is considerable and the risk profile is low. This is how you make money in the OTC, patience. 


•	184m float (valued at $404k based on last closing price of .0022)

•	CEO is independently wealthy, well educated, and has not been involved in any prior P&amp;D penny stock scams

•	Financially solid with positive equity and net income (unheard of in penny land at these levels)

•	No dilution in over 2 years (not that it would be needed from a profitable company anyway)

•	Trades very thin (review the chart to see how often this one pops)

•	Company submitted their first filing in 2 years in early February to get CE removed (CE is only in place due to IHUB pump group ran this several months back). This process typically takes 1-2 months and therefore is likely close to fruition.


The price popped after filings hit OTC Markets, but it has since returned to discounted prices. Given management has been quiet for over 2 years I would say it’s safe to assume there is a very good reason they’ve decided to spend $$ to have CE removed and get current again. As always rumors are swirling about the reason behind the filings, I won’t speculate, or try to sell some grand get rich quick expectations, and instead let you make up your own mind.

 Reread the above bullet points and I just ask you to reflect on how many other stocks in the OTC can you name with a float under $500k with such an exceptional risk/reward?

LAS VEGAS, March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Via OTC PR Wire -- Adama Technologies Corp. (OTCPINK:ADAC) announced today that they will bid on an additional $3,000,000 in new government contracts with at least $2,000,000 of that number being for US Military Defense contracts.  The Company detailed their month-of-March bidding plan and strategy and their optimism regarding their ability to win these contracts. 

Harold Tanner, President of Adama Technologies, stated, “Historically we have been very successful in winning these types of contracts simply because we have been building parts for military and defense contracts for a long, long time, over 50 years.  When we are bidding on these contracts, the people we are working with already know us and in many cases have awarded bids to us previously and have seen our work and our ability to perform.  Additionally, we have a great structure and system in place that allows us to keep our costs manageable and therefore our pricing on these contracts is always very competitive.”

The Company also pointed to several cost-cutting strategies that enable their price points to be what they believe are among the best in the country.  Mr. Tanner continued, “We have employed numerous strategies to ensure our prices are always among the best.  By having our own in-house engineering team, we have eliminated a very expensive line item that is often outsourced to a third-party firm.  We also have a very committed labor force who has tremendous experience with these parts so our efficiency and speed are truly remarkable.  Truthfully, there is no substitute for the fact we have been doing this for more than 50 years. Having recently become part of a publicly traded company I am thankful for the opportunity to tell our story to a broader audience.”

The Company reiterated a commitment to growth and continuing to be aggressive in pursuing new sales channels and additional defense contracts.  Mr. Tanner concluded, “We have reached the point within our management, growth, infrastructure and strategic planning where we feel very confident in our ability to scale the business and really be aggressive in bringing in additional contracts and new revenue.  Our team is doing an incredible job of streamlining operations, bringing on reliable subcontractors and phasing in additional third-party operators to allow us to grow at a much faster rate.”

The Company stated that they intend to keep the market readily updated via continued press updates as well as through the Company’s social media channels.  As the bidding process is underway, the Company will continue to seek additional revenue opportunities in their commercial and retail outlets as well and plan to provide a more robust media update regarding their commercial sales division in the upcoming weeks.

Stocks knowone is talking about sitting at or close to yearly lows, preferably with outstanding and authorized share counts under 1b, stocks that pop occasionally and trade very thin, preferably with no dilution. For example:

HCEI - 184m float, CEO owns 80% of remaining OS, profitable operations (albeit very low revenue) with no debt, no dilution in years. Upcoming catalyst: working to get current with recent filings, updates anticipated once current/CE has been removed. I like it because in my opinion it's low risk high reward, I don't need to worry about dilution constantly bringing down share price and there's a reason I consider it undervalued (the upcoming catalyst).

So i figured a few months ago to work online. Plenty of slave labor work available online, but those won't cover my expenses (which i have minimized as much as realistically possible).

I opt into joining Nadex to trade forex (binaries/spreads) and after doing it for a few months, i feel that particular system isn't working for me (what you make is minuscule compare to how much you can lose). Basically, i am not comfortable in needing 2-4 wins to cover 1 lose. It's almost like gambling... and the odds are horrible. Put in $80 to win $20 sounds great, until you lose and realize you need 4 wins to make up that 1 loss. I fully understand the charts, market trends, etc, but its not *if* but *when* you lose... and it hurts.

BOHEMIA, N.Y., March 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Andrea Electronics Corporation (OTCMKTS:ANDR) (Andrea), the pioneer of digital array microphones and noise reduction software that optimizes the performance of voice driven applications, announced today that its DA-250 array microphone is incorporated into the CIMON virtual assistant robot that will operate as part of the ""Horizons"" project on the International Space Station.

This will be the first form of artificial intelligence (AI) on an ISS mission. CIMON is an experiment overseen by Space Administration at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in cooperation with Airbus as the prime contractor as well as IBM, Reichert Design and LMU Munich.

The Airbus' CIMON project will also be presented at the IBM THINK convention in Las Vegas on March 19th – 21st 2018.

CIMON (Crew Interactive Mobile CompanioN) is a mobile and autonomous assistance system designed to aid ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst with his everyday tasks on the International Space Station (ISS). Gerst, a 41 year-old German geophysicist, is scheduled to embark on his second research trip to the ISS as part of expedition 56/57 in late April 2018.

""Airbus required a high performance microphone to operate in this unique user environment. They tested other digital array microphones, but nothing solved the complex audio issues like the Andrea DA-250 DSP array microphone with its industrial NR performance and seamless integration for solving the front end far field voice input for CIMON,"" said Douglas Andrea, CEO of Andrea Electronics Corporation.  

Till Eisenberg, project manager at Airbus Friedrichshafen (Germany), eagerly awaits the mission: ""CIMON is a personal assistant capable of voice and facial recognition. We want to study the psychological effects of long space missions on crew members and try out suitable countermeasures, especially those that reduce stress. We will place special emphasis on data mining and interactions between humans and AI.""

CIMON is a hovering spherical device with internal thrusters to propel itself throughout the ISS cabin.
It has a display, speakers and the virtual assistant function is powered by IBM Watson.

The DA-250 is a small digital signal processing circuit card with stereo microphone sensors.   
The array microphone has state-of-the-art beam forming, noise reduction and acoustic echo cancelation audio input technology and provides robust performance even in noisy server rooms and other fan noise type environments. http://www.andreaelectronics.com/da-250-array-microphone-digital-signal-processor/

An American Innovator
Andrea Electronics sends another first audio system into space.  
Andrea is an American-owned business since 1934. In the 60's the company produced the astronaut audio system for the Project Mercury NASA space program, as well as avionic intercom systems used in F-16 fighter jets and military helicopters. Andrea's microphone array and other advanced digital noise cancellation technologies have been embedded into hundreds of millions of personal computers and other devices. 

The DA-250 Digital Array Microphone line is a standalone advanced microphone solution for OEMs and is among the latest innovations from Andrea Electronics.

I thought to revive the old project I started some time ago. If you are following me from the beginning (when I used to have my old youtube account) you should know that I really like to use Google data to find information on searched keywords, keyword terms and associated volume. 

As well I like to use Google search trends which can very precisely forecast the mania and bubbles while Google aggregates the mass hysteria that is being typed into Google search box, like in example ""bitcoin"" or ""marijuana stocks"" etc..

So just to make this description shorter, I will tell the whole idea behind this video series: I used Google keyword data to find penny stock related search terms. Downloaded all data which I will base my future content with.

$BYOC CEO George Pursglove's BIO: 
Mr. Pursglove is an accomplished entrepreneur with over 30 years of start-up and early-stage business development experience. Most prominently, Mr. Pursglove has founded or co-founded four businesses that have created significant value for their investors. From 1997 to 2002, he was founder and CEO of USA Service Systems, a company which provides merchandising and assembly solutions to major retailers (and which continues today as National Product Services). Prior to that, he was a co-founder and executive of both office supply retailer HQ Office Supplies (which was acquired by Staples) and home improvement warehouse retailer HomeClub (which was acquired by Zayre Corp.). Most recently prior to leading APAI, he served as co-founder, CEO and director of BOOMj.com, an early player in social networking and ecommerce. In addition to his extensive executive experience, he has served as investor, director and/or consultant. Major experiences include seed round investments in All American SportsClub, Inc., and shopping.com. and serving on the board of directors of Choices Entertainment (NASDAQ) and Sims Communication Inc. (NASDAQ). 

Some more basic DD: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lGl0Zjjen8lQw4bJDKTZpHQ3JFVEGBFT6bXYsqGBLWo/edit?usp=sharing

There is another aspect to Boustead...they were the lead underwriter for the private placement, the 10 million dollars that boustead used to acqurire service800 and likely a few other companies. 

If George, Boustead, and Maxim convince companies bringing in significantly more revenue than 10 million dollars to merge their company for a couple million up front, that likely means the companies see the great ability for growth.

$UAVS is an agricultural drone company partenered with a software company (NASDAQ: RAVN) that enables the drone-collected data to direct the application of fertilizers/pesticides into fields with precision agriculture.

From what I've seen there is almost no way to invest in drones in the market with the exception of a military based drone company and several others on foreign markets which makes me think $UAVS will have a good shot in the medium term to build up into a strong long-term.

I was specifically wondering what kind of PR do reverse merges accompany on opening day? Is it reasonable to suspect that $UAVS will announce some big deal pre-bell?

Secondly, ENRJ was pumped and dumped over the past week, where it went up 200% and down 60% where the current price sits... so my logic is, this stock is going to be automatically HEAVILY shorted, easily 20%-40% of shares still need to be covered. It is going to be r/s 25:1 meaning it will have approximately 450k share float. with 80-160k of those shares shorted, so that adds credence to that they'd release PR to flush them out from the get go... on the other hand they may wait to release PR so it gets shorted even heavier

(""Neovasc"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: NVCN) announced today that it has received written notification (the ""Notification Letter"") from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with the minimum market value requirement set forth in Nasdaq Rules for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) requires companies to maintain a minimum market value of US $35 million and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C) provides that a failure to meet the market value requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the market value of the Company for the 30 consecutive business days from February 6, 2018 to March 21, 2018, the Company no longer meets the minimum market value requirement.

The Notification Letter does not impact the Company's listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market at this time. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until September 18, 2018, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). To regain compliance, the Company's market value must exceed US $35 million for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by September 18, 2018, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance.

The Company intends to monitor the market value between now and September 18, 2018 and intends to cure the deficiency within the prescribed grace period. During this time, we expect that the Company's common shares will continue to be listed and trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

The Company's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the Notification Letter.

The Company is also listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Notification Letter does not affect the Company's compliance status with such listing.

- Experimental blood cancer drug is soaring with phase 2 to come

With all of this success in such a short amount of time it is paving way for way more growth than we have already seen. The price is currently held lower than expected due to questioning of if $JNJ wants to procceed with second segment of trail but noted they wanted to review data from trail in 1st quarter of 2018. If they procceed, which may be likely due to recent success, projections see the stock hitting as high as 20$+

Petroselinum_;1522286830;87xe1u;;7;;1;"I bought in at 0.2385 after a month and a half of consistent gains and solid fundamentals (potentially my first mistake). I rode out the first dip to 0.13 but neglected to sell at the second rally to 0.25 (my second mistake).

I'm down about 21% today and about 50% overall. RXMD is currently sitting at 0.14. Can I afford to hope/wait for an uptick to ~0.25-0.30, or am I too late (i.e. the hype's over and I'm screwed)?

The company has good fundamentals, positive cash flow, goals to be up-listed to OTCQX by December 2018, etc. etc. etc... but I was told that strong fundamentals (and the company itself, for that matter) don't mean anything in the OTC world and that the only thing I should trade is the price.

tl;dr bought RXMD pretty high and am considering selling low to cut losses, but I'm also hoping for a rise beyond 0.25 in the near-ish future. Any advice?";49925;Am I bag-holding $RXMD?;

bighdaddie;1522789062;89iixq;;4;;1;"Volume always precedes price. This statement is one of the cardinal beliefs held by most technicians. It first came to my attention in the late 1970s when I read Joe Granville's book New Strategy of Daily Stock Market Timing for Maximum Profit, where he wrote “stocks do not rise in price unless demand exceeds supply. Demand is measured in volume and thus volume must precede price.” (Tom Aspray, Forbes magazine) CRYO averaged about 10,000 shares a day in March. In the last 3 trading days is has averaged 49,648 shares per day. Volume always precedes price. This stock is going higher.
Besides the technical trading, the fundamentals are getting better daily. The international business is growing fast. China is expanding and new licensees coming on soon in Thailand, India, Singapore and Mexico. Stem cells are the future of medicine and even if our FDA moves slow, the rest of the world is not. I am a long term holder of this stock but there is probably a nice trade in it also for those so inclined.  ";50446;"CRYO... ""Volume Always Precedes Price""";

BlackRidge 4.1 Release Introduces New Adaptive Trust Capabilities That Extend Patented First Packet Authentication™ to Endpoints

PR Newswire

RENO, Nev., April 4, 2018

RENO, Nev., April 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BlackRidge Technology International, Inc. (OTCQB: BRTI), a leading provider of next generation cyber defense solutions, announced the general availability of the BlackRidge 4.1 release, introducing new adaptive cyber defense capabilities that extend its patented First Packet Authentication™ technology to software endpoints and enable dynamic adjustment of trust levels to stop today's advanced cyber-attacks and protect against insider threats.

The Release 4.1 centers on advanced capabilities to support authentication of network connections using identity and policy enforcement within a customer environment, a critical capability in today's network environments which are adapting to support both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems. This ensures that only identified and authorized users and devices have access to key systems and applications.

""We are pleased to participate in the testing of BlackRidge's Release 4.1,"" said Bill Thirsk, Vice President of Information Technology and CIO of Marist College. ""Leveraging the College's multi-platform test beds and research environments assists our long-standing research partner, BlackRidge Technology, to develop adaptive security solutions that defend against advanced threats companies and institutions face each day.""

The Release 4.1 enables more flexible deployment, configuration and integration options to more efficiently support the adaptive IT, OT and cloud security needs of BlackRidge customers and partners. These include enhanced product support for endpoints, gateways, virtual server and cloud appliances, identity integration with Microsoft Active Directory®, additional SIEM and analytic integrations for Splunk® Enterprise, IBM QRadar®, and the ELK Stack, adaptive trust levels accessible through a REST API, and an updated management system and console interface. The Release 4.1 also includes FIPS 140-2 validation, allowing BlackRidge to deploy the release to federal agencies, government service providers and other organizations that require products to be certified to meet security standards.

""Our Release 4.1 provides a new level of network security and cyber defense for our customers and partners that addresses the major failure point behind today's advanced threats and cyber-attacks,"" said Bob Graham, BlackRidge Chairman and CEO. ""Customers can now have significantly greater trust in their critical operational services and how they protect sensitive data.""

The BlackRidge 4.1 Release was tested against key customer use cases in Healthcare with a major hospital; by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) for use in the U.S. Department of Defense information networks; in Critical infrastructure and Industrial IoT with the National Renewal Energy Laboratory; with IBM to protect commercial blockchain networks; and with Marist College to protect the management of their network and new cloud services like blockchain.

""This variety of industries, configurations, and deployments supported demonstrates the advanced capabilities of the BlackRidge Adaptive Trust Platform. The BlackRidge 4.1 release supports today's global and evolving businesses that are comprised of legacy, hybrid and new cloud-based applications with many different network configurations and administrative domains,"" said John Hayes, BlackRidge Chief Technology Officer.

Why I'm interested.

i) Liabilities to Assets is good.
ii) Revenue Stream - Actual Stores, I recently visited one in Toronto, Ontario and while the quality of clothing is excellent, most significant problem is inventory, can't get enough!  Very high quality and busy.
iii) Appears to be opening stores in trendy Brooklyn, NY, Venice, Beach and Newport Beach.  Careers page filled with positions.
iv) CEO wants to expand to 1,000,000 RYU members by 2020, and also, on my visit heard 150 stores in N.A. by 2025.
v) Women's magazines love their pants over Lululemon $LULU since they offer a ""TriLayr™ waistband uses layered compression construction that wraps around the waistband."" which prevents riding, and unlike Lululemon, they offer ""Go Commando. Bacteriostatic carbon mesh lined diamond gusset."" which is prevents a cameltoe which the women's magazines love.
vi) Lululemon is quoted in other magazines as being a tired brand since it been popular for over ten years and everyone has it.  They like that $RYU for high quality, and that it's not marketed to yoga crowd, rather Urban Athlete. 
vii) Bieber Group invested $$ in February 2018.
viii) When I research Lululemon competitors only Nike and Adidas come up.  But this must be based on sales and some athletic comparison.  While I don't shop at Lulu, I know many women who have, and it's not a fair comparison.  RYU is offering similar competition in that their stores offer classes and get-togethers, i.e. a culture.  

Anyway, I have a position, curious on your thoughts.  Earnings report will be telling, but I expect the signs of expansion to be held within.";50512;$RYU.V - Respect Your Universe;

In midst of the crypto craze what I have taken from it is the ability to get acclimated to is blockchain technology which is simply a verifiable tracking system that can provide immediate answers. What Block One is doing within the real estate world is using the blockchain to help others get approved for mortgages in half the time it would usually take. If proven to be valuable this kind of progression can cause serious revenue for the company as well a create more opportunities for investors who wish to get involved.;50554;Is Block One Capital BKPPF Making Progress?;

stockenthusiast;1523144449;8am414;;12;;7;"Proof is in the link below.    Longfin went to $140 due to a variety of factors. Bitcoin was just starting to go parabolic, and the news media was starting to compare crypto to the tech bubble. Plus, Longfin represented crypto's entrance into the sector of international trade, Longfin being in the business trade finance. The final factor that caused the parabolic interday move was that longfin had very few shares available to the public, only 10 million, many already held. Dow was also making new all time highs
It was also a recent ipo, so the market still hadn't discovered its price yet. The reason I said go big on LFIN though, was very simple. The price fluctuations were extreme, and when it retraced the full move, how much lower could it have gone? It was due for at least one more quick uptick. Also, Russel 2000 delisted the company due to lack of available shares!!!!!!!! Once it retraced the full move, it was like hitting 77777's on a slot machine. I sold $20 because of the SEC charges being filed, or else I would have held

IamMat;1523208819;8arhj5;;7;;25;"They closed a $3.5 mill financing at .50 cents a few days ago and an Hedge Fund Sabby Management recently purchased about 1.6 million shares.  Stock fell from $3 to $1 because FDA didn't give approval because of a few discrepancies in their cream - they've essentially created a cream for Erectile dysfunction, rather than Viagra.  After they announced a financing round which dropped the stock to .38ish cents.  

A few reasons why I'm bullish here, could turn out quite lucrative.

Firstly management is scheduled to meet with the FDA April 12th to review and resolve the issues - they've claimed to be confident they can move forward.

Financing closed at 50 cents right before this meeting, the stock is currently at ,38 cents.  Folks bought into the 50 cent round rather than open market - this is a very solid sign.  Therefore, currently buying is under the financing round which closed.

Could be huge, currently no dilution and lower volume.  She could pick up fast.  Prior to the FDA issues this was $3, if resolved this could be higher than that - significantly.  We should get an official update April 13th - Roughly.

I have had this for 2 days and may add more depending on what I see. ANDI even has good dip buys and seems to be heading in a good direction with news as a catalyst. 

CELZ is a weird monster but is very volatile and a good play can last 5 minutes. Always watching for a dip but this is very risky. 

TNKE is a very thinly traded stock that has bottomed out and a good chart with a bounce that has started. Hard to get shares but I am holding long in a small position. 

GOPH was a multiday runner. Was. Now it is calming down a bit after its correction but still actually is not a bad company overall. Even then it has dips and isn't too thinly traded if you are looking for gains a little below 10% on a dip. 

DTST seems like it will have a morning spike for the first hour on all hype and then die. I could see this jumping double digits then crashing in the negative by 30% on the day after the first hour. Look at the chart history. 

ANDI is the best easily so far and it will be interesting to watch it all day.

LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 10, 2018 / Applied Biosciences Corp. (OTCQB: APPB), a diversified cannabinoid therapeutics company focused on the medical, bioceutical and pet health industries, announced that it has expanded its product line and launched a hemp-derived CBD product line under the Remedi CBD brand. The products will be sold on Remedi's new website (www.remedishop.com) and in select locations in the U.S.

As the health and wellness market continues to more broadly accept the therapeutic properties and applications of hemp, Applied Biosciences is working closely with doctors, scientists, industry advocates and the general public to ensure each group is receiving accurate, reliable and helpful information regarding the benefits of CBD and our branded line of products.

Applied Biosciences uses organic ingredients and formulations that were created to target common ailments in the health and wellness industry for anyone who is open to trying hemp derived products. The products use industrial hemp as an input to produce high quality CBD for a variety of health and wellness products.

Chris Bridges, President of Applied Biosciences stated, ""According to the Hemp Business Journal (www.hempbizjournal.com), the hemp-derived CBD products market is expected to surpass $450 million by 2020 and we are pleased to be getting involved during the industry's infancy. With the overall CBD market expected to surpass $2.1 billion by 2020, we feel strongly that the legalization and availability of hemp-based products stands to attract the lion's share of the market as hemp-based CBD products overcome the federally imposed hurdles.""

JJ Southard, Vice President of Products at Applied Biosciences Corp. added, ""It is important for consumers to be educated on the differences between hemp-based CBD for multiple reasons including efficacy, legality and safety. Hemp-derived CBDs provide an attractive alternative for people looking to reap the medical benefits of CBD, but who cannot obtain cannabis due to legality issues, or simply do not want to experience the psychoactive effects of THC.""

The new e-store, Remedishop.com, currently offers the Applied Biosciences line of hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) isolate infused gummies, topicals and tinctures. Applied Biosciences is continuing to launch its product lines in select specialty and retail stores.

The organic CBD gummies come in both daytime and nighttime formulations, with the additions of melatonin to facilitate healthy sleep cycles. The all-natural topical CBD lotions for pain and inflammation absorb quickly and are pleasantly scented with blood orange essential oil. The full-spectrum hemp-derived CBD tinctures come in a wide range of strengths to make dosing easier and are offered in peppermint and flavorless varieties.

CBD is the non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in hemp and has been used to treat a variety of medical conditions and ailments. CBD is a natural compound which functions naturally and seamlessly in the body. Cannabinoids are chemical compounds derived from hemp and have shown the ability to stimulate the endocannabinoid system and provide therapeutic relief to many ailments.

jogle8;1523706104;8c717o;;39;;46;So I haven't invested anything into penny stocks yet I've just been analyzing a lot of charts n reading up on strategies and such and I'm just wondering why it seems like all the real money always gets made pre and post market.

Anything most people attach to setups like this?";51301;Opinions on symmetric charts (day candles, 6M);
dirtywiggles;1523761082;8ccjdv;;10;;25;"CELZ actually looks like the most legitimate company here. As a medical person this is an area I know well and the area they are targeting is one which could make a ton of money and their research is showing they are effective. They are trying to replace Humira. I think it bounces Monday and apparently are waiting on FDA approval this month which is why it is moving. 

ANDI is always the most interesting to watch of recent. Always at least one dip buy per day making it an interesting option. I add it back to the watchlist because it seems the falling knife has hit the ground and we can pick it up instead of catching it. I honestly see it testing 0.008 this week and think it bounces off 0.0056-60 which will serve as the basement. The other chance is that it free falls back to 0.0046 but I am 70-30 in favor of rising because there is so much hype and they seem desperate to keep it this way with the video and unveiling of the actual phone. 

SSOF I wish I got in over the weekend. Always a great chart just slowly climbing each day with no end in sight... for now. I think it goes down hard someday this week and that is why this is the only one I watch until midday to see what it is doing. 

GERN is one of my favorite listed companies now. Just seems to go up overnight and is not that bad of a company. I can see this running up on Monday for sure just not as much volatility as others if you want a safer, slower pick. 

Now if you want a wild ride SRUP is the way to go. I carefully set alert limits when it magically drops insane amounts in a couple seconds and then goes back up 10 minutes later to where it was. Always a fun one to snipe. 

FUSZ provides tons of dip buys if you are quick with it. It sees some decent volume like 100s of thousands of dollars traded each day. Another mid day play. 

PAOG is a company awaiting news sometime and is another steady climber. Is a biotech and news makes these wild.

DPW is in the middle of a conference call now probably to announce something or talk about earnings. Low risk play. Good chart. 

CELZ is always one to watch very hard into close. If you are fast you can get some quick profits off of it in the morning spike but watch if it is not obeying. Well as I write this it is going parabolic but I hope it crashes down. Waiting for FDA news so people will be buying it. The CEO just bought 100k worth of shares yesterday so he has to know something.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- APT SYSTEMS, INC. (OTC Pink: APTY), a publicly traded and fully reporting company, is pleased to confirm this week that its subsidiary, Snapt Games, has acquired a relatively new iOS app with established positive cash flow.  It has been a long held goal of Snapt’s management to not only build but also actively acquire games and novelty apps for its portfolio. We anticipate our third in-house game will be released in May.

According to statistics presented by AppAnnie, Q4 in 2017 saw the largest gains for in-app purchases to date, noting over $12 billion spent on the iOS App Store and over $5 billion spent on Google Play. The two stores also saw over 175 billion downloads globally. The significance of these increases in consumer spending proves the mobile application marketplace continues to be a valuable industry. The App Store is poised to reach $139 billion in consumer spending by 2020. With the recent acquisition of its live wallpaper app, Snapt Games has the ability to jumpstart its entrance into one of the largest categories on the App Stores.

“We are going to spend the next two weeks adding to the app’s offerings and restructuring the marketing plan because we believe it will substantially increase the current monthly revenues of $12,950. We are excited to relaunch this app with a new look around May 1st,"" advised Glenda Dowie, CEO.

This transaction further emphasizes Management’s continued effort to grow the potential of its subsidiary companies and move all areas of the operation into positive revenue streams. Our other games, Chick Chick Boom and Hogg Wild continue to enjoy good ratings and we are expanding them to include an option for download revenues, in addition to the income generated from ads.  Watch our twitter feed @APTYsys for more sneak peaks of the new ‘Candy Chef’ game and more details on our great new acquisition.

About APT Systems, Inc.: The Management of APT Systems, Inc. works to deliver stock trading tools like Kencharts and its trading platform Intuitrader with a focus on handheld devices; while also strategically acquiring other compatible financial businesses which demonstrate strong growth potential. We are continuing our diligent search for software products that would enhance our operations while still watching dialogue on the proposed legislation for a Fintech National Banking Charter.  Management recently launched its subsidiaries SNAPT Games, Inc. and RCPS Management, Inc. to further facilitate new products and long-term goals.

Morsyn;1524178906;8diz3n;;0;;1;So I sold this off yesterday and it dipped by 80% today from above .02 to .006. I loaded up and within 15 minutes I was up 200%. Pretty fuckin insane, it's safe to say the float on this is pretty low, apparently there was a reverse split done on the restricted shares only but the details are still being filed out.

TNKE has tanked hard the last few days. Good news is it is still seeing 42 million volume so it is not totally forgotten and is right at its support level pre supernova. Will be watched for recovery and has some news behind it. They keep trying to pump the stock so it may move in the morning. This is a high risk high reward for tomorrow. 

I really wish I held SSOF into yesterday. Turned to be fantastic today. We will see if tomorrow is the turning point where it starts going down or bounces and keeps going. Heavily watched. But they have a history of fraud issues...but the chart. Wonder if it will run anyways. It is the world of penny stocks. The IHUB page makes it look like a risky long. 

ANDI is back to the watchlist as it is proving itself. The only question is if this is a bounce or it will keep falling. It has repeating patterns and mid day plays. Top one for now. 

FUSZ just runs and runs and runs. Not terrible for speed but I do not see an end in sight and do not know why it has run this long. Is another interesting long. Good safe play. 

VATE is recovering and may do a double top. Thing moves like molasses though. But it seems to be a relatively safe long in a small position for a few days. 

HMPQ is an interesting one with some actual business and stability to it. Legalization is getting closer and this has seen some sales already in certain areas. Seeing some serious volume. 

DPW may be recovering. We will see. Overnight watcher for how it finishes. But it is not moving fast at all. 

CELZ is starting to get into questionable territory as there aren't the dip buys anymore and any dip is followed by a continuous dip. Will be watching it but it may not be as good anymore. 

CPXP idk what to make of it. May return to its highs and not on my main radar. 

HMNY is risky as hell but I think it could bounce a bit tomorrow. Emphasis on watch. ";51734;Watchlist for Friday SSOF, ANDI, TNKE, FUSZ, VATE, HMPQ;

TheLastNatives;1524228071;8dn92w;;3;;2;I'm one of the jackoffs that bought into PSID awhile ago and held on to it for shits and giggles. Yesterday they executed a 1:1000 r/s and ticker change to PSIDD. I did my research on reverse splits but this is the first time I've actually experienced one. I now have a notification for an open call totaling the value of all my shares prior to the split. Now my purchasing power is in the negative. Just looking for any insight from people who have experienced reverse splits on triple zero penny stocks. Thank you. ;51759;Reverse split question.;

Blue Diamond Ventures Inc. would become SEC Reporting and Expand Governance

April 20th, 2018 – Blue Diamond Ventures Inc, (OTC PK: BLDV) Chicago, IL.

Cann10 North America Holdings LTD. and Blue Diamond Ventures Inc. consider the benefits of a Merger.

The Alliance will deliver Israeli Cannabis Technology and Innovation from Israel to North America, the partnership with AMS has remained central to this process and when the export from Israel opens up, we will deliver on the original promise to combine forces with AMS as well.”.

A new product line “Cannareet” was released this week in Israel by Cann10, these formulations were created in the Cann10 Labs and represent the latest combination of GMP manufacturing and strict Israeli approvals that will be made available to the Global Market.

About BLDV:
Blue Diamond Ventures, Inc. is a diversified customer centric Management / Holding Company; Blue Diamond Ventures, Inc. seeks opportunities in medical cannabis markets and is driven by critical thinking, the scientific method and compassionate ways to deliver sustainable results

I’m very very HIGH on a current play I’m on GLFH 

It’s somehow been a long term hold. I post on iHub with people there. I’ve never actually pumped this stock up to anyone honestly cause I legitimately like to buy more when I get money since it’s still relatively unknown lmao 

Check it out some time. Just a summary;

-SEC filer - 10k audited from outside agency (always a +) 
-recently removed all convertible debt (shows commitment to shareholders)
- recently acquired a positive revenue streaming company 
- *posted projection for 0.04 EPS and 8 mil revenue at end of year (makes valuation of company by end of year possibly around 0.80 if they hit their mark) 
- CEO actually answers people - I spoke to him once on the phone and he encouraged me to call back any time, but I’m secretly afraid to cause I don’t want to sound like an airhead lol

It’s a relatively new company that to me has made some attempts to get some traction over the years and hasn’t quite been successful until now, but for a new CEO mid/late last year and now they are really starting to generate some good momentum. 

10k filing for 2017 and 8ks from this year (they bought the new company in 18’ so it’s not in the 2017 10k sadly) are online. Give them a read. Share structure is great too with a low float that moves on air. When the next PR drops - 10Q - it will fly. Pretty quiet company and don’t post fluff piece PRs so this is the peace before the storm when they release the 10Q from their first quarter with their newly acquired business they bought in January. 10Q is due mid May so I’m loading up.

Oh and 1 huge thing in the 10k that some people skim over. Galenfeha (GLFH) bought their new business for 1$ and instead sold them shares. Sooooo if the company wants to make this purchase worth it - they will have to do some good work :)

Insiders in the company have 2 series of shares locked up: some at 0.45 and others at 3.50!!!! Sooooo they can’t even sell until we make money lol. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/glfh/stock-chart?intraday=off&amp;timeframe=3m&amp;splits=off&amp;earnings=off&amp;movingaverage=None&amp;lowerstudy=macd&amp;comparison=off&amp;index=&amp;drilldown=off

Chart has been pretty steady as a rock for 3 months + (coincided with when the new CEO took over) it’s recently been coming down a bit but check this out for yourself throughout the day and on L2s. Someone is working hard to short this to collect more shares. It gets painted down in the morning and at the end of the day with weak ass “ask slaps” when someone drops the ask and thus lowers the PPS. I always love the shorts cause they help me get more hands on shares so to each their own

This probably isn’t one that is a sexy flipper day reader type of stock. It’s a steady climber - real company making good moves and this one is stair stepping up in the right direction. 10Q keeps that momentum going and probably very quickly. Shorts are shaking the tree and his is sub .20 now which puts this as a strong buy. Accumulation is steady UP ; RSI is 55. It’s all setting up for a bounce back because the buying pressure is gonna be too heavy to hold it back. Very good alternative and sure thing compared to keeping money in the big boards right now with how volatile they are. 

Long term hold!

0.04$ EPS + 8 mil revenue for rest of the year projection 
Realistic 20 PE put this at 0.80 PPS by end of year if they meet projections (20 PE x 0.04 EPS) 

0.80 PPS trading at 0.17 today - love it. Loading up! Take it all with a grain of salt; thought I’d share

dirtywiggles;1524450999;8e88hf;;26;;15;I think CELZ is always in as a morning spiker. ANDI is coming back a bit even though it is a risky company now. Emphasis on watch. EBIO is a buy as it is hitting major news sources and rated as a buy by Simply Wall Street and Seeking alpha. I expect a large morning spike in EBIO and CELZ. Will be watched all day. FUSZ is running hard but it has to be watched if it will continue or fall. Not touching until mid day. Will update this more. ;51928;Watchlist for Monday CELZ, EBIO, ANDI, FUSZ;

Company continues to get rid of debt and is waiting on trial information. Did not even try to slow down by the end today so it will be fun to see how it works out. Broke huge resistance level. 

GOHE is another multiday OTC runner that just seems to go up. But now we are starting to see that it may start a crack down. Will be interesting to watch tomorrow as it topped out mid day and volume at close was lower. 

PHOT is one of those new hot Marijuana stocks that is taking legs again and just ran today. Do not know what will happen to it but it broke out very well and many run more. 

EBIO is another being if it isn't broke do not fix it. Been on the watchlist a number of days simply because it just moves and the chart is nice. Always seems to be a safe overnight and that is why it was on my overnight watchlist most days. 

VATE I care less about but will watch if it bounces off 0.06 or not which it may and go back up. Slow for now. 

SSOF found some legs and ran once again. I could see it being a dip buy tomorrow. We will see as it may go down mid day. 

DPW is the safest overnight if you can afford 3-5% gains. Just have to be quick and intraday it is garbage. ";52006;Stocks to watch for Tuesday and overnights: CELZ, GOHE, PHOT, EBIO, VATE, SSOF, DPW;

Slow mover intraday. 100% overnight for Wednesday though. Conferences are the new earnings winners and these things are safe plays at conferences especially overnight. Earning winners are garbage now. 

CELZ is the one people think I have a hard on for and I do. So volatile and nothing like it now. Only touch it on dips with limits. Usually a safe overnight if you are fast in the morning. Been alerting this with profits for a while now.

HMNY got a huge upgrade to its projected price. It will likely fly tomorrow as this type of news has spiked other stocks.

itzjamesftw;1524770210;8f5c1y;;6;;7;"I see $AKER talked about here frequently, but I haven't seen anyone talking about the major news of last night. It has yet to be PR'd, but here is a recap:

The Board of Directors voted to terminate Raymond Akers (!) as the Executive Chairman. Richard Carlyte Tarbox was named the interim non-executive chairman. 

Tarbox was formerly the CEO at Alverix when it was bought out.

Upon news of this, the ticker was halted in After Hours and dropped from .48 to .43, before quickly bouncing back to .52. Again, this was just AH, so speculation is whatever there.

Today the Stock opened at .520 and is currently at .548

This is not a pump. This is just an information share.

Though, as an investor, it seems strange that a board of directors would essentially make a ""hostile"" take over move. But then again, since Akers is staying with the company in a new role, how hostile could of it been?  But the fact that Tarbox has worked with acquisitions and mergers before might be the perfect buy the rumor sell the news move.

All I know is the general consensus is that this was a good move for the company and the price is up on it. This is a ticker that was red for nearly two straight weeks, so either it is being pumped back on speculation, or maybe this new Chairman move was made for a specific rumor.

Hopefully the AKER team will PR this, I believe I saw that a StockTwits poster contacted AKER and they said their PR director was out of office until April 30th. That seems incredibly odd to me, but we could be set up for a Friday pump into Monday pre-market news.

Tread lightly, but keep an eye on it.";52193;$AKER Update - Executive Chairman terminated, stock trending upwards;
LucefieD;1524770462;8f5d8d;;9;;2;"So I bought this stock tlnuf the day before it was supposed to go through a ticker change, it ran up from .002 to .005 I sold half and took profits and the next day the ticker change went through... turns out either the transfer agent or the company botched something because the shares ended up remaining locked and didn't switch over. Which is normal for the first few days. Next day the new symbol AXXA was up and trading, but it turns out ALL the shares are being borrowed because the originals haven't been released. So basically the thing is going absolutely bananas cus there are no shares. Might be worth buying in and holding until the old TLNUF shares are released, and then I expect it to correct but until then its gonna go bonkers. Like... it was a penny yesterday and today it's pushing 6 cents! I'm talking OWCP type event here, is it gonna crash eventually? For sure but until then skys the limit. 

Edit: Pushing 7 cents since I wrote this. ";52194;Might want to look into AXXA, unique experience.;

louied91;1524845565;8fcuy1;;0;;1;"https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SDVI/news/Signature-Devices-Launches-Kickstarter-Campaign-for-Knoton-With-a-Functional-Prototype?id=190343

IRVINE, CA, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Signature Devices, Inc. (OTC PINK: SDVI) today announced that it has successfully filed its annual filing on time for 2017. Based in Orange County, the tech firm presented a solution that can help save lives and minimize pain and suffering in case of a school emergency.   Innovo Technology is an engineering company that has designed a portable product, the Knoton, that can be used individually for personal safety or at schools so that it can minimize the impact of any kind of emergency. The Knoton, a crucial Emergency Notification System (ENS), can be operated at schools to minimize the impact of any emergency that takes place on campus.  The company has been developing this solution for the last couple of years. It is a smart device that can be used to trigger warnings and alert students early enough to avoid major injuries and casualties.

The Knoton provides a crucial ENS and acts as a school emergency system that can alert all students, guardians, faculty members, and activate the school’s audible speaker system announcing the emergency loudly. The Knoton will also send an E911 signal (when available) to emergency personnel so that immediate response can take place.  All this happens in an instant. Upon launch the Knoton will have auto-notification based on events such as gunshot sounds using Innovo Technology cloud based AI algorithms to identify such events.

The initial prototype video is on the company’s YouTube channel. The backend support of the project is complete.  Innovo Technology is seeking funding to complete the full prototype and get the Knoton to production. “We are extremely eager to bring this to schools, children, parents, and anyone who is concerned about safety. Your contribution is crucial to us bringing this necessary product to the market,” said Inas Azzam the CEO of Innovo Technology.  “We have all been struck with depressing news about children, students, and teachers experiencing horrific emergencies especially at schools. Schools are meant to be a safe haven for students and children. We want minimize the tragedies that are caused by these emergencies and stem the flow of horrifying daily news by implementing our Knoton solution in every school,” Mr. Azzam went on to say.

The Project is on Kickstarter,  supporters can visit the page and contribute to making their favorite school and facilities safer for their children and educators.  Supporting the campaign, helps get schools equipped with this solution.

The company also plans on announcing its quarterly revenue for Q1 2018 next week with some exciting updates.

dirtywiggle;1525115124;8g1z7a;;18;;5;"Disclaimer: when I say watch I do not mean throw your account in each one. It means these are great plays and charts that can run for a couple hours at most or provide good dips buys. That being said I have been fairly accurate recently and april has been a good month for OTC. One of the best. AXXA and UHLN would have earned some serious money yesterday and always keep CELZ on the watch. 

AXXA is just a wild one I tried to alert yesterday to everyone. Hope people took some serious profits from it. Up 150% writing this at least. Might get in a minute before close. Thing is wild and hard to ignore the chart. I think we see a mini crash before close though. If nothing else a great morning play. 

IFXY is a much more thinly traded one and not the liquidity of the others but I think it will prove to be a good overnight if you do not chase. Watch the close. 

UHLN is a fun one for sure. Got out near the top in mid day from small overnight position. Huge dip buy earlier and I think it runs in the morning for sure but mid day it could be a dumpster fire. 

BRKK is an interesting one for sure. Medium for liquidity and good chart. Somewhat strong recommendation on this. ";52416;Overnight plays for 4/30 AXXA, IFXY, UHLN, BRKK;

VPride1995;1525120244;8g2n8h;;18;;10;"I’ve been following the OMVS story for around a year now, and I tried warning people about it but was ignored. Now the stock is trading at .02-.03. I saw many people arguing it would trade at $1-$5 by this point. 

The merger between OMVS and RAD was likely a scam perpetrated by SR and RAD. Early last year OMVS saw a spike in its stock price. This temporarily saved the company from being diluted into oblivion by convertible bonds. 

Say you have a $1000 bond that is converted at a 50% discount. If your shares are trading at .01 then you must issue 200K shares upon conversion. If your shares trade at .2 you must only issue 10K shares. 

The temporary hype around OMVS saved it from massive dilution. However, that hype wouldn’t last. So OMVS (its CEO and only employee) found a way to extend the hype and protect OMVS from this dilution (and protect his job). A merger with RAD would boost the share price to protect OMVS from dilution.

So what does RAD get from this? Well RAD was and is making no money. The hype from the merger allowed RAD to acquire a shell it could use to sell shares and raise more capital. The hype from the merger essentially is keeping both these entities (now a single entity) afloat. 

This should be obvious. Why would a company with a supposedly bright future (RAD) voluntarily merge with a shell carrying $20M in debt?

I also think most shareholders misunderstand what RAD actually does. RAD is a dealer for SMP Robotics. SMP manufactures and programs these security robots and sells them to RAD. They were listed on the SMP website as a dealer before the merger. This distinction is important when you see people saying “RAD gets XXX in revenue per bot.” Revenue doesn’t matter. Margins matter. The latest Q indicates a margin of ~25%. Without the derivative liabilities and assuming operating expenses remain relatively fixed (with the exception of COGS) OMVS needs to lease ~250+ robots to break even. The last Q indicates 2 are currently leased. 

I predict that the reverse split and name change will be accompanied by continued dilution until this firm eventually declares bankruptcy.";52422;For anyone wondering what happened with OMVS;

dirtywiggle;1525201263;8gaxy9;;14;;0;"Did not feel like trading today so I sold my morning positions and called it a day. Running low on day trades for now. Well yesterday I shot 100% on overnight calls. All had some solid 10%+ morning spikes that one could sell into. I got some from UHLN and IFXY but they went way beyond what I imagined for spike. I will take 10%. We have a great day for overnights with some solid options just watch how they close before getting into any of them. 

BIEL was one I have been watching for a couple days to gauge how it runs and I am left sad I was not in it. OTC multiday breakout and seems like a relatively safe play overnight and moves slow enough to not stress people. 

AXXA is just wild and appears capped at 0.35 with a descent coming but who knows with this thing. Volume is still huge and could pick up steam heading into close. Risky boy though. 

IFXY  is a runner picking up steam also but it may be capped out and is less of a sure bet for a morning spike but it is always a watcher because of volatility

UHLN is one of my favorites as always providing dip buys and good overnight plays. I see the case being the same today if you can watch it for a dip. 

BRKK is one of the least predictable ones to me but has overnight upside. Seems to have stalled out so I cannot say with certainty. Everyone can make their own decision on it.

BIEL has been a good little runner now for some time going on news of an upcoming FDA review for a product. Running as it is gaining more attention. By far the most stable thing in this wild time. Might hold it for a long time tomorrow after evaluating it later. 

AXXA is the little engine that could that breaks all laws and support. I think we see yet another morning spike but that is just me. I thought it would die mid day yesterday but no why would it. Will give you dip buys for sure tomorrow. Not as volatile as it was but still a great one to play with. 

UHLN I expect a morning spike again and it will give us a little run in the morning but otherwise it may be dead. We will see mid day. 

IFXY has been a nice runner and overnight player for a while. This is a major determining day of will it continue to run or did it top out. The answer we find tomorrow but it will have something to give us.

8k - The acquisition is contingent on Galenfeha’s ability to raise the funds, and the Company has engaged Wall Street firm Paulson Investment Company, LLC as the lead placement agent for financing the transaction.

Galenfeha’s founder, Mr. James Ketner stated: “We have a lot of work to do, and I want to inform the public of some upcoming changes, so there are no surprises. Mr. Trey Moore, President/CEO, and founder of Fleaux Services, is assuming the role of Galenfeha’s Chief Executive Officer. I believe there is nobody more qualified to take the position, as he is a young, charismatic leader with a great operational history in the oil and gas industry. He has the ability to lead the company to continued growth in the future. I will be working directly with Mr. Moore over the next several months as he transitions into the role.”

Building on his historic relationships in the oil and gas industry, Trey Moore founded Fleaux Services six years ago. The company is now a premier provider of oil and gas measurement, automation, and control equipment, boasting revenues of approximately $21m in 2016, approximately $36m in 2017, and revenues for first quarter 2018 of approximately $12m.

Here’s a list of the companies Paulson has helped uplist to the big boards by the way. Can you find any start ups listed under 5.00$. Seriously look for yourself I stopped after the first dozen. So GLFH is acquiring a business that makes money hand over fist....acquiring a placement agent to acquire even more investors that has uplisted numerous companies to the big leagues for multiple dollars

I made an old post about this with some great DD a while ago. This is only trading a .23 I think. Amazing price considering where this is going!

Previous 8k before this purchase a while back described how they projected 0.04 EPS and 8 Mil revenue from their existing company. That’s a 0.80 PPS projection! 

Read up on the filings on this one gents. It’s all there. Pretty easy to find. 10Q deadline for this one is May 15th which will show their revenues from Q1 —-&gt; the real catalyst that sends this up another level. Enjoy!";52698;GLFH - 8k - 5/3 - Acquires Fleaux Services LLC!;

LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / May 9, 2018 / Applied BioSciences Corp. (OTCQB: APPB), a diversified cannabinoid therapeutics company focused on the medical, bioceutical and pet health industries, today announced that the Company's wholly-owned animal health subsidiary TherPet has entered the equine health space with the launch of a new full-spectrum hemp-derived cannabidiol (""CBD"") supplement formulated specifically for a horse's health and wellness.

TherPet's Equine Care CBD line is a natural supplement designed to play a key role in keeping horses, healthy, looking good and performing their best. Our Equine Care CBD products support healthy skin, joints and immune system as well as to ease the discomfort of fatigued muscles, stiff joints and arthritis pain.

Like humans, horses also have an endocannabinoid system comprised of cannabinoid receptors that help regulate a wide variety of bodily functions ranging from pain relief to mood.

""Regularly supplementing a horse's endocannabinoid system with full-spectrum CBD enables horses to better control inflammatory responses naturally,"" noted JJ Southard, Vice President of Products at Applied BioSciences Corp. ""Despite millions of spectators tuning in to watch twenty of the fastest thoroughbred horses compete in the Kentucky Derby this past weekend, very few of them realize or consider the race-induced inflammation and injuries that take place during such an event.""

David Horohov, Ph.D., William Robert Mills Chair at the University of Kentucky's Gluck Equine Research Center, believes that horses as a breed are not necessarily becoming more fragile, but rather more susceptible to injury due to breeding strategies, training methods, and increased drug use. The Company hopes to reverse this trend by making Therpet's new treatment options available immediately for veterinarians, trainers, and equestrians.

Therpet's Equine Care tincture is available in a 4800 mg concentration which is packaged in a 4 fl. Oz. (120ml) bottle. The tincture is a naturally formulated Apple flavor, made with lab tested, CO2 extracted, pure full-spectrum CBD oil sourced from pesticide-free, Colorado grown hemp and specially formulated to be the highest bioavailability CBD products in the marketplace.

TherPet products are USDA NOP certified organic, non-GMO, vegan, paleo, gluten-free, sugar-free and THC-free. The products are formulated with organic 99%+ pure cannabidiol along with our proprietary blend of certified organic botanical, herbal and essential oils to further optimize bioavailability.

Am looking for new plays and the only tolerable plays left are UOIP after morning panics and UHLN. AXXA is like juggling knives and can kill an account in a day. That said it still could recover a day this week but so risky

BIEL is subject to people waiting for FDA news. When the news on the meeting did not come out, it looked like ANDI when people expected more. I expect a recovery like last time and am not nervous to hold for a day. You have to watch the morning and see if the news comes out. If not people sell and do not want in after 9:31 pretty much and we saw that today. Luckily it never dips late day. 

UHLN is another that is a good play only if you get a dip buy. Set your limit and stick with it. Still gives short morning spikes but be fast. It is back to pre-spike levels and tomorrow morning will be telling for it. ";53143;Overnight plays for 5/10: BIEL UHLN;

investheory;1526007608;8iklhg;;3;;5;"AVP was on my list for today but it never hit my price of $1.91. The MFI is in the perfect range sitting below 20. On top of this there is very nice volume, likely from all the selling it has done post earnings. Also, looking at the NASDAQ historical for AVP it has some good distance between the high and low\(again this could be because of the drop but it means there is room to make 5&amp;#37; in a day/swing trade\). On top of all this we have what could potentially be a nice reversal candlestick pattern showing. This is the Gravestone Doji. A doji means there is indecision in the market. When a Doji forms after a bullish/bearish run that is a good indication of a reversal. Typically Gravestone Doji’s are found at the end of a bullish run. I love seeing them in a bearish downtrend because it almost always\(in my trading adventures\) means a quick green day. 

I’m setting a buy for AVP tomorrow at $1.95. I’m allocating 5k for this trade so I will buy half my position at $1.95 hoping to scoop up 1,282 shares. If the price continues downward towards $1.91 I will likely complete the other half of my order. Shooting for 5&amp;#37; with a price target of $2.05 as of now.";53184;Buying AVP Tomorrow;

Vista, Calif., May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Flux Power Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: FLUX), a developer of advanced lithium batteries for industrial material handling applications such as electric forklifts and airport ground support equipment, announced today that it has completed $800,000 in funding through a private placement of restricted common stock priced at $0.70 per share.

The common stock was placed directly by the Company with five accredited investors at a 35% premium to yesterday’s closing price of $0.52, and no warrants were issued. The pricing reflects Flux’s accelerating sales, strong industry position and long-term growth potential as well as the limited liquidity of Flux’s common stock. The placement was part of a rolling close, and Flux anticipates further closings on these terms. Flux Power now has 26.3 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

Proceeds from the financing will be used to support the sales ramp for Flux’s state-of-the-art lithium-ion LiFT Pack forklift battery technology. Flux LiFT Packs provide substantial performance, energy efficiency, safety, and environmental and maintenance benefits over lead-acid batteries – all at a lower total cost of ownership. Moreover, Flux LiFT Packs are based on safe cell chemistry and are the first UL 2271 listed lithium battery offering to power forklifts – the indispensable workhorses of material handling and logistics. Flux estimates the total market opportunity for lithium-ion forklift batteries in North America at approximately $10B.

Flux CEO Ron Dutt, commented, “We are grateful for the support and confidence of these investors on terms that reflect both a substantial growth opportunity and Flux’s long term investment potential. We are seeing excellent traction for our initial product line for Class 3 walkie pallet jack forklifts, as well as broad interest and demand for more powerful solutions targeting the larger Class 3 end rider, Class 1 counter balance and Class 2 narrow aisle forklifts. We plan to launch commercial production of our Class 3 end rider and Class 1 LiFT pack solutions in the near term and follow on with the launch of battery packs for Class 2 forklifts later in calendar 2018.”

vytasmike;1526322666;8jemqm;;30;;44;"How to trade penny stocks?

Let’s continue with the video project in which I use Google search data to filter out most common questions and terms people search related to penny stocks.

Next most asked question which beginner trader asks is “how to trade penny stocks?”.

Here is the next video:

https://youtu.be/WzkOP06o\_ZM

And here is as well written content to answer your question.

I squeezed video main points into three simple steps.

1. First and foremost you need to have a stockbroker. I do believe in today’s market all stockbrokers are available online. They will provide you with a trading platform through which you can make an orders to buy or sell stocks \(check video for best options\).
2. Learn about trading in general. Trading is trading, guys! Trading is more technical way to operate in the financial market of your choice. Traders use various charting analysis techniques \(examples: Japanese candlestick technique; value spread analysis, classical charting &amp; technical analysis and others\) or various indicators \(examples: RSI; moving averages; fibonacci retracements levels and more\) to predict future price trends. So learn about trading in general because it is applicable to all markets you will be interested in trading. Just small recommendation \- don’t be afraid to incorporate some parts of fundamental analysis into your overall analysis \- it gives bigger edge to your trading. Believe it!
3. Understand the market or niche you trade and its specifics. So if you are interested in trading micro and nano cap stocks aka penny stocks, here it is: to trade penny stocks successfully you need to know few fundamental things about this stock niche. Many penny stocks tend to trend down \(due to poor companies financial performance\), so this niche is perfect for short sellers to find great short selling opportunities. To quickly introduce you to short selling \- short seller is a trader who profits when stock’s price is trading lower. Most online stockbrokers allow you to short sell stock with the click of the button. Next, penny stocks and all these low floating stocks are famous for huge home runs. These small stocks can double within the day. It is very common for microcap stock to finish week with 100&amp;#37; gains. But these quick price spikes tend to stretch further to oblivion for sometime and then crash down another days taking all profits away. You need to be quick with these runners because many traders are rushing to close their position with profit simply by selling their shares to the market \(other participatns\) and going out with cash. To finish here, if you are interested to day trade penny stocks be aware that liquidity can be an issue, meaning it can be hard to close position, so do not start betting big on these stocks and if you are rookie only look to day trade penny stocks that have decent daily trading volume. This is way trade penny stocks on reguler stock exchanges is a safe choice.

The business is cyclical but it currently appears to be in the early stages of an upswing. Demand is growing and supply is tight as OPEC reported yesterday that the global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, driven by plunging Venezuelan supply and Iran’s supply now looking doubtful.

The contingent payment will be paid as a multiple of 2.75 times annual EBITDA for 12 months to June 2018 in excess of $18 million. It is a number that has been growing strongly with FYE December 2017 EBITDA of $15.9 million up from $6.9 million in 2016 and guidance for Q1 EBITDA of $4.5 million up from $2.6 million last year.

With such growth a significant contingent payout looks likely. EBITDA of $27.6 million would result in a maximum payout of $0.45 per share. A recent Daseke presentation suggest Daseke expects to payout the full amount. But with the stock priced on CAD$0.97 the returns look skewed towards the upside with a CAD$0.90 payment almost assured (given large shareholder approvals) and returns of a further CAD$0.45 looking a real possibility.

Marijuana industry is already booming and we can see emerging businesses. As well more and more states legalizing recreational marijuana. I see MJ industry as one of the most lucrative niches to trade/invest. I hope you are interested to learn more and find out about:

1. how legalization of MJ helps propel public interest which impacts marijuana stock prices. I will be using Google trends to show you recent biggest spikes in the interest and how it affected MJ penny stock prices;
2. will show you popular infographic from 2014 with MJ penny stock examples;
3. will talk about MJ laws and regulations. How regulations impacted interest in MJ industry. As well will talk about why Canada’s marijuana stock niche will have major fundamental event NEXT MONTH;
4. and as always will talk about risks, while I know how much trading and such opportunities can elevate emotions and what not to do. As well will touch upon difference in investing in marijuana stock and trading/speculating them.

Also with the ratio of sells/buys today (sells outweighing buys by a lot) coupled with the fact that the sp has hardly moved indicates to me that this is bottom and MM’s are absorbing shares. If you missed this when I was posting about it before the last run, this may be the best chance to get in before it goes again.

InterestingNews1;1526581140;8k6gqp;;3;;0;"Beware it’s a highly speculative mico-cap spin-off but the interesting thing here is that when it was spun off by Fluent Inc the management team saw big opportunities and shifted from the larger Fluent to the smaller sized Red Violet.

This team have form having previously built up and sold TLO LLC and Seisant Inc 

Red Violet CFO said prior to the spin-off “what we are looking at in 2018 is growing revenue exponentially and because of the fixed cost model and how every dollar revenue comes in as contribution margins, we expect by the fourth quarter that you will start to see positive adjusted EBITDA and by the end of the year profitability within that business”

And that still looks well on track in Q1 earnings reported on Monday when
- Total revenue increased 112% to $3.3 million.
- Adjusted gross profit increased 665% to $1.3 million.
- Adjusted gross margin increased to 39% from 11%.

ACCESSWIRE	ACCESSWIRE•May 21, 2018
BELGRADE, MT / ACCESSWIRE / May 21, 2018 / Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: XTNT), a leader in the development of regenerative medicine products and medical devices, announces U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for InTice™-C Porous Titanium Cervical Interbody System.

InTice-C is designed using OsteoSync Ti, a best-in-class, cost-effective, highly porous titanium scaffold material for improved implant fixation. The material more closely resembles the bioscaffold of cancellous bone, and further combines Xtant Medical's hardware and biologic portfolios. In addition to InTice-C serving as a bioactive scaffold, it is also cleared for use with Xtant's proprietary allograft lines, including OsteoSponge®, 3Demin® Cortical Fibers, and OsteoVive™ viable cell allograft.

""InTice-C represents Xtant's latest addition to our spinal implant portfolio and is our first spinal implant to be engineered using a best-in-class porous titanium material,"" stated Dr. Gregory Juda, Chief Scientific Officer and General Manager of Xtant Medical. ""The porous architecture of the titanium was designed to improve implant fixation, both prior and post fusion. We expect a positive reception of this technology from our surgeon customers in the cervical spine market.""

The InTice-C Is designed to provide cervical intervertebral body fusion options for each patient's varied anatomy. It is offered in multiple footprint, height and endplate options. The commercial pure titanium structure offers continuous pore interconnectivity from the top to the bottom as well as from the outer perimeter to the large central graft cavity of the implant. This optimizes vascularization to the fusion site allowing the implant to be a participant in the fusion process.

GlobeNewswire•May 22, 2018
LAS VEGAS, May 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Via OTC PR Wire  – South American Gold Corp (SAGD), is pleased to announce that the “The Kush Journals,” a wholly owned subsidiary of SAGD, recently held interviews and conversations with some of the cutting-edge leaders within the cannabis industry. 

""The MJBizCon NEXT conference is an excellent cannabis conference for our podcasting team,” said David Reeves, SAGD CEO. “The conference is filled with companies new and old sharing their most cutting-edge processes, services, and products with the world. We are a company intent on staying ahead of the cannabis curve and speaking with important companies and industry leaders is one way we ensure our longevity and relevancy. And certainly our presence at this conference opens the door wider for strategic partnerships as SAGD passionately pursues acquisitions and joint-ventures.”

The podcasting team works hard to foster industry relationships to further its media reach in order to attend these events as credentialed media. The access granted to media members far surpasses that of the average conference attendee.

“We will publish each interview on separate days this week, starting with our first interview with Mr. Morris Denton,” said Peterson. “Listeners will quickly get a feel for the current state of industry affairs, as well as what’s on the horizon. In short, it’s all very exciting. What a great time to be in the cannabis industry!” concluded Peterson.

ConnorSSB;1527126210;8lovg6;Question;7;;3;"Backstory: 

I have a mentor/friend who devotes about 15% of his portfolio to penny stocks. Sometimes he wins, sometimes he loses. He’s an old school investor in the sense that he does a ton of homework on companies he wants to invest in before doing so and holds/plays the long game. 

I’ve noticed him slipping a bit over the last few years - he’s getting older and having some health issues. At the same time, his routine and time he spends investing is what gives him purpose. 

His most recent penny stock purchase was  200,000 shares of ACB.TO back at around $11/share. He has faith in the company and plans to hold. He also has a sick family member who uses the oils they make - I think that definitely swayed his decision to invest so heavily. He ultimately expects the national legalisation of marijuana in Canada to send the stock back up. 

My question:

Obviously on paper he’s lost a good chunk of change thus far on ACB. I don’t have any experience with penny stocks and I’m not sure what to make of his investment. I know he could end up losing far more than he already has, or he could end up getting his money back and then some. 

Is my friend slipping? Is his judgement clouded? Would you hold onto ABC at this point?

vytasmike;1527197807;8lwek7;;11;;58;"Hello, traders, so here is the next video from my video project where I use Google’s search data to answer questions or explain search terms related to penny stocks. In today’s video I will talk about day trading penny stocks.

So I took many recent spikers and great stocks that were great day trading opportunities as examples so to give you idea what possible great setup looks like and what you need to look for to find one.

Watch the video: [https://youtu.be/rRJ\_4T1uSGo](https://youtu.be/rRJ_4T1uSGo)

If you are here just for the details \(or are more interested to read the content\) here are main points from the video:

1. When day trading penny stocks prefer nano cap size company’s stock. If you watched my previous videos you know that nanocap stock is stock with market capitalization less than $50mln. Why is that? Because low market cap stocks most of the time have low share float which basically is the cause for possible huge swings. As well if you still struggling with explanation for low float \- floating stock is the number of shares available for trading of a particular stock \([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating\-stock.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp)\).
2. Look for huge/abnormal volume during trading day. This one is as well very important because then there are more shares traded than there is float we get what trades call float rotation meaning that float is traded more than once. As aside from this big volume allow for more liquidity during the increased volume time. Why this is important? Because it is easier to find other side of the bet, so trader can get it and out easily and can trade more shares.
3. Another great technical indicator you should look for is breakout. It is very important for stock price to break above multi week or even better multi month resistance level. If it does with bigger than usual volume for technical analysis perspective you can consider it as genuine breakout.
4. Other  important thing is to look for positive news. News article and great PR stunt attracts more participants to look at the stock and possibly to  trade it. Huge price spikes are accompanied with great and positive news for the company which shares are being traded. Well distributed news can influence stock volume by attracting more traders to trade stock.
5. And last but not least word for caution. Remember that most penny stocks after gapping up premarket will lose its value same day or more likely next day. This is why I even coined one of my strategies second day short because possibility that stock will finish next day in red after huge spike day is insanely huge. This is why I am more successful short selling these stocks and I as well welcome you to short sell these stocks. This is why I if I can I like to short sell them when day trading. But I am always looking for that next huge day trading opportunity \(I call them moby dicks\) to buy into like $CNET on Jan 2018. But if you want to know how I protect myself to buy into profitable day trades and avoiding possible selloffs after market open, watch the video, I shared my 10 minute rule which helps me avoid buying losing stocks.

Hope you guys liked this content and learned some new things about penny stocks. Let me know if this material is useful and if you have questions let me know them, I would love to hear from you.

NEW YORK, May 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Century Petroleum Corp. (CYPE) (“Century” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding letter agreement dated as of May 25, 2018 (the “Letter Agreement”) with a leading Nigerian-based cement company, Ibeto Cement Company Limited (“Ibeto”). The Letter Agreement outlines the proposed terms and conditions pursuant to which Century Petroleum Corp and Ibeto Cement Company Limited will effect a business combination that will result in a reverse takeover of Century Petroleum by the shareholders of Ibeto Cement Company Limited (the “Proposed Transaction”). The Letter Agreement was negotiated at arm’s length. Per the Agreement, Dr. Cletus Ibeto has acquired 70% control of Century Petroleum Corp. Effective May 24, 2018, Mandla J. Gwadiso, newly appointed Chairman and CEO of Century Petroleum Corp has stepped down and Dr. Cletus M. Ibeto has been appointed as the new Chairman of the Board effective immediately. Dr Cletus Ibeto was advised by Palewater Advisory Group Inc. on this transaction.

Ibeto Cement Company Limited, a privately held company organized/incorporated under the Nigerian laws, is one of the most dominant players in the fast-growing cement industry in Nigeria and, by extension, Africa. To increase its production and packaging capacity, the Ibeto Cement Company Limited is currently developing two cement plants in Nigeria namely: – one in Ebonyi State and one in Cross River State/Abia State. Each of the plant is a State-of-the-art 6,000 Metric Tons-per-day (TPD) plant and are sitting on an abundant deposit/reserve of quality limestones.

Ibeto Cement Company Limited is owned by the industrial Nigerian Billionaire -  Dr. Cletus Madubugwu Ibeto, CON. Dr Ibeto is a world-class business leader and enterpreneur who has built successful companies/industries in Nigeria and beyond. Through Ibeto Cement Company Limited, Dr Ibeto has seriously impacted the cement market in Nigeria. This transaction will enable Ibeto Cement Company Limited to raise sufficient capital to dominate the industry in Nigeria and West African sub region as a whole.

Kent A. D. Clark, Chairman of Palewater Global Management Inc., the current parent company of Century Petroleum Corp, stated thus:

""The reverse merger with Century Petroleum Corp is a vital step in becoming a vibrant public company and is a key element of our growth strategy.  This reverse merger is a significant accomplishment for the Palewater Global Management Inc. Team."" Clark continued, ""We believe the positioning of Century Petroleum Corp. as a publicly-traded company will afford all the greatest opportunity to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for high quality, lower-cost industrial products around the world.”

Dr. Cletus Ibeto, The Chairman of The Ibeto Group, the parent company of Ibeto Cement Company Limited, Nigeria, opined that:

“Our key strategic objective in the vast and extensive development of Cement business in Nigeria and West African sub-region is to make cement affordable to all Nigerians and tiers of government in such a way that they should be able to develop modest homes for themselves and their families inclusive of road infrastructure. As far as I am concerned and with the knowledge I have and what I know in this business, the cement business is an investors’ haven especially in Nigeria and a much more profitable business than crude oil where a lot of people think is the best place to invest. This probably explains why the few people in the business have deliberately created very strong barrier to entry into the industry for prospective investors. It is therefore my honest belief that this reverse merger will enable us to accomplish this objective. In the end and, in line with our strategic intent and objective, we are geared to be a world-class cement company in terms of quality, affordability, innovation, service, environment, safety, and corporate governance and also to be a part of building the country’s needed infrastructure.

Dr Ibeto continued, it has been a long journey since I have been in business and none of my companies or businesses has been public. I have a desire to build a formidable structure for companies that will outlive me.";54270;$WSML $CYPE Century Petroleum Announces The Proposed Reverse Merger With A Nigerian Businessman;

""Hi Rick,
 
We are expecting that the definitive agreement for the first two planes to be signed before the end of June and we expect a news release with details and timing shortly.

hackpennystocks;1527564358;8mvwwf;;10;;25;"Hey, guys, as most of you know I've been trading penny stocks for over 8 years now. My penny stock strategies consist of many different styles simply because I have to adapt to the fluctuations and changes in the market. That being said, I don't have a lot of stocks in this particular watchlist since I only trade stocks above $1.00 w/ high relative volume. Most of the successful penny stock traders I know trade between $2-$5 penny stocks. Only 3 stocks were generated from my stock screener today. Here is the following list:

VTGN $1.47 +51.55%


ADOM $1.64 +50.46%


PXS $1.31 +21.30%


VTGN - Stock closed at my divisible by 5 rule. Based on the past 4 historical climax patterns there's a higher probably of another climax pattern occurring. Tomorrow the stock could crash as we've seen in the past w/ this stock.


ADOM - This stock topped out at $1.70 the other day so I would keep this as a level or resistance and we might see a double top pattern (for my students that's in video 5). If stock can sustain a level above $1.70, it would make a great buying opportunity as the volatility could keep it moving higher.


PXS - Some penny stock traders were talking about this on Friday, expecting it to go higher ($2-$3). Substantiated by what, exactly? Stock stopped at my divisible by 5 rule as well and came crashing back down to the $1.30s.

JACKSONVILLE, FL and ORO VALLEY, AZ, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Drone Aviation Holding Corp. (OTCQB: DRNE) (“Drone Aviation” or the “Company”), a manufacturer of tethered drones and lighter-than-air aerostats, today announced that its FUSE Tether System was utilized in a first-of-its-kind application of tethered drone technology by the Oro Valley Police Department as part of its security and monitoring efforts at two major high school graduation ceremonies held in southern Arizona in May 2018.

During the two events, the Oro Valley Police Department operated a DJI Matrice 200 drone powered by Drone Aviation’s FUSE Tether System, flying the drone at an altitude of 150 feet for hours at a time. The drone operated continuously for hours without the need to recharge or swap its batteries since uninterrupted power was provided by the FUSE Tether System’s ground-based generator. Utilizing the drone’s optical camera, officers were able to monitor the venue’s perimeter and the flow of people and traffic in and out of the school’s facilities in real time.

“In this time of frequent headlines reporting horrifying attacks at schools and public gatherings, we are honored and gratified that our FUSE Tether System was able to enhance the security surrounding these events,” said Jay Nussbaum, Chairman and CEO of Drone Aviation. “The use of our tethered technology in applications such as this further validates our strategy of adapting our military-grade tethered technology in a system that can be deployed by law enforcement, first responders and commercial users to improve public safety.”

These law enforcement operations followed a recent drone technology demonstration event in Oro Valley where the FUSE Tether System was showcased to numerous state and local law enforcement officials. The showcase was led by Oro Valley Police Lt. John Teachout, a leading advocate for drone use in law enforcement. The demonstration focused on highlighting the capabilities of the FUSE Tether System and drones such as the DJI Matrice M200 in applications including venue security, crowd management and incident response, replacing the need to employ expensive helicopters.

“The threats to public safety are changing, demanding new ways to gather situational awareness in real time, and we believe that tethered drones can be a valuable tool in helping protect our communities and the public at large. With the innovative FUSE Tether System from Drone Aviation, we were able to integrate long-duration drone flight without interruption, significantly enhancing the capabilities of law enforcement and first responders,” said Lt. John Teachout.

The FUSE Tether System is powered by a proprietary mix of hardware and software in a customized power pack and an Automated Smart Tension Control Winch Case with 200 feet of tether supporting 110-volt ground power sources such as portable generators. With the FUSE Tether System, DJI Inspire 2 and M200 users can dramatically and cost-effectively increase drone flight time with uninterrupted power from the ground while benefiting from improved safety. Safety is enhanced by FUSE’s use of an onboard backup power pack and tether connected to the Company’s proprietary automatic tether tension management system. FUSE is based on the same military-grade advanced technology utilized in the Company’s tethered products sold to the U.S. Department of Defense.

JACKSONVILLE, FL, June 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Drone Aviation Holding Corp. (OTCQB: DRNE) (“Drone Aviation” or the “Company”), a manufacturer of tethered drones and lighter-than-air aerostats today announced that it will provide a livestream of B&amp;H Photo’s Aerial Logistics and Emergency Response Technology Expo. The expo will be held at Suffolk County Police Headquarters where the FUSE Tether System will be demonstrated in partnership with Drone Nerds.

Scheduled for June 5, 2018 in Yaphank, New York, representatives of over 200 local departments and agencies from around the New York-area including the FBI and Secret Service, the New York Police Department Counter Terror Unit, and Nassau and Suffolk County Police and Fire departments, have been invited to attend the event.

In response to several special requests for tethered products, Drone Aviation’s FUSE Tether System has been selected and will be featured in an aerial demonstration at the show. The demonstration will feature how persistent tethered solutions can provide real-time, high definition imagery as well as secure communications for various applications. The Company will demonstrate live streaming capability utilizing its proprietary cellular LTE backhaul technology which is capable of securely distributing full motion video. The livestream will be available from 10:00 am Eastern to 12:00 pm Eastern subject to airspace availability and can be viewed here: https://www.droneaviationcorp.com/livestream

“Interest in Drone Aviation’s tether system continues to grow as law enforcement and first responders increasingly recognize the tremendous value that longer drone eye-in-the-sky flight duration can have on their operations. Furthermore, as we are now demonstrating, tethered drone technology can provide access to altitude for monitoring and surveillance applications filling the gaps created by current aerial platforms such as helicopters which are expensive to operate,” said Jay Nussbaum, Chairman and CEO of Drone Aviation.

Attendees at the Aerial Logistics and Emergency Response Technology Expo will learn firsthand about Drone Aviation's tethering technology and products designed to enhance public safety and law enforcement programs and see several different aircraft performing operations in a variety of scenarios, including:

Search and Rescue - Aircraft utilizing thermal imagery to locate a ‘missing person’ in a wooded area
Barricade - Troop deployable rapid air asset during an ‘active shooter’ situation
Crowd Control - Eye in the sky ops for improved situational awareness
Crash Scene Investigation - Autonomous accident scene imaging
Crash Risk Mitigation - Live parachute drop tests of various aircraft
The FUSE Tether System is powered by a proprietary mix of hardware and software in a customized power pack and an Automated Smart Tension Control Winch Case with 200 feet of tether supporting 110-volt ground power sources such as portable generators. With the FUSE tethering system, DJI Inspire 2 and M200 users can dramatically and cost-effectively increase drone flight time with uninterrupted power from the ground while benefiting from improved safety. Safety is enhanced by FUSE’s use of an onboard backup power pack and tether connected to the Company’s proprietary automatic tether tension management system. FUSE is based on the same military-grade advanced technology utilized in the Company’s tethered products sold to the U.S. Department of Defense.

Read and digest Stockmoney2's words here. This is the BIG picture!!

*** Now were connecting dots.. *** 

Quoted from 22 yr Ihub Vetern ""zyx1002"" :

""Here are the facts and I will share what I have verified: 

1) Sohm has real generic drug manufacturing facility in India as many others 

2) A big % of prescription and generic drugs we buy here in USA are made in India 

3) FDA has huge staff in India and infact they have staff permanently stationed in the office of the big drug manufacturers like Ranbaxy 

4) You need licensing to make those drugs in India and bring them over which is a painstaking and long process in India and Sohm has the licensing 

5) They were selling drugs in the USA and in fact, they hosted a pre-oscar party a few years back where they gave them out as goody bags. It is well documented and I know of one big name Hollywood producer who was in that party. 

6) The generic drug market is highly competitive in USA and it is not easy to sell them here. 

7) The CEO had a heart attack in 2015 and various health complications and everything stopped 

8) Now he is back in charge and pretty much restarting the effort and have already signed some good distribution agreement 

9) Yes they have diluted some in the past but that is nothing compared to most OTC players who dilute billions of shares with no business at all. 

10) I have gotten confirmation that there is no dilution happening now or in near future. They have gotten money to operate the company and sign new distribution agreements. 

11) They may have paid themselves which every CEO of a public company does so. They have to pay their bills too. 

12) In summary, this freaking thing is trading at 0.0008 not $8 for all those shortcomings. But it is not a scam. It is a real business. 

13) Now the CEO is getting it back on track. Let us hope he is successful. 

14) It is worth at least a penny imho. ""

---- Conclusion ----

My best friend bought this at .0009 today and I feel like he already owes me a boat.. This is hands down the best triple penny play run since the BVT* run of July 17, which many will remember I spearheaded... This is it people.. All out alert to all family in friends. Buy NOW or keep eyes on this ticker!!
Umm. My first big DD packet so go easy on me.. Kinda just quoted alot but I'm happy with it. Be nice. Good luck to all. In my honest opinion.

Petroselinum_;1528335325;8p6b5i;Question;14;;1;"Bought in the first time at 1.09 but sold for quick gains at 1.20. Still pissed I didn’t hold.

Second time around, I bought in at 2.54, nearly at the ATH. What a mistake. It tumbled more than 8% the next day. Predictable, since that parabolic increase just wasn’t sustainable. 

Thus begs the question - is the run-up truly over? Or is it just going to bounce off support levels at ~$2.03 and continue to rise? Should I sell for a 10% loss? Or, should I continue to hold... and risk bag-holding the damn thing? (And, does the Senate Hemp Bill even actually mean anything for $CVSI?)

Want to mention that I lost over 70% of my portfolio because I went all-in $RXMD and bag-held past the point of recovery - I went in at $0.2385, sold at $0.08.  Point is, I don’t want to bag-hold again, so I want to be cautious about hanging on to $CVSI for too long.

TL;DR - lost most of my money bag-holding $RXMD. Feels like shit. Don’t want to feel like shit again by messing up my $CVSI play.";55269;Is the $CVSI run-up over?;

These tend to run over 10 cents fairly easily and interest is certainly accruing in LRDR since its sister company, CYPE, went sub penny to $0.60 this year. LRDR will almost certainly cross a nickel within a couple weeks in my opinion and continue steadily as it has been.

vytasmike;1528398101;8pczyw;;6;;63;" This is one of the questions I get asked a lot. The first thing you need to know that there is a lot of stocks to choose from and you need a way to filter out this huge amounts of stocks in order to get to the ones you would be interested to trade. Especially when we are talking about micro and nano\-cap stocks aka penny stocks. There are tons of these small stocks floating on the stock market.

Traders use various stock screeners to help them narrow opportunities to trade and this is where stock screener comes in handy.

If you are just beginner try to use screener provided by [www.finviz.com](http://www.finviz.com/). It is free screener and it does a great job in helping you to filter out huge amounts of stocks. I use this screener in my trading to find swing trading ideas.

Now just to add here. Remember that online stock screeners most of the time do not provide real\-time price data, meaning you will not be able to find stocks that satisfies screener inputs in real time. Most of the time you will need to pay for real\-time price data. This is a problem for day traders because you will need real\-time data while you cannot lose time, while most of the time free screeners provide price data delayed by 20 minutes. This is too much of the time for the day trader to lose.

**BUT** there is one option beginner penny stock day trader can use and that is Yahoo finance screener. It is real time and can help you with finding all kind of liquid small cap stocks traded on Nasdaq or even OTC. Just look for equity screener, select small cap and you can then filter out stocks by percentage change which will help you to show biggest losers and biggest gainers or you can filter out stocks by volume size to show most liquid ones, etc.

As well if you are just beginning to trade and at this right moment, you are looking for online stock broker ask if the broker provides stock screener with a trading platform.

BONUS: if you are interested to know how to use Finviz screener to filter out all micro and nano\-cap stocks traded on Nasdaq, NYSE and Amex stock exchanges and would like to copy paste simple swing trading screener to find your own swing trading ideas watch the video.

Certification Represents BlackRidge Technology's First Cyber Defense Product Approval for use Within Federal Agency Infrastructures

PR Newswire

RENO, Nev., June 20, 2018

RENO, Nev., June 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BlackRidge Technology International, Inc. (OTCQB: BRTI), a leading provider of next generation cyber defense solutions, announced that its BlackRidge Transport Access Control products have been certified for addition to the Department of Defense Information Network Approved Products List (DoDIN APL). This approval allows the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) both domestic and abroad to purchase and operate BlackRidge products within DoD networks.

The DoDIN APL is administered by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and includes only those products certified for use with DoD agencies' technology infrastructure. This designation identifies products that have completed interoperability and cyber security certification via a rigorous testing process conducted by the DoD.  BlackRidge previously received the Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2) validation certificate #3151 for the cryptographic module in its products.

""Government agencies are under relentless cyber-attacks and they need to move away from legacy architectures to the new and resilient approach to cyber defense that BlackRidge Technology provides,"" said Robert Lentz, BlackRidge director and former DoD CISO. ""Congratulations to the team at BlackRidge for achieving this huge milestone of DoDIN APL certification, that enables the DoD and other global defense organizations to move forward with purchasing BlackRidge products.""

""The successful completion of the rigorous certification process required for inclusion on the DoD Approved Products List is a major accomplishment for BlackRidge that accelerates our ability to deliver innovative cyber defense solutions to the federal sector,"" said Bob Graham, CEO of BlackRidge Technology. ""This achievement provides BlackRidge's commercial, federal and defense clients worldwide with high confidence in BlackRidge as a trusted solution provider that closes critical network security gaps and prevents today's cyber-attacks.""

BlackRidge develops, markets and supports a family of products that provide next generation cyber security solutions for protecting enterprise and government networks, systems and cloud services. BlackRidge's patented First Packet Authentication™ technology was developed for the military to cloak and protect servers and segment networks. Cyber-attacks and insider threats are stopped dead in their tracks by preventing unauthorized users and attackers from performing reconnaissance of network and cloud resources, and by denying them the ability to communicate anonymously.

$AMC has launched a competing subscription product, and so have several other movie theater companies. Some say MovePass' competitors' subscription services are inferior, but that's debatable. After all, AMC's subscription service, for example, offers 3 movies per week, unlimited viewings of the same film, discounted food/drink + free upgrades, and all that for just $19.95. A lot more flexibility and added perks for a few more bucks a month. Plus, one movie a day vs. 3 movies a week isn't a huge difference. Unless consumers are intentionally trying to milk the life out of MoviePass, nobody is realistically going  to see seven films a week, let alone even 3.

The point is, $HMNY looks like it's in really bad shape. The stock has been crazily volatile for the pass few days, their cash burn rate has nearly doubled, they might need $1.2b more in capital, stock dilution is occurring at a crazy rate, and they're floating a reverse stock split in June (which will almost definitely lead to further downside).

So on to the question - does $HMNY even have a future? Is the $12-$15 target price by analysts on TipRanks even legit? Or is this the end of MoviePass as we know? 

TL;DR $HMNY doesn't look too hot right now, and MoviePass is getting pummeled. Reverse split in the mix. What to do?

ORLANDO, Fla., June 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Elev8 Brands, Inc. (OTC Pink:VATE), a holding company focused on the commercial development of hemp and CBD-based products including hemp coffee, tea, CBD salve, CBD Lotions and CBD Tinctures that target the health and wellness markets, is pleased to announce the acquisition of L&amp;P Cold Brew, LLC from Blessed Bean Coffee, a Florida Limited Liability Company. The acquisition allows Elev8 Brands to enter the ready to go market, which according to Food Business News, the global sales of ready to go coffee and tea market in 2015 was $71.4 billion.

Elev8 Brands acquired the newly formed L&amp;P Cold Brew to launch its new cold brew product line and to make it a more versatile company adding additional revenue through vertical markets.

""We have had tremendous success with our Blessed Bean Coffee company and have been eager to expand our business into the cold brew sector”, stated Robie Leavitt, Managing Member of Blessed Bean Coffee, ""Working with the Elev8 team has given us the ability to open up a new division of our already profitable business to provide cold brew to our existing customers as well as the ability to create new customers from this high demand market of ready to go coffee drinks.”

According to a report by Grand View Research, Inc. the global ready to drink tea and coffee market size is expected to reach 116.13 billion USD by 2024. US Sales alone in 2017 were over $38.1 million which is up over 460&amp;#37; from 2015.

Ryan Medico, CEO of Elev8 Brands, Inc. stated, ""As we see the market for ready to go coffee and tea drastically increasing, we must jump on the opportunity to develop our own cold brew coffee.

Elev8 Brands is also pleased to announce that within thirty days its audit should be complete per Ben Borgers of BF Borgers CPA PC. Elev8 Brands has submitted its second round of information and will soon be completing its application process to up-list to the OTCQB.

the__dentist;1530037907;8u2g2r;;12;;10;"Hi all, 

I'm a dentist (oral surgeon) and I specifically have interacted with burn surgeons who have used their RECELL product before during investigational studies and overseas. I have no intention to pump this stock, but I would say that if anyone wants to take a look into this company and what they have to offer, then I think that would be a great idea. **I do not support you purchasing this stock, and I also do not support you not purchasing this stock.** **Your decision is entirely up to you, and at this point everything is mere speculation without FDA approval on their PMA.** The stock ticker is on the OTC Market as AVMXY, or if you want to buy on the ASX Australian market then the ticker is AVH. **Disclosure: I own shares of AVMXY and am long**. 

With that said, I believe there is a lot of upside. The company is currently valued at $73mm and they are awaiting a PMA from the FDA expected in Q3 2018. Their recent conference call said that they are ""highly likely"" to gain FDA approval. In fact, the FDA straight up told them to stop the control-arm (split thickness grafting) during their clinical trials because it was producing significantly worse results compared to their RECELL product. If anyone has ever been burned, you would know that Doctors often take a graft (called split-thickness grafting) from your healthy skin to cover up your burn mark. Well the problem with that is 1) your destroying healthy skin, 2) scarring is ugly and immenent, and 3) the worst part is that if a patient has a large burn, then it is highly unlikely that doctors can take a graft big enough to cover their burn. Their RECELL device allows doctors to take a graft about the size of a postage stamp, extract the stem cells from it on-site (takes about \~30 min) and then spray those cells on the graft site and the burn site. Clinical trials have shown that scarring is significantly improved and donor site is significantly smaller. There are no serious adverse events associated with RECELL either, which means that the FDA IS VERY LIKELY TO APPROVE IN THE 3Q 2018! In fact, in 2017 every PMA application that was accepted to be reviewed by the FDA was approved. That's a 100&amp;#37; success rate. 

Financials also have a high upside. Upon FDA approval, BARDA (US Government Division) will execute the remainder of their contract with them worth $64mm (almost their entire market cap) to stockpile their RECELL devices for future disasters. Furthermore, the company has a very strong balance sheet - $0 in debt! There is some near term dilution ahead, but it is to a private investor and it is so they can take advantage of launching into the US market during the 4Q 2018 and 1Q 2019 - which is technically the best time to launch, because during the winter hospitals experience the highest volume of burn victims. 

On a macro scale, the entire healthcare industry is taking a strong shift to ""paying for value"" and finding ways to increase quality of care while decreasing cost of care. The company developed an economic model and determined that RECELL would save a Burn Center on average \~$12mm/year. This is a direct result of RECELL application leading to quicker healing times, faster patient discharge, less patient complications, less patient pain, and higher patient satisfaction.  To put this in laymen terms - a large burn that covers your entire arm would require burn surgeons to cut a section of your healthy skin large enough to cover your burn. Now instead of your burn being the only thing that needs to heal, you also have a section of flesh from your ass or your thigh that needs to heal. Doctors have to monitor both areas, apply dressings and antibiotics to both areas, and prevent infections. This all leads to  longer healing times, worse scarring, and longer stays in the hospital. Unless you live under a rock, you know that hospital real estate is costly by the minute. So any opportunity that allows hospital administration to get patients out of there quicker is likely to be welcomed with open arms. This is why I firmly believe that RECELL will have a HUGE positive impact to add value to burn victims healthcare, while saving hospitals and third-party payers millions of dollars. The only downside I obviously see at this time is dilution coming in July, but this is a good thing because they need the money to scale their manufacturing and sales force. I mean shit, there are already a billion shares out in the ASX market, so I think that this dilution will have a minimal effect. I personally also don't like that they are on the OTC market and are based out of Australia - this is the only company I have ever invested in that was on the OTC market and on the ASX. I think they belong on the NASDAQ but that is not the case with them, unfortunately. Please share your thoughts, and thanks for you time!

maddy_99;1530135740;8udngu;DD;1;;0;" What are the best **penny stocks** to buy today? This is the sort of question I get every day, but it’s a trick question as the answer changes on a day to day basis, and sometimes can shift drastically during the course of a single day. You constantly have to be on top of your studying and research to figure out the answer and trust me, it helps ***BIGTIME*** to get mentored on the process in my trading challenge.

Here, I’ll dish on some tried and true steps that you can take to determine what penny stocks are worth your time on any given day, if you want more details read this new book and also watch [this free penny stock guide](https://inpennystock.com/webinarsignupyt/) ASAP. By asking yourself these questions, you can better determine the best penny stocks to buy today.

**1. Do you know what you’re doing?** Before you can pick the best penny stocks to buy today, be truly honest with yourself…do you know what you’re doing? Do you understand how and why stocks move, how to read a stock chart, and how to research catalysts and volume? Remember, it’s okay not to know much or even anything, my trading challenge teaches the most basic stuff, but it’s those basics that are crucial to your eventual success in an industry where 90&amp;#37; of traders lose money!

 If you don’t know these penny stock basics, then you have bigger things to think about than what penny stocks to trade. You need to figure out how penny stocks work, period. I know it might not be any fun, but it’s important to learn the basics before you start trading; otherwise, you’ll basically be gambling with your hard earned cash.

**2. Are you prepared?** Are you mentally prepared to trade? I mean that in a literal sense. If you’re waking up 5 minutes before the market bell, you’re far more likely to make mistakes. Do yourself the service of giving yourself time to be prepared for the trading day ahead. It is a millionaire habit that makes a big difference.

I’m extremely enthusiastic about waking up early. It gives you a chance to get various tasks out of the way and to do some research so that when the market opens, you’re mentally prepared to trade. Being in the right mindset will help prevent you from making dumb decisions in trades, which means fewer losses.

**3. What’s going on in the market?** Before zeroing in on specific penny stocks, consider the market at large, as it is right now. For instance, if the market is slow, you might not find many spiking stocks or big gainers. You can’t force the market to function how you want it to, so don’t try. It’s better to go with the flow so use [this tool](http://stockstotrade.com/) daily and stay updated with the hottest stocks.

Sometimes, the answer to “what are the best penny stocks to buy today?” is simply none of them. Let the market dictate that: never try to force a trade. It usually won’t end well if you try to make it happen!

**4. What stocks are gaining in volume?** Looking at a stock’s volume is important in determining whether or not it is worth trading. The volume can be determined fairly easily: just look at amount of shares being traded throughout the course of the day. Look at the volume of both buy and sell orders. If the action is high in either direction, the higher the volume of the stock. A high volume stock is simply one that is being traded in large amounts, whether it’s going up or down.

As I said, the high or low volume of a stock can help you decide whether or not a trade is a good move for you. To offer an example: say you see a stock trading with high volume. You can then determine that it’s worth looking at further, because the more movement there is around a stock, the higher the demand. Looking carefully at a stock’s movement should be a big part of your research when choosing which stocks to buy on any given day.

vytasmike;1530218765;8un8ut;;5;;1;"Hi Redditors. I am continuing my video project where I use Google’s search engine data to answer most asked questions and explain searched terms related to penny stocks

I thought not to make video to answer this question (how do penny stocks work?) because I thought I will not make more valuable information as given in previous videos but after thinking more about what person might be asking here I started to realise that what can be important to note for beginner trader is how penny stocks and stocks, in general, begin trading on stock exchanges or OTC markets. I will give a brief explanation about OTCs and regular stock exchange differences.

For the start, you need to understand IPO process. IPO or what is known as the initial public offering is when private company mostly with the help from investment bankers offer its stock to the public for the first time. These companies go public in order to raise capital for their business needs. Stock exchanges have listing rules which companies must satisfy in order to be listed on stocks exchanges. If company undergo IPO process successfully we can then trade them for the first time through our online stock brokers’ platforms.

Check it out some recent IPOs: [https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/activity.aspx?tab=pricings](https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/activity.aspx?tab=pricings)

But most real penny stocks, these nano-cap stock companies (with market capitalization under 50 million dollars) do not satisfy listing rules because they are too small and IPO process itself is very expensive for these companies. The smallest companies that undergo this process is at least microcap stocks that are in a higher bracket (with the market cap from 100 to 500 millions dollars). Most of the time companies that undergo IPO have the market capitalization of at least over 300 million dollars when they start trading on a stock exchange but I saw stocks that get listed with lower first-day market capitalization.

But what to do for smaller companies that cannot be listed on stock exchanges due to lack of resources and size?

These companies can be listed on OTC markets. In USA “OTC Market Group” controls most of these OTC markets. But you might be interested to know how OTC differs from a regular exchange?

To simply put, trading on OTC markets is done through broker-dealers which act as market makers who quote stock prices for those who interested to trade it. Here explanation from Investopedia to get a better understanding: “On an exchange, every party is exposed to offers by every other counterparty, which may not be the case in dealer networks. There is less transparency and less stringent regulation on these exchange,"" so unsophisticated investors take on additional risk and could be subject to adverse conditions.”

In general OTC markets are less regulated and have less listing rules but in contrast, it is less expensive for small companies to get listed there. What is needed for a small company to get listed on OTC markets is to comply with OTC Market Group listing rules than to find broker-dealer which will need to fill form 211 to satisfy SEC rules and boom - stock is trading on OTC markets. We can know trade through our trading platforms.

But if you are interested to see some examples and more ways how companies can list their stocks on stock exchanges or OTC markets check the video link below. In the video, I will talk about regulation A and how companies can use it in order to get listed on stock exchanges or OTC markets. In addition, I will talk about reverse mergers and how private companies use existing public companies called shell companies to get their company shares traded publicly. Reverse mergers are used by big stock manipulators and it is very common in penny stock niche.

no__way__jose;1530544340;8vjdrc;;8;;5;"Last year I posted the following regarding RIBT. I made my first purchase sub 1.00. They've since made pretty big strides in getting back to a positive EPS. The post I made last year was as follows:

===========

**""Company has regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Accordingly, RBT is in compliance with all applicable listing standards and its common stock and warrants will continue to be listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market and NASDAQ considers the matter closed.""**

**Truthfully, I don't know many reasons a company would do this unless they really felt like they wanted to at least appear to be turning it around. Even if they aren't, they might continue to drive their share price up a bit until we know more.**

**-Sold an 18 million dollar subsidiary. Paid off their 12 million in debt. Using some of remainder to start moving forward with other business.** [**https://www.ricebrantech.com/news-room/press-releases/391-ricebran-technologies-sells-healthy-natural-subsidiary-for-18-3-million-in-order-to-focus-on-building-shareholder-value-through-its-ingredient-business**](https://www.ricebrantech.com/news-room/press-releases/391-ricebran-technologies-sells-healthy-natural-subsidiary-for-18-3-million-in-order-to-focus-on-building-shareholder-value-through-its-ingredient-business)

**-Back in May 17 someone renewed a contract for them to supply ingredients for manufacturing. They are definitely doing some sort of business still and I believe the new positions they've filled are to drive similar contracts and revenue.**

**-A private grain company called ""Continental Grain Company"" purchased 16\% stake in RiceBran a few weeks back. Although it's possibly fluff, they're apparently one of the oldest grain trading companies in the world.** [**https://www.ricebrantech.com/news-room/press-releases/399-continental-grain-company-acquires-a-16-equity-interest-in-ricebran-technologies**](https://www.ricebrantech.com/news-room/press-releases/399-continental-grain-company-acquires-a-16-equity-interest-in-ricebran-technologies)

**If a 200 year old grain trading investment company believes RIBT might be positioned correctly in the market, there might be some money to be made.**

**-Unless I am reading it incorrectly, their numbers seem to be turning around over the last 3 years(the ones listed on Yahoo finance.)**

**-RiceBran itself. It has high popularity in ASIAPAC currently and could potentially spread, whether as a fad or legit industry.** 

**High risk, high reward. I'm still new at a lot of this stuff and it's always a gamble. Just finding a possible diamond in the rough company myself without someone telling me to invest is alone worth the risk. If anyone can apply some actual knowledge towards the information available from this company I would definitely be interested to hear your thoughts.**

==================

Their two latest moves have been getting brought into the Russel MicroCap Index and then the FDA accepting a petition to add ricebran(their product market) into the FDA's list of approved dietary fibers. With health and food being a massive market, I can only hope that ricebran taking off would mean RIBT is well positioned.";57828;ReHashing Discussion on $RIBT;

BusyNess101;1530597826;8vputr;;2;;0;"Short version: I am in rather heavy due to recent DD and analyst opinions.  Current cost basis @ 1.02 

Still have a little room to buy more but pretty close to maxed out on what I’d invest here.  

Recent news on phase 1 data released and the SP declined.  Zacks still has this listed as a buy with a decent short term outlook.  

I’m not overly concerned yet but am a little nervous— the SP has tested .85 several times in the last few
Sessions and has declined for consecutive sessions.

I really don’t want to take a loss here but also want to think  about my exit strategy.

NORTHVALE, N.J., July 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Elite"" or the ""Company"") (OTCBB:ELTP), a specialty pharmaceutical company developing abuse-deterrent opioids and niche generic products, today announced that it has received approval of the Company's abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for generic Percocet® (Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Acetaminophen, USP CII) 5 mg/325 mg, 7.5 mg/325 mg and 10 mg/325 mg tablets.  This product is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Based on QuintilesIMS Health data for the twelve months ending May 31, 2018, the retail sales for the brand and generic products were approximately $500 million.
""Oxycodone with Acetaminophen is a strategic addition to our expanding product line.  It is an immediate release opioid product used extensively by doctors today in pain management.  According to the FDA, if the product is crushed and taken intranasally the Acetaminophen creates irritation in the nasal passages and may thereby provide some intranasal abuse-deterrence,"" commented Nasrat Hakim, President and CEO of Elite. ""Elite is committed to developing niche generic products and a diverse range of opioid abuse-deterrent products that incorporate our proprietary sequestration technology and other abuse-deterrent products, such as Oxycodone and Acetaminophen tablets that are niche generic drugs.  We currently have five products filed with the FDA and we look forward to additional product approvals in 2018.""";57991;Elite Pharmaceuticals drug approval;

Martin Luther King III considers internet user rights to be an important part of human rights. On July 4th he took to social media, including Twitter and Facebook, to advocate for users and to share his support for [meggalife.com](http://pr.report/q3BrVvcF), a new social internet platform by EF Hutton that offers users [compensation ](http://pr.report/nKUcRYlt)for their use of apps like [social networking](http://pr.report/m0LYc84n) and communication services.

""I have joined [meggamigo.com](http://pr.report/7rJUhoFZ) and [meggabuzz.com](http://pr.report/LhUxj6oV), which are part of an easy to use social internet platform [meggalife.com](http://pr.report/6OMoW8iZ) \- a creative initiative that enables users to be compensated for using the social internet,"" King tweeted. Following in the footsteps of his parents, King is an internationally recognized human rights activist who supports the need for [user rights](http://pr.report/E2AIQhMm) action.

Speaking at the EF Hutton Talks Conference on User Rights on June 25th King told the crowd, ""User rights is a cause of critical urgency in the 21st century. I certainly believe that while user rights is an issue that has been discussed for a little bit of time, there is a larger opportunity to really begin the process of educating the community about user rights."" A one-minute synopsis of his speech is available online at the EF Hutton Talks Conference Series YouTube channel.

[https://youtu.be/2I1OslsFM2A](https://youtu.be/2I1OslsFM2A)

""In a real sense, perhaps the public has been exploited as often happens through some business opportunity,"" King added. ""But, I believe that when people understand their opportunity digitally they will see the importance of this issue because we all use this creature called the Internet.""

King is asking for all of his followers to join him in spreading the word about this new frontier in socioeconomic injustice by liking and sharing his posts. Follow Mr. King on Twitter @OfficialMLK3, [meggabuzz.com](http://pr.report/mkO0yXWo) and on Facebook @MartinLutherKingIII

hackpennystocks;1530857819;8whrzv;;11;;0;"I'm sure many of you already have heard about my $20,157 profit on $GBR the other day. I posted this on social media, to my students and in some penny stock chat rooms.  The very next day I mentioned this stock, GBR shot up past the level of resistance I mentioned, just as anticipated. One of my strategies is that I trade primarily during the highly volatile ""primetime,"" which is the first 15-20 minutes of trading and the last hour of the trading session. I placed a buy order before the market closed setting my stop-loss where I said it would be a good stop-loss based on my exclusive divisible by 5 rule, and then I woke up the next morning to see that the stock jumped by over 100&amp;#37;!  


A lot of people bought the stock and held the next day, which resulted in a lot of losses. I know many of my students made money since it was my top stock pick of the day, yet the more inexperienced traders jumped in too late and couldn't understand why they lost money. Stop holding onto stocks. Remember, stocks generally run 1-4 trading days...that's IT! I also mention in my videos treat them like a one night stand, not a marriage. Dump it and move on to another more lucrative and volatile stock.  


ANW - Just like $GBR, I wouldn't go chasing this...especially since the stock gained over 200&amp;#37; in a single day. I can almost guarantee the stock will fall tomorrow...(not a 100&amp;#37; guarantee, but a very strong likelihood) based on my strategies ie climax patterns.  


DFBG - If this stock can surpass the previous resistance of $5.45, it will most likely continue to rise. I wouldn't invest in this stock, simply because it, too, is a climax pattern, and we all know what happens to those!  


CVRS - Just as I mentioned in my videos, when a stock is approaching $1, it creates a lot of hype/hope/faith, which can cause more demand, which creates a higher stock price, resulting in profits! Today it reached the $1 divisible by 5 rule. I would keep $1.15 and $1 as my price targets.  

PRAN - There seems to be a lot of resistance around the $2.45 level, so if the price can pierce this resistance, there's a potential buying opportunity here. If there is NOT enough demand, expect the price action to deteriorate.

I've only got a small amount invested for now, as I'm still learning. And don't want to blow any savings trying to figure out the more subtle concepts.
I have a couple quick questions I'll ask here, tho.
1) Robin hood and webull both have ZERO commission fees, which is highly interesting to me. But they both have restrictions on pattern day trading. Is there any way to avoid this, with less than 25k to invest? Or is that a regulatory thing? This is unclear to me.
2) is there any places/methods that anyone can recommend to find new investments? I'm on stocktwits, and I've followed a couple people. I also have simplywallst. I guess I'm just unsure on what separates a hard buy from a soft buy, and what should be a reasonable due process checklist.  Can anyone shed light on their methods?";58237;I know it's been asked before, but...;

NineteenEighty9;1531141562;8xbeo1;DD;9;;5;"Full disclosure: I purchased 110,000 shares of GLH a couple weeks ago after months of research, average cost $0.23. I plan on holding all my shares until at least 2028 (when the NA cannabis industry is projected to mature). I own an investment business &amp; am comfortable with the speculative nature of this stock. GLH is a very speculative investment, please be aware of the risks before investing. Please don’t speculate unless you can afford to lose 100% of your investment.


Golden Leaf holdings (GLH, GLDFF)


I started studying GLH again a few months back while browsing Cannabis companies with operations in Canada and the US. Since then I’ve read every article, statement, quarterly report etc… from GLH i could find. I initially stayed away from the company when I started investing in cannabis because they had a sketchy management team who didn’t do any favours for shareholders, management has now changed. According to the new CEO William Simpson, the founder of Chalice Farms. The only thing left of the old management is the name (see interview linked below). From what I can gather when GLH bought out Chalice Farms last summer Simpson and his people lead a sort of corporate coup, booted the old management and took over. Simpson is now the CEO &amp; his Chalice farms co-founder is the COO (see investor presentation linked below for senior management bios)


This new team appears to have their heads on their shoulders. They have a great track record with Chalice Farms (an award winning dispensary chain with 7 locations in Oregon). My biggest concern with the industry is there is so much emphasis on cultivation that we could be risking an oversupply. On top of that there’s no distribution, it’s great to grow the stuff but you have to be able to deliver it to the end consumer in a profitable way. This will hurt margins at all the producers, big &amp; small. Strategically GLH is in a fantastic position to grow rapidly when US legalization occurs, they’re either licensed or acquiring licenses in most legal US states &amp; Canada. They are nearly cash flow positive and currently have over $22m USD cash on hand. Once they receive their extraction license they’ll become profitable imo. Canaccord Genuity released a report recently staying the company is undervalued.

The plan to sell Chalice farms franchises for $50k is a great way to grow distribution. The biggest value add products in the industry are oils, extracts &amp; edibles, by franchising distribution it’ll help provide some consistent cash flow as well  as a distribution channel for in-house high margin products where they’ll have a say in price, shelf-space etc.. I think Simpson’s focus on more value add products like edibles &amp; oils is brilliant because their margins won’t disappear in the event of over supply (Like in Oregon). Simpson said recently it’s cheaper for them to buy flower on the open market then to produce it due to oversupply. 

Golden Leaf itself will be able to focus on improving their premium brand selection without having to worry about distribution.  They are already in markets like California, Canada, Nevada, Oregon. Once they roll out the franchise systems and the industry matures I believe they’ll be huge. High end recognized brands with quality products are the future of the mainstream cannabis industry IMO. The US cannabis boom will be 10x the size of Canada’s. They have the potential to be the Starbucks of cannabis imo.

Always do your own research before listening to a stranger online lol. I’ve linked everything I’ve read backing up my opinion. I’d love some feedback from more seasoned investors.

potatoclump;1531273309;8xveog;;20;;20;"Hello all,

Today I will be taking you through an analysis of an ongoing speculative play regarding the famously infamous ticker $TGLO.

Now, I know this situation has been brought up on this board one, maybe two times, but that's neither here nor there and to be fair there have been some new developments anyways, so forgive the redundancy of making a new thread.

Well earlier this year, actually more toward the close of 2017, a tremor was felt deep in the cracks of the world of penny stocks. The dirt shook, the earth cried, and out sprouted new growth. The growth was surprising because this once dead organism known as TheGlobe.com had found new life.

Its facilitator, Michael S. Egan, had been patiently and carefully tending to the former IPO behemoth, a slave to his previously fruitful venture into the internet business craze. If you'd like to know more about what happened with the $TGLO IPO I recommend reading up on it. You can probably learn a thing or two about the crooks and setups that occur in this section of the market.

But this analysis isn't actually about $TGLO. It's about an LNG company called Delfin Midstream, Inc.

Now, I hear you saying, ""Why even bring up this dotcom relic if you're talking about a completely different company?"" Well I'll tell you why. During our last winter lull, when the markets finally took some time to cool off, a watchful eye spotted a golden opportunity.

Enter Frederick Jones.

Frederick Jones has been in the energy business for a number of years. People who speak his name dribble oil out of their mouths as a physical adherence to the testament of his legacy. He first came up big when he founded the very successful venture Glencore Inc. Today Glencore is in different hands but is still around at a towering market cap of $46bil. You can read a brief synopsis of his career here as well as find more information about what Delfin is trying to accomplish:

http://lngamericas.cwclng.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fred-Jones-and-Matthew-Weil.pdf

Earlier this year, Frederick Jones, along with a man named William Nichols bought a 70.9% stake in the shell company $TGLO. This sent the stock price soaring from .0001 to .03 and then another .27 soon after that once the news reached the ears of penny flippers who sought to slaughter the proverbial pig.

Since then, there has been wild speculation about the direction of the shell company with Delfin now at the helm. The most frequent speculative idea thrown about was that of the fabled Reverse Merger.

Now I can see some people leaving the room shaking their heads. And I know, I know. You're thinking it's too good to be true. And I thought so too but being the poor piece of dirt I am, I acquired a small manageable stake in the shell OTC $TGLO in February. Hoping to strike it rich, I decided to keep a close eye on this possible diamond in the rough.

And along the way, a few clues dropped out of the woodwork as well as some mysteries that are still unsolved thus far.

In their first report since the transaction in January, the shell released a filing that mentioned Delfin over 40+ times. Essentially, the filing was representative of Delfin as if they had already taken over the shell company with intent to use. But this was still speculation. Another factor that was noted by a team of individuals on a separate board was that in that same filing, there were clauses that mentioned NASDAQ listing requirements and compliance thereof. These were low in frequency and really amounted to not much more than an increase in speculation of what was to become of the shell.

This speculation was chaotic as one side said even if the company were to use the shell, they would only use it to raise money then drop it at an instant. Or that they would r/s the stock into oblivion and beyond with something akin to a 100:1 r/s leaving current shareholders holding the bag before the big bang.

The other side said there had to be something more to the whole thing and remained hopefully optimistic. They saw clippings of information bleeding through the pages of the filings. Coded legal speak that hinted at shares being held elsewhere out of reportable view. There were transactions between investors involved with TGLO and Delfin that seemed like equity trading hands. There are very few filings out for TGLO since the incident this past winter so I encourage you to read through and follow the development of the situation for yourself so as to contribute to the discussion.

But last week, something happened.

A form 4 was released stating that the interim CEO William Nichols of Fairwood LNG (previously the parent company of Delfin Midstream LLC) had resigned from his position and the Delfin CEO Fred Jones was to take his place.

In addition to this filing, we found out that Delfin Midstream LLC had changed its corporate status to a corporation and was now Delfin Midstream Inc.

This important detail allows Delfin to be a publicly traded company on a major exchange. Further building on the speculation that an uplisting is to occur at some point.

Finally, two new directors appeared in a form 13D that was filed last week. These two directors were men from Enbridge Energy (a Canadian energy investments company, worth looking up) and Talisman seen here:

https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/sec-filings/12848976/content/html

The rapid development leads some to believe that the RM super 8k announcement could be imminent. But again, this is purely speculative and definitely open to criticism. There is a lot more information out there about the supposed transaction between Enbridge and Michael Egan's fund (which amount to a 5% equity stake for around 22million shares at $3.75).


Now to the juicy fruit. What would happen if Delfin were to RM into the TGLO shell?

Assuming a modest to 0 ratio reverse split, we can speculate on the potential of a small investment in the OTC shares.

If we compare Delfin’s situation to its closest competitor in the industry, we can arrive at a fair valuation.

TELL set alarms off on some peoples radars a year and a half ago when they did a reverse merger of their own. They are still in the permitting process but have come up with a FID which I believe is to be financed in part by Golar LNG who will be helping to build the vessels for their LNG exports. I honestly haven’t read up too much on TELL but I do know that they have not acquired a permit for their exports and are still around 5-6 years off from making their first export voyage. TELL currently trades with a market cap of $2bil. At their peak, post RM, the market cap hit around $4.5billion.

Again, assuming we can compare the two companies based on their current situations, we can arrive at a similar valuation for Delfin.

Delfin has already acquired a permit for LNG export. Their permit is special however because Delfin is the only LNG export company that has permission from the United States DoE to export LNG to countries outside of a free-trade agreement with the US. This allows Delfin to reach a significantly larger global market than its competitors and to be honest, it’s hard to even place a value on a priceless permit such as theirs. To not be wildly over-optimistic, I won’t overinflate their valuation on this fact.

Delfin has also secured contracts with several countries already, two of the major players being China and Poland who combined provide about $10bil of future revenue to Delfin should their project be seen through as they would envision it.


Delfin is currently awaiting its FID but presuming that things go smoothly and are underway within the timeline they have set out thus far, I think it is fair to say that Delfin could reach at least the valuation of TELL. I believe they could easily double TELL’s peak valuation but even if they only reach a modest $2billion, the ROI of your shares if invested today could potentially net a 3,000% return. This is of course assuming there will be no r/s which there has been much discussion around. No one has a solid argument as to whether or not that will happen at any point but the general consensus is that if a r/s were to take place, they would need to dilute current shareholders to about 1/30th their current ownership which would nullify the return just mentioned.


I believe Delfin could reach a peak valuation initially of around $12billion. I think they have more contracts in their back pocket and since they have already secured some financing and now have Enbridge on their board of directors, I don’t see them having a problem financing the rest of the project through to completion in 2021/2022.

A $12 billion valuation would net a 18,500% return on shares owned today.




Will it happen? Probably not but if you’re looking for penny stocks it’s probably because you’re a degenerate hype suckler and this stock is looking like a story to tell one way or the other. There is plenty more information in the news and in filings about Delfin so I encourage you to read all of it before making any type of decision for yourself.



THIS IS ALL SPECULATION BASED ON INCOMPLETE INFORMATION.

The EnergyVIEW software application will use blockchain managed energy data at the wastewater facility

CHICAGO, July 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Epazz, Inc](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0fIgQKQ76oYaQfFTvyGdJNlzKFwHS5N9qpXs-Iz4Pk0cJ_w61g85dG_lO1iy-DwvzkfhwAJRuaw0ohy4t0eHrA==). (OTC: EPAZ), a leading provider of blockchain cryptocurrency mobile apps and cloud-based business software solutions, announced today that the company’s EnergyVIEW Wastewater Treatment Facility Software is being upgraded with blockchain technology. EnergyVIEW is an important automation component of Integrated Plant Management and Control systems.

Managing operations, laboratory, maintenance and regulatory data at Wisconsin Wastewater Treatment Facility originally involved repetitive and time consuming manual data entry. Many Wisconsin facilities were already using the IPMC MaintenanceVIEW and ReportVIEW solutions when a plant energy management project was proposed. The EnergyVIEW software application will use blockchain managed energy data at the wastewater facility. Blockchain uses a distributed ledger that demands accountability and accuracy, which prevents data tampering. The company is in the development process of upgrading EnergyVIEW. The customers will receive the upgrade as part of their annual subscription and support agreements.  

The energy efficiency improvements recently completed at the facility included the addition of instrumentation, high efficiency motors, variable frequency drives and EnergyVIEW energy management software. The software is configured with metering at each motor control center in the facility. Real-time and historical data is displayed and collected that will be submitted to a distributed ledger. EnergyVIEW provides smart energy metering and power measurement to accurately measure, store, and analyze energy data. Additional manual data on other energy sources is part of the same energy management application. The combination of metering hardware and software provides an end-to-end solution from real-time measurement to audits of the utility bills. The EnergyVIEW application improves the speed and quality of energy measurement information, so that the facility staff will be able to make better management decisions, conserve energy and reduce operating costs.

The EnergyVIEW program continuously collects data for processes, maintenance and energy data and stores it in central SQL databases. The system provides an engineering database with minimum, maximum, average and total statistical data, plus operational data for reporting. Administrative access provides the ability to create energy billing audit reports. The maintenance staff can use the system data for predictive maintenance reports and forensic analysis. Blockchain protects data input and output.

IPMC and EnergyVIEW are important tools to help facility staff verify and document the efficient operation of the Wastewater Facilities.

“There are hundreds of applications in which Blockchain can enhance our current cloud business solutions, as we upgrade our software programs we are creating new technologies,” said Shaun Passley, PhD, CEO of Epazz, Inc.

The Launch of MYFLIX requires two L.A. trips during July - plus one web-hosting visit to Seattle. The L.A. trip will also allow for some face-to-face meetings with key MYFLIX suppliers and other major studios that we are seeking to enlist. The aggressive Q3 / Q4 home video &amp; digital release slate for the HHSE / Medallion core distribution business will also benefit from direct meetings with key wholesalers and distribution partners in the L.A. metro. And of course, we anticipate one or more day trips during July to meet with the auditors (current Form 10 project), should issues requiring clarification not be easily resolved by calls or Skype.

Hannover's original production of the Period-Thriller, THE RIOT ACT, will likely be rescheduled for theatrical release in SEPTEMBER in order to access a retail cross promotion and a College / Universities support campaign. Previously, we had planned this title for theatrical launch on Aug. 24... but the mid-to-late September date is looking more interesting. HHSE / Medallion also have two other titles for theatrical release - both planned for OCTOBER (neither acquisition has yet been announced, so out of respect for the stature of the films, the company will announce the titles via separate wire-services press releases).

With all of this exciting activity and results, some current and prospective shareholders are asking about the HHSE stock and timing. Accordingly, we share with you below the summation of notes from large traders / professional funds that have been in communication with HHSE management over the past few months.

WHY IS THIS A GREAT TIME TO LOOK AT HHSE?

1). STABILITY - Company has been in business for 25-years (since 1993).

2). DIVERSITY - Original business of BOOK PUBLISHING evolved into DVD Distribution and now into THEATRICAL and INTERNATIONAL Distribution as market conditions changed.

3). NEW MEDIA - the new MYFLIX Venture into digital streaming (www.MyFlix.com), has over 30-studio and film library participants, collectively with over 10,000 feature films and television episodic hours of entertainment. This platform will have (literally) THOUSANDS of movies not available on any other streaming site. Less than ten years ago, NETFLIX was a mail order video rental business. NOW they are among the top movers and shakers in the entertainment industry DESPITE having a very limited selection of programming for viewers. We believe that MYFLIX could be a revolutionary new streaming destination - and a massive turning point for Hannover House.

4). STOCK REGISTRATION - HHSE is currently on the ""OTC-Pinksheets"" exchange. This status has impeded some large, institutional investors and hedge funds from buying into the stock. However, the pending Form 10 filing (including audits), will elevate the stock to the OTC:QB status as an initial step towards possible further up-listing. The OTC:QB status will open the door to significant new shareholders, which most professional traders and investors feel will dramatically improve the PPS and trading volume for HHSE.

5). NO STOCK ISSUANCES / NO DILUTION - HHSE has not issued any new shares in the past three years, and management has repeatedly stated that there are no plans to dilute shareholders through any deals now in motion or anticipated in the future.

6). PRESENTLY UNDER-VALUED PPS - Based on the Price-Earnings ratio for other publicly traded film / entertainment distributors, HHSE should be enjoying a 22X share price based on earnings. HHSE is on target to realize $1,250,000 in earnings for FYE 12-31-2018. This supports a share price of $.034 at present... and does not take into account the tremendous good-will and enthusiasm factor for the upcoming launch of MyFlix. Some highly respected stock analysts have communicated to HHSE management their prediction that the company's activities could support a share price of $.15 - which is more than ten-times current pricing. Even if their predictions are off by 75% - there is still an easily justifiable share price that is many times more than current trading levels.

7). TIMING-TIMING-TIMING - The launch of Myflix is a ""second generation"" site, in that the digital streaming technology and consumer acceptance have already been established. With that essential battle already won, MyFlix can concentrate on becoming ""the better mousetrap"" for digital entertainment. You combine this ideal market timing with the company's stock registration uplist, the presence of significant new shareholders post-registration, and new distribution pacts for the company's core film distribution activities (SONY / CINEDIGM), many feel that NOW is the ideal time to take a position in HHSE shares (while the HHSE Price Per Share is artificially low). Are these professional traders right? We will all know very soon!

HHSE makes no representation, guarantee or warranty that our share price will improve significantly as a result of these and other current activities. Every stock investment involves risks and factors outside of the control of issuers and management. But we proudly share with you the above information, projections and rationale' that professional traders have identified as the basis for why they believe that NOW is a great time to look at HHSE.

IamMat;1531414879;8ybkha;;7;;15;" **Intermap Technologies Reports Expanded U.S. Government Task Order, NGA contract selection**   


DENVER, July 12, 2018   


DENVER, July 12, 2018 /CNW/ - (TSX: IMP) (ITMSF:BB) – Intermap Technologies Corporation (""Intermap"" or the ""Company"") announced today that it has been awarded two additional task orders totaling $2.5 million as expansion to its previously announced U.S. Government task orders for the creation of digital elevation and bare earth terrain models. The original task order for $1.8 million was announced on February 6, 2018 and previously extended to $3.7 million on February 22, 2018. **Today's expansion brings the total 2018 contracted value to $6.2 million.**   


Separately, Intermap announced today that it was selected by National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's (NGA) as a member of the CACI International Inc team (Team CACI) to **develop, validate and integrate geospatial intelligence data, under a $920 million ceiling, multi-award, Janus Geography contract.** The prime contract was awarded to CACI International as one of 10 prime contractors for indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity through 2028. The 10-year program will support the creation, validation, enrichment and integration of foundation geospatial intelligence data.   


In addition, at the special request of the Thai government, Intermap provided our newest and highest quality global one meter digital elevation model, NEXTMap One, to the team leading the search effort for the thirteen members of the youth soccer team that went missing in a cave in Northern Thailand on June 23, 2018. The NEXTMap One DEM was used in connection with known cave patterns to assist in determining the best-available access points and drainage for drilling locations. A high-resolution terrain model was delivered for use in visualizing and navigating during rescue mission operations within hours of the government's initial request on June 27, 2018. Three dimensional models based on NEXTMap One were prepared by Intermap, MappointAsia Thailand Public Co. Ltd. along with Chiang Mai University and disseminated to Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation officials, and used to help locate the missing children and plan for their eventual extraction from the cave.   


""We'd like to congratulate the international rescue operation, the Thai Navy SEALs and the emergency responders in Thailand on their success in locating the boys and bringing them to safety. We are saddened by the loss of former Thai Navy SEAL, Saman Kunont. Intermap was pleased to assist Thai officials and searchers to gain a better understanding of where the missing boys might be and safely extract them from the cave. It is a great example of how geospatial data and building awareness of its capabilities can bring about tremendous results."" commented Patrick Blott, Chairman &amp; CEO of Intermap.

SofaKingNatty;1531481719;8yj7hi;;1;;1;"Wondering if anyone has any experience with, or DD on this company? My dad sent me this article [https://cropcorp.com/crop-tenant-plants-additional-20000-square-feet-of-recreational-cannabis-in-california-and-announces-first-harvest/](https://cropcorp.com/crop-tenant-plants-additional-20000-square-feet-of-recreational-cannabis-in-california-and-announces-first-harvest/) and I haven't had time to dig in, but at first brush:

* It's more of a brick &amp; mortar play with a cannabis spin - great for investors who are familiar with real estate and want some exposure to cannabis growth &amp; returns
* As a long-term investor in AP.UN (Allied REIT) I've always loved Allied because it's a nice real estate + tech play - Allied is the #1 most popular landlord among tech tenants in Canada, and they have their own class of office space. I feel like CROP could be a similar style of industry exposure.
* It seems like a ""selling pickaxes during the gold-rush"" style model
* I like the brick &amp; mortar play because of the stability of real estate 
* The model also looks sort of like ""contract brewing"" which happens a lot in the beer space for new brewery start-ups. 
* My only issue is I'm not sure how well-suited cannabis is for the aforementioned models because most LP's are able to  raise enough capital for infrastructure. Perhaps CROP will fill a gap on a per-state basis to infill, or perhaps they will be a resource which large LP's allocate to when they can't meet volume demands.

SSAInvesting;1531836911;8zlhc0;;2;;19;"    Peer-reviewed article published in Journal of Pharmaceutical Science evaluates skin tolerability and bioavailability of ADAM’s intracutaneous zolmitriptan delivery

FREMONT, Calif., July 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zosano Pharma (ZSAN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing targeted therapies that deliver rapid systemic absorption using a novel and proprietary technology called Adhesive Dermally-Applied Microarray (“ADAM™”) with the potential to transform patient lives and advance patient care, today announced the recent publication of a peer-reviewed paper regarding ADAM technology for the delivery of zolmitriptan in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Science.  

“This study enabled us to understand the delivery and tolerability of M207 in a nonclinical setting so as to aid us in setting reasonable expectations of our platform when studying in human subjects,” said Hayley Lewis, senior vice president, operations at Zosano Pharma. “The results from this animal study add to a growing body of evidence which indicate that absorption through the epidermis or dermis seems to be a suitable delivery platform for products that have limitations when delivered orally.”

In vivo studies were conducted in pigs using ADAM 1.9-mg zolmitriptan. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the ADAM 1.9-mg zolmitriptan was delivered with high efficiency (85%) and high absolute bioavailability (77%). Furthermore, in vivo evaluation showed a rapid systemic absorption with a median Tmax of 15 min. These results provided validation to advance the development of ADAM zolmitriptan.

About M207

M207 is our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan delivered utilizing Zosano's proprietary ADAM technology.  Zosano's ADAM technology consists of titanium microprojections coated with drug, and in the case of M207, our formulation of zolmitriptan.  The drug-coated microneedles physically break through the stratum corneum and penetrate into the epidermis and dermis, where the dry drug coating is dissolved by the surrounding skin interstitial fluid.  In February 2017, the Company announced statistically significant results from the ZOTRIP pivotal study, which demonstrated that the 3.8mg dose of M207 met both co-primary endpoints, achieving pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom at 2 hours.  In November 2017, the Company announced the initiation of its long-term safety study evaluating M207 and expects to file an NDA for M207 in the fourth quarter of 2019.";59279;ZSAN is up 12% This Morning on the Following News:;

smallcapsteve;1531844478;8zmjwy;;0;;7;" ""Back of the Napkin"", using the NAL dykes and what leads onto Vallee from 2011 drill results. I am happy to assume 3MT of lithium. Much of it near the surface. If you are inclined to price the stock based on the size of that resource you are looking at 25c-45c depending on the multiple you want to use (5-10x per MT). But the truth is, the cataylst will be much nicer: **Cashflows.**  


Under the small mine act, there should be enough lithum in Vallee to give us 3 years of production (2M MT/2000 MT per day = approx 1000 days). Thats without finding anything new. Which they will. And also a very conservative number on the back of the napkin.  


Why isn't this stock more promoted? Because they are still executing a pioneer type plan and acquiring more claims in the area. This tiny little nanocap, is actually building up a tremendous plan to generate cash flows and prove out a gigantic resource.  


For me personally, today's news indicates that the first time I talked to Michael on the phone in Feb 2018, everything he has said to me is accurate. When you look at the size of NAL's resource and what Sayona has on the other side. It is clear there are dykes running in the land Michael picked up. The guy is a former senior geologist with Goldcorp, he knows a thing or two.  


Anyways, you can sell because you aren't happy with the markets reaction. But the truth is, JOR doesn't care about promoting the stock yet. When the time is right, there will be a tour to around bay street and guess what? They will eat this story up. They are building out the Pilbara of Canada. With CATL's involvement next door, you can bet Bay Street will catch onto this story.  


Right now is like the seed round of financing. You get in and you make 10x your money or you get in and it doesn't work out very well. I'm betting heavy on Michael.  


I am sitting on the bid today. For two reasons, 1) everything Michael has said to me since the start has turned out to be true 2) the recent news that Sayona is making major strides in executing this plan a few kms over.

jameson62;1532005882;905pra;;5;;1;"Following this company for awhile now. I'm VERY curious to see which company they're going to be doing this with...""Major Pharmaceutical Company""

GT Biopharma Inc. (GTBP) and (Euronext Paris: GTBP.PA) announced today a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) between a Major Pharmaceutical Company and Dr. Daniel Vallera, Director, Section of Molecular Cancer Therapeutics at the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota.

Under the terms of the agreement, this Major Pharmaceutical Company will supply a formulation of their multibillion dollar, widely prescribed oncology drug, which has been approved for use in several hematologic malignancies to Dr. Vallera to be used in this study.

Dr. Vallera is the lead researcher for GT Biopharma’s bispecific antibody drug conjugate (ADC) program, and the innovator of oncology drug candidate DT2219, also known as OXS-1550. OXS-1550 targets two antigens on cancer cells and contains a cytotoxic payload thereby increasing the probability it will kill the cancer cells. OXS-1550 targets cancer cells expressing the CD19 receptor and/or CD22 receptors which includes B-cell leukemias and lymphomas and has a modified form of diphtheria toxin (DT390) as its cytotoxic drug payload. After OXS-1550 binds to cancer cells, it is taken in by the cancer cells and subsequently deploy its cytotoxic diphtheria toxin payload which inhibits protein synthesis and kills the cancer cells.

Initial pre-clinical work performed by Dr. Vallera suggests a much greater effect when OXS-1550 is given in combination with this established oncology drug. Dr. Vallera said: “I am looking forward to conducting these experiments. Early work suggests that these two agents would be a great combination in the treatment of certain cancers. This initial work will assist us in deciding what tumors to target and the doses to employ.”

GT Biopharma’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr. Raymond Urbanski said: “This is a tremendous step forward for the OXS-1550 program. Pre-clinical data suggests that the combination of OXS-1550 and this agent is highly potent against certain tumor cell lines. This MTA will allow further studies in animal models to both confirm the effects as well as ascertain which tumor types are the most susceptible to this potent combination.”

## Access to UCONN's technology could create the potential for HPPI to expand its pipeline of clinical stage itraconazole-based cancer treatments

PR Newswire

TAMPA, Fla., July 19, 2018

TAMPA, Fla., July 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- HedgePath Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB: HPPI), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and plans to commercialize innovative therapeutics for patients with cancer, announced today that it has signed an exclusive option agreement with the University of Connecticut (UConn) related to patents and patent applications covering certain chemical analogues of the FDA-approved anti-fungal drug itraconazole.  

A patented formation of itraconazole licensed by HPPI is the active ingredient in HPPI's existing lead product candidate, and having access to UConn's technology could create the potential for HPPI to expand its developmental pipeline of clinical stage itraconazole-based treatments for certain cancers.

The option agreement, which goes into effect on August 1, 2018, is for an exclusive option period of six (6) months, which is extendible to twelve (12) months.  The optioned field of use includes all therapeutic, prophylactic, and diagnostic uses for cancerous and non-cancerous cell proliferation disorders in humans.   During the term of exclusivity, UConn will not offer third parties the opportunity to license the patent portfolio within this field of use.  

The itraconazole analogues, which are being developed by Dr. M. Kyle Hadden, Associate Professor of Medicinal Chemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at UConn, have modifications to particular regions of the itraconazole scaffold.  The patents and patent applications include compositions of matter claims covering the itraconazole analogues and method claims covering their use for the treatment of cancer.  Data from Dr. Hadden's laboratory suggest that certain of these analogues maintain potent Hedgehog Pathway inhibition while exhibiting improved pharmacokinetic parameters and reduced off-target side effects sometimes associated with itraconazole.  Of particular interest to HPPI are two U.S. patents issued to UConn in May and December of 2017 regarding itraconazole analogues and their methods of use. 

Nicholas J. Virca, HPPI's President and CEO, stated ""We are excited to enter into this option agreement with UConnand to collaborate with Dr. Hadden's lab to study the potential anti-cancer properties of these analogues on a pre-clinical basis.  This effort is intended to help us determine the potential for these analogues as new itraconazole-based drugs which inhibit the Hedgehog Pathway in human cells.  The formulations of these analogues may also reduce the concern regarding the associated use of many other drugs that are contraindicated for patients being dosed with itraconazole.  This effort by UConn is synergistic with HPPI's regulatory strategy to repurpose itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy and has the potential to lead to the development of the next generation of itraconazole therapies for HPPI.""  

**About HedgePath Pharmaceuticals**

HedgePath Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB:HPPI) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that is seeking to repurpose the FDA approved antifungal pharmaceutical itraconazole as a potential treatment for cancer. In addition to rights associated with the Option Agreement with UConn for its itraconazole analogues, HPPI is the exclusive U.S. licensee of Mayne Pharma (HPPI's majority stockholder) of a patented formulation of itraconazole, called SUBA™-Itraconazole, which clinical studies have shown to have greater bioavailability than generic itraconazole. 

**About the** University of Connecticut

The University of Connecticut is one of the top 25 public research universities in the nation and is a research leader in the fields of advanced materials, additive manufacturing, biomedical devices, cybersecurity, energy, life sciences, sensors, and nanotechnology.  As Connecticut's flagship institution of higher education, UConn serves as an important resource for Connecticut economic development and is dedicated to building collaborations with industry and entrepreneurs with more than $3.6B in investment from the state of Connecticut and industry partners.

**About the Hedgehog Pathway**

The Hedgehog signaling pathway is a major regulator of cellular processes in vertebrates, including cell differentiation, tissue polarity and cell proliferation. Based on published research, HPPI believes that inhibiting the Hedgehog pathway could delay or possibly prevent the development of certain cancers in humans.

hackpennystocks;1532421551;91fmys;;6;;65;"Here's the list that I complied from my personal stock pick generator. I've been trading penny stocks for over 8 years and my goal is to help others make money. I hate seeing people lose money in penny stocks so I am distributing my penny stock picks/advice. Here's a list of momentum stocks:

DDE - Some traders think this stock is heading higher, but failed to understand the catalyst. This stock was part of an M&amp;A deal so the stock price has already been determined. Leave it alone because it's not going anywhere.

HCLP - The stop loss is around $13.20 and the stock hit my divisible by 5 level @ $14.00 even then came crashing back down. Think that was a coincidence? Nope...that's how penny stocks and lower small cap stocks function...it's about psychology.

CUR - This one also hit a divisible by 5 level at $1.50 and then came back down. Making money isn't the only way to stay profitable in penny stocks. You also need to know when to cut your losses when you're wrong. If you understand these levels they could help you substantially cut your losses.

AMPE - This stock closed near a divisible by 5 level at $3.00, so expect some volatility. The resistance is at $3.13 so if price can sustain a level above, it could be a nice b/o.

supernova2020;1532671513;92a0lp;News;0;;2;"This editorial piece from Tirias Research (Forbes contributor) discusses the significance KULR Technology's (OTC: KUTG) Carbon Fiber Cooling technology (CFC or carbon velvet):

KULR Carbon Velvet Enables Cooler Digital Gear

Managing heat has been a growing concern in consumer electronics as performance increases, form factors shrink and applications push mobile design requirements. As a result, designing systems to manage heat has become an art of balancing endless trade-offs, as demonstrated by the recent Samsung Galaxy Note 7 issues. However, KULR Technology is introducing a flexible carbon fiber heat sink that may eliminate many of the design trade-offs, while enabling a new generation of electronic form factors.

When first approached about the concept of using carbon fiber in consumer electronics, my first thought was using it as the case, which has already been done. What KULR is doing is completely different. KULR has developed a velvet material made from carbon fibers. Not only does carbon fiber have higher tensile strength than steel when combined with epoxies or resins, it also has incredible heat conducting properties, making it a natural heat sink. When you combine vertical strands of carbon fiber into a velvet-like material, you create a heat sink that has a larger surface area. A larger surface area means that carbon fiber-based materials can dissipate more heat than traditional metal heat sinks.

KULR calls the material carbon velvet. The resulting heat sink or thermal interface material is called FTI. FTI is flexible in both its composition and application. KULR can change the length and density of the fibers in its carbon velvet to change the heat transfer characteristics and cost. In application, the material can mold to a circuit board and its chips like a blanket. In addition to dissipating heat, this blanket also reduces the design requirements associated with traditional heat sinks, and eases the assembly of the final product.

The flexible nature of the carbon velvet allows for creative product form factors, such as devices that mold to body parts. In talking to the KULR technical staff about the technology, it is also easy to see how the carbon velvet could be adapted to an almost endless list of applications ranging from augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) headsets to servers, electric vehicles, and renewable energy applications.

Carbon fiber heat transfer technology is not new. It was originally developed over two decades ago for extremely demanding applications that could absorb the expense, including aerospace and industrial equipment. KULR’s proprietary manufacturing process is the enabling factor for wider adoption of carbon velvet technology. KULR can manufacture carbon velvet at competitive price points for many applications that might not have considered carbon fiber heat transfer solutions.

Over the past year they have been making a massive turnaround. Company has submitted documents and filings to get re-registered on OTCMarkets. They are just waiting for the filings to post, which could happen at any minute. This would bring them current and have a big impact on share price (IMO). 

Check it out, might still have some time but filings could come at any moment. 

All of this is in my opinion so please do your research first. ";60359;$INTK (Industrial Nanotech) - Now is the time to get in!;

SMA5HN1;1532720999;92fqgv;;44;;28;"Hello everyone. 

I royally screwed the pooch on this one. 

Long story short.. I played my first penny stock about 3 years ago. I did EXTREMELY well on this play making about $150,000 during the hype of the stock. Because i was new at this, and it being my first play, I didn't really know when i should take my money out. I compared the company to other companies that were similar and decided that i would hold long-term as i think the stock will keep growing (compared to the price of competitors in the same space). I now know that just because a competitors stock price is higher, doesn't make it more valuable. The underlying factor that i learned is that in this arena, share structure is huge. The ticker ended up bottoming out after some time, and i actually lost money on this play. Worst mistake of my life so far.. 

Well, i figured if i did that on my first play, i should try again and just pull out when the stock got high enough instead of just leaving it alone. This was a good plan until i realized that i suck at pulling my money out. I hastily admit that i easily get greedy and when i see myself making so much money, i never want to take it out. This is my problem. I am stuck holding the bag on about 10 tickers that have completely bottomed out. Very low volume, some of them have large SS making them almost impossible to move, etc.. I am down about $20,000 and dont know what to do. I havent sold any of my shares yet because nobody will buy them. The small amount of money that i still have in the account have pretty much been wrote off and that i am not getting it back. This is obviously a very costly mistake on my part, but is there any hope? Are there any ways that i can get my money back? Would you continue to hold, or just put a long term sell order in and cut my losses when the order fills?

Any advice is hugely helpful, thanks in advance! ";60420;I messed up, need some advice.;

***Kuvera Startups Showing Early Growth***

**SALT LAKE CITY, UT / ACCESSWIRE / July 31, 2018 /** Investview Corporation (OTCQB: INVU) through its wholly owned subsidiary Kuvera LLC sees early growth in companies featured in their unique product called Kuvera Startups.

📷

Kuvera Startups helps an individual navigate the enormous market of equity crowdfunding. Kuvera's Market Expert Michael Markowski researches companies in the equity crowdfunding arena and provides Kuvera customers key financial information and research for their consideration.

StartEngine, an early Kuvera Startups selection shows tangible growth in value.

*""The share price of StartEngine, the first company added to Kuvera Startups at the end of 2017 has increased by 100%. After the $5 per share offering closed in June, StartEngine immediately announced its intention to launch another offering at $10 per share. The increase is best attributed to StartEngine's cryptocurrency infrastructure,""* said Michael Markowski, Kuvera's Market Expert.

ChoiceTrade, an on-line broker that was added to the Kuvera portfolio on May 17th, 2018 may follow the same trajectory as StartEngine as it has announced its plan for adding crypto infrastructure services. Choicetrade is available at $1.50 per share with a minimum investment of $99 through the Netcapital crowdfunding platform.

*Michael Markowski added, ""Choicetrade is positioning itself to be the Ameritrade of Cryptocurrency."" See Trophy Investing article of June 4th, 2018:* [http://trophyinvesting.com/could-the-ameritrade-of-crypto-potentially-be-choicetrade/](http://pr.report/dASDEHyN)

*Kuvera customers are provided comprehensive research and financial information on the companies selected for the Kuvera Startups portfolio aiding them in their crowdfunding analysis.*

*""Kuvera Startups is one of my favorite products because it provides me the opportunity to have access to key information on new companies in the market with exciting potential. In the past only those with a huge net-worth were able to participate. I believe this is information that could literally be worth over a million dollars,""* said Priscilla del Rayo Lopez, Kuvera Startups customer.

ATLANTA, July 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Incumaker, Inc. (OTC Pink: QMKR) is providing this  shareholder update on the progress of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with uBid Holdings Inc. (“UBID”). As previously announced, UBID agreed to merge with and into Incumaker and have Incumaker be the surviving corporation. Under this Alternative Public Offering, or “APO” transaction, shareholders of UBID will own 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of the newly combined company.  The Company will seek to change its name to “uBid Holdings Inc.” as well as its ticker symbol post-merger to better reflect the company’s new technology related business model.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, UBID’s current officers and directors would become the officers and directors of the newly combined company.  


Under the initial terms of the prior Agreement and Plan of Merger, Incumaker and UBID were to close the merger by May 31, 2018, which was extended to July 31, 2018. The closing of the transaction is subject to UBID completing the acquisition of Sky Auction and having the financing to consummate a second acquisition, and other customary conditions, including approval by the shareholders of both companies.

Ketan Thakker, UBID’s Chief Executive Officer, stated: “We are disappointed that that the merger timeline was not met but the audits have been more complex than expected.  We are pleased to announce, however, that as of July 31st, these audits have been completed. The completion of these PCOAB audits along with Incumaker currently being PCOAB audited are necessary steps to up-list to the OTCQB market, which we intend to do.”

“We remain excited about the planned merger and our focus continues to be taking the necessary steps to close the contemplated transaction,” Both companies have agreed to mutually extend the Merger timeline. We are working daily to complete the needed steps to consummate this merger as soon as possible.” Darren Bankston, CEO of Incumaker, commented.

from the New description we can read ""

and all My DD was about if RSHN will produce industrial Hemp(for CBD production) to serve all POTN products and the whole market !!! 


and the answer came today in a much bigger way than i anticipated because RSHN also own CBD production facilities as part of its joint venture. 

we are talking about a HUGE play here especially with the HEMP legalization that is happening just now in USA !! 

RSHN will be right in it as CBD production is all about industrial HEMP !!! 

and POTN is already buying imported HEMP !!! so by having CBD production in RSHN POTN will reduce dramatically its production costs and will register higher profits !!! 

and of course RSHN will sell them all the CBD they need !!!! 


the more POTN will make $$$ the more RSHN will do too $$$

The 2018 CubeSat “Lunar Flashlight” mission will use a laser to explore water ice hidden in shadows and craters on the moon surface. It will be the first NASA and JPL mission to use the smaller, lighter, less expensive satellites known as CubeSats to orbit the moon. 

“The use of these small CubeSats and exceptionally sensitive laser instruments to explore places such as lunar craters is a new and exciting kind of mission,” said KULR Technology’s CTO, Dr. Timothy Knowles, who has worked on NASA projects for decades. “And our technology, our heat sink, will keep the laser – the flashlight – from getting too hot and complicating or even corrupting the entire mission,” he said. 

During the 2020 Mars Mission, SHERLOC will be mounted on the rover's robotic arm and use spectrometers, a laser, and a camera to search for organics and minerals that may be signs of past microbial life. 

“The SHERLOC rover mission is literally the search for signs of extra-terrestrial life,” Knowles said. “That’s pretty exciting, but it also means that you have to be sure the equipment is performing as it should in ideal temperature ranges. Like the Lunar Flashlight mission, that’s what we can do.” 

The innovative KULR design included in the “Lunar Flashlight” and “SHERLOC” projects is a unique and highly effective phase-change system that incorporates KULR’s proprietary, highly conductive vertical carbon fiber architecture with a material similar to wax that can change from solid to liquid while absorbing high amounts of heat energy. The combination of materials designed and assembled by KULR to exact specifications will draw heat safely away from sensors and other components needed to efficiently study lunar ice formations or scan for signs of life on Mars. 

“For the Lunar mission, if the Flashlight laser gets above 24 Celsius the data can degrade -- jeopardizing the entire point of the mission,” Dr. Knowles said. “So, keeping it below 24 Celsius while the laser is spewing out heat at more than 100 Celsius is the trick. It’s like frying a hamburger and keeping the outside of the pan cool enough to touch – it’s not easy, but, in this case, very important.” 

For the Mars mission, a pair of KULR heat sinks are designed to accept 5400 Joules of heat over an hour operating time while keeping the temperature of the spectrometer detector within design limits. All the components, including the KULR sinks, will be expected to last at least one Mars year – about 687 days on Earth. 

For the CubeSat Flashlight and Mars Rover, KULR Technology will help keep mission-sensitive materials cool. But that’s not what KULR does exclusively. For the 2017 NASA NICER mission which explored deep space neutron stars, for example, KULR designed a system to keep the components from freezing during space exposure. Over years of work Knowles and his team at KULR have designed more than 100 different heat management configurations for NASA and other aerospace and commercial customers. According to Dr. Knowles, “Everything from solutions as big as a briefcase to ones as small as a quarter. If you need to manage heat energy during space exploration around sensitive electronics like lasers or optics, we can probably help.” 

“The KULR team has been an essential part of many of our projects in the last two decades,” said Mike Pauken, Spacecraft Thermal Systems Engineer at the Jet Propulsion Lab. “We’re happy to be working with them and incorporating their thermal solutions as part of the SHERLOC Instrument on the upcoming Mars 2020 Rover Mission.” 

KULR Technology’s core technology is vertically-aligned carbon fiber material that is lighter, more flexible, and more efficient than traditional thermal management products. KULR’s carbon fiber has virtually unlimited commercial and industrial applications in areas such as increasing the longevity of electronic components, maximizing the efficiency of energy storage, and contributing to the development and efficiency of electric vehicles and drones. 

Among the more promising uses for KULR’s carbon fiber is dramatically improving battery safety. KULR, in development and testing with a NASA, has developed a thermal shield that can prevent dangerous lithium-ion battery fires and explosions due to thermal runaway. In March, KULR announced an agreement with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, to be the exclusive manufacturing partner of the Internal Short-Circuit (ISC) device that can cause predictable lithium-ion cell failures in controlled conditions. 

The CubeSat “Lunar Flashlight” mission is set for launch in November 2018. The Mars 2020 mission is scheduled to launch in July or August 2020.

supernova2020;1533485168;94swrs;News;0;;8;"NASA’s Work to Head Off Battery Blazes in Space Finds Uses on Earth

July 21, 2017 By Andy Pasztor

NASA’s Work to Head Off Battery Blazes in Space Finds Uses on Earth Technology to prevent lithium-ion battery fires will be used in home robots, audio gear and other electronics 
 
NASA research to prevent catastrophic fires in vehicles or space suits in orbit soon is expected to make personal robots, audio gear and other electronics safer on the ground. 
 
Researchers, regulators and some electronics makers say the space agency is developing some of the most promising solutions to keep lithium-ion power packs from overheating and sparking fires. Working with closely held Kulr Technology Corp., the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is developing systems that wedge heat-absorbing carbon-fiber materials and even tiny water reservoirs between the cells to head off blazes. 
 
NASA’s initial goal was to prevent fiery accidents in orbit from lithium-battery malfunctions in space suits. The first modified suits are scheduled to be sent to the international space station in coming months. Future electric planes and unmanned Mars rovers likely will get later versions of the technology. 
The fire-prevention designs under development by NASA and Kulr aren’t meant for laptops or smartphones, but they are set to be used in consumer products such as centralized home audio controls and Ubtech Robotics Corp.’s Lynx, a new humanoid robot. Lynx features Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa digital assistant and is slated to go on sale this summer. 
 
Ubtech, a fast-growing Chinese robot maker, is in the final stages of testing the Lynx robots, which will offer facial recognition abilities and personalized greetings, along with other features available on Amazon’s wi-fi connected Echo speakers. Goti Deng, closely held Ubtech’s chief strategy officer, said the “demands for battery performance are really high,” but “right now Kulr is a star” in finding ways to reduce chances of dangerous overheating. 
 
Ubtech already relies on Kulr to safeguard robots sold by major U.S. retailers such as Best Buy Co. and Costco Wholesale Corp. By early 2018, Mr. Goti said, his company also plans to incorporate more-capable cooling technology in its next-generation robots intended for airports and museums. 
 
 
 
Kulr Chief Executive Michael Mo said the company is far enough along to start assessing commercial applications for products ranging from medical devices to drones to electrical systems on airliners. The company also has signed a wide-ranging marketing deal with Jabil Circuits Inc., a manufacturer of electronic products for customers such as International Business Machines Corp. , HP Inc. and Xerox Corp. 
 
“Battery technology has outpaced thermal-protection technology,” said Keith Cochran, Jabil vice president of global business units, who added Kulr’s technology “is very credible and the products work.” He said he expected Jabil to showcase Kulr’s technology in a line of home audio-control equipment within a few months. 
 
Lithium power packs installed in robots, lights and some appliances are growing more powerful. They pose increasing challenges for fire-suppression systems, particularly for shipments that burst into flames in cargo holds of airplanes. Fires hot enough to melt aluminum fuselages—and sparked or fed by large shipments of lithium batteries—destroyed 
three large jets over the past decade. Each year dozens of emergencies and diversions prompted by smoldering or flaming laptops in airliner cabins are reported world-wide. 
 
Against this backdrop, NASA’s research is attracting attention from other federal agencies. Battery experts from the Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration have requested details of certain laboratory techniques, said Eric Darcy, a top NASA battery expert. 
 
For NASA, which describes Kulr’s approach as “very promising,” having a variety of cooling options is important to ensure safe power in different types of hardware, including portions of the aging space station and solar-arrays under development. 
 
“I don’t think there is anyone else doing the testing that we’re doing,” Mr. Darcy said. Prompted by a pair of high-profile lithium-battery fires on Boeing Co. 787 jetliners in 2013, NASA decided to see if it could reduce the hazards of such malfunctions so “they wouldn’t be catastrophic events” in orbit, Mr. Darcy said. 
 
Kulr’s Mr. Mo and his management team predict they will get a jump on competitors because their technology aims to make batteries only 5% heavier, compared with current technology that adds 15% to 20% in weight. 
 
By encapsulating water in specially treated carbon-fiber based pockets, the company has been able to keep cell temperatures below 158 degrees Fahrenheit even when an adjoining test cell’s temperature climbed to about 1,000 degrees in one 2016 test cited by NASA. Recent lab results have been even more favorable, according to company test summaries.

FDA has confirmed HPPI's clinical and regulatory pathway for SUBA BCCNS and provided further guidance for anticipated NDA submission

PR Newswire

TAMPA, Fla., Aug. 6, 2018

TAMPA, Fla., Aug. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- HedgePath Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB:HPPI), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and plans to commercialize innovative therapeutics for patients with cancer, announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has confirmed HPPI's current clinical and regulatory pathway related to HPPI's SUBA™-Itraconazole as a treatment for Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) in patients with Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome (BCCNS, also known as Gorlin Syndrome).  FDA's positive feedback was received at HPPI's previously announced July 23rd Type-C Meeting with FDA and  was confirmed in minutes of the meeting received by HPPI from FDA.

📷

Based on this feedback, HPPI as has filed a Pre-NDA Meeting Request with FDA as a next step toward the anticipated filing of HPPI's New Drug Application (NDA) for SUBA BCCNS during 2018.

Nicholas J. Virca, HPPI's President &amp; CEO, stated ""Based upon the positive exchange with FDA attendees during our Type-C Meeting and the publication of meeting minutes by the FDA only a few days later, we believe we have reached a better understanding with FDA regarding the reporting of our efficacy and safety results from our Phase 2(b) open label trial for SUBA BCCNS.  We are also encouraged by the FDA's guidance concerning the other requirements for our anticipated NDA submission under the 505(b)(2) pathway.  Based on these developments, we have submitted a Pre-NDA Meeting Request seeking an additional confirmatory meeting with FDA before the planned filing of our NDA for SUBA BCCNS later this year.""

Readers are cautioned that no assurances can be given that the clinical study referenced herein will be found by FDA to be sufficient for an NDA filing or, even if the NDA is accepted for filing, that the NDA will be ultimately be approved by FDA.  

**About SUBA-Itraconazole** 

HPPI's lead drug candidate, SUBA-Itraconazole, is a patent-protected formulation of itraconazole, an approved oral antifungal drug that has been in use for over 25 years.  HPPI is the exclusive U.S. licensee (through Mayne Pharma, the majority stockholder of HPPI) of SUBA-Itraconazole for the treatment of cancer.  Prior to research at Johns Hopkins University, itraconazole was not known to have any target in mammalian cells. Investigators at Johns Hopkins discovered that itraconazole inhibits the hedgehog pathway by binding to a surface receptor in the pathway called Smoothened.  Unlike generic itraconazole, that has poor and unpredictable bioavailability, SUBA-Itraconazole can be dosed at half the level of the generic formulation due to its superior bioavailability, which exceeds 90%.  As such, HPPI believes that generic itraconazole cannot be substituted for SUBA-Itraconazole.

**About BCCNS**

HPPI's initial indication is for the orphan disease BCCNS. SUBA-Itraconazole has qualified under the FDA's Orphan Drug Designation Program as a potential therapy for BCCNS.  There is no approved pharmaceutical therapy for this familial cancer syndrome.  There are estimated to be 10,000 patients in the U.S. with BCCNS.  This is an autosomal dominantly inherited defect in the hedgehog pathway that causes the pathway to be up-regulated, resulting in hundreds or even thousands of basal cell carcinomas developing over the lifetime of the affected patients.  In many types of cancers, the hedgehog pathway is basically hijacked by the cancer cells to assist their growth and metastatic spread, but in the case of basal cell carcinomas, whether in this hereditary syndrome or in the much more common, sporadic basal cell carcinomas, the hedgehog pathway has a mutation that makes it the sole driver of the development of BCC tumors.  Inhibition of the pathway, then, can inhibit the appearance of new tumors, shrink existing tumors, and even cause some tumors to disappear altogether.

**Highlights of the Transaction:**

* Strategic portfolio of **2 granted mining leases** and **3 granted exploration licenses** (146.80 km2).
* Mining leases provide the potential for immediate large scale bulk sampling of mineralization. The 2 granted mining leases add to the 5 granted mining leases from the Friendly Creek transaction announced May 28, 2018.
* **2.3 km of strike of the contact between Hardey Formation and Mount Roe Basalt occurs within the Boodalyerrie Project.**

SEATTLE, Aug. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NetworkWire – SinglePoint Inc. (OTC:SING) provides overall company update including revenue, Form 10, acquisitions. SinglePoint over the past year has been able to successfully integrate its acquisitions and reported revenues of over $188,000 for the first quarter of 2018, which represents a significant increase as compared to the first quarter of 2017.  This revenue increase has been generated by successful acquisitions continuing to grow and operate, including DIGS and JAG. Acquisitions have been a key factor in starting to build a solid financial base and we intend to continue to grow the company. We hope that our growth will continue both organically and with larger investments and or acquisitions which can further solidify our financial position.  


“We built a solid base throughout 2017 and have been building upon that in 2018 which has led to SinglePoint starting to generate a major increase in revenue compared to previous years. We are looking to acquire companies that are cash flow positive. This will give SinglePoint the ability to operate and continue taking risks in hyper growth opportunities”, states Greg Lambrecht CEO.

We believe that our recently filed Form 10-12G with the SEC will provide more transparency and credibility which will open doors to future growth. SinglePoint is hopeful that with these new opportunities the company can continue to build shareholder value and long-term appreciation, through marketing and sales of current suite of services as well as acquisitions.

New York, NY, Aug. 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Recall Studios (OTC: “BTOP”) today announced it successfully completed the acquisition of Evolution AI Corporation, an artificial intelligence technology company engaged in the development of hyper-realistic human animation technology to enable leading Artificial Intelligence platforms to interact with consumers in a relatable human form. The acquisition also includes Evolution AI Corporation’s majority stake in Pulse Evolution Corporation (OTC: “PLFX”), a globally recognized pioneer in the development of hyper-realistic digital humans for live shows, virtual reality, augmented reality, holographic, 3D stereoscopic, web, mobile, interactive and artificial intelligence applications.

Under the terms of the transaction, to be more fully described in the Company’s forthcoming 8-K filing, Recall Studios issued approximately $200 million in common stock equivalent securities to Evolution AI Corporation shareholders in exchange for substantially all of the common stock of Evolution AI Corporation.  The acquisition also includes 150 million common share equivalents, or an approximate 60% ownership interest, of Pulse Evolution Corporation and marks the first major milestone in Recall’s completion of its previously announced $1.38 per share tender offer to acquire the remaining publicly floated shares of Pulse Evolution.

Commenting on the acquisition, Recall Chairman Alexander Bafer stated, “With impressive new VR technology patents in process, and commercial applications in AR underway, the purchase of Evolution AI and Pulse Evolution helps us to complete the picture. Our combined companies will stand uniquely among the industry’s first vertically integrated Mixed-Reality companies, from IP-owner to Content Creator to Applications Provider.”

Recall Studios is committed to the development and exploitation of disruptive technologies, in new media and entertainment, that elevate the way consumers interact with content. Recall's principal strategy is focused on the explosive market of Mixed Reality (both augmented and virtual), with a portfolio of proprietary technology (and patents pending) that is market-ready and slated for commercial introduction in 2018. In addition to Recall Studios' in-house development initiatives, the company believes strongly in the use of its public currency, supported by the experience of the leadership team, for the acquisition of best-of-breed technologies, applications and companies that further establish the company as an industry pioneer, with global visibility and scalable distribution for our applications.

Through the acquisition of Evolution AI Corporation, Recall Studios will secure participation in the exciting opportunities of artificial intelligence, and will also acquire control of Pulse Evolution Corporation, an entertainment technology company with an impressive global reputation. Pulse Evolution and its principals are most popularly known for producing some of the most visually stunning digital humans in the history of entertainment, including the Academy Award lead character in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), the digital alter-ego of Jeff Bridges in Tron: Legacy (2010), the holographic performance of Virtual Tupac Shakur at the Coachella Valley Music Festival (2012), and Virtual Michael Jackson at the Billboard Music Awards (2014).

Founded by new media pioneer John Textor, described recently by Forbes magazine as “Hollywood’s Virtual Reality Guru”, Evolution AI is committed to applications of Mixed Reality (VR and AR) and the important role that digital humans and artificial intelligence will play in the world of immersive entertainment.  We believe that the impressive digital humans and consolidated entertainment properties of Evolution AI will achieve even greater market potential through the AR and VR technology of Recall Studios.  For our shareholders, the purchase of Evolution AI Corporation will provide Recall Studios with global market visibility and product distribution opportunities that would otherwise take years to establish.

Also significant is that the board of Pulse Evolution recently announced its support for Recall's publicized tender offer for all available shares of PLFX stock trading in the public float. Recall has offered $1.38 per share of value, in the form of Recall Studios shares, for each share of Pulse Evolution so exchanged.  Recall believes this to represent fair and compelling consideration for the interest of Pulse shareholders.  Having closed on this acquisition of 150 million shares of Pulse this week, Recall is resoundingly committed to complete the public tender acquisition for the small percentage of Pulse that trades in the public float.  The focus is building shareholder value for Recall shareholders, as well as those Pulse shareholders who choose to become Recall shareholders, so it is the company's intent to acquire all remaining Pulse shares in the public float, terminate the PLFX ticker symbol, and take full responsibility for building the value of Pulse as a Recall Studios subsidiary.

Recall's purchase of Evolution AI Corporation and the planned tender offer to the shareholders of Pulse Evolution represent the first steps toward an exciting combination of Recall Studios’ impressive mixed reality technologies with established global players who are well known for their production of visually stunning computer-generated imagery and their innovative use of alternative display technologies in the development of new forms of entertainment.

aurochfam;1533995382;96goac;;6;;21;"$RKDA is a plant breeding company. It is nearing 10 years of product development, this is how long it takes to release new wheat varieties onto the commerical market. Therefore, they are currently at the position of product commercialization for their main product goodwheat. As we speak wheat millers are processing their first batch of wheat which they will provide to product makers like specialty baking companies. Their shtick is niche consumer -traits like low-gluten and better wheat composition for digestion. The miller testing their product is the largest in the USA who, if they find value in their product will create a major partnership with their company. Two other sources of major PR will be access to Chinese markets and FDA approval of their health claims. Additionally, they own IP on drought resistant soybean and long-last tomatoes which I suspect they may leverage as licensing or sell outright to bigger boys in the plant biotech industry to focus on the wheat industry.

They have fast access to the US farmers market through their Farmers Business Network partnership which is a silicon valley company which provides price matched resources (seed, pesticides, etc... ) as well as suggestions for which seed to plant based on neighbors yields/profits. Once goodwheat lines take hold they will be a premium commodity get promotion through the FBN.

Current price action is near an all time low after multiple positive PR's and a positive ER (transitioning from accepting research grants to focusing on mobilization of their miller partnerships. It has been daytraded to hell since a r/s in the past year where the price spiked to 60 dollars and has been bled out and diluted to \~5-6 dollars where it is currently. Their recent dilution have accumulated approximately 20 million dollarrs which they will use to fund the mobilization. They have at most 1 more dilution left in them before they start turning major products after miller-product testing this season. If they do dilute again I will pull money to invest in it for the medium-long term.

Wheat is especpially an interesting product because Wheat is one of the least innovated crops due to breeding difficulties, so a new product like goodwheat has the potential to shift a large portion of the market.

This stock burned a lot of people over the last few years. Why do I think this stock is interesting now?

**Positives**

* The Dow Solar shingle that they have licensed is now industry leading and has one of the best cost to energy generation [https://www.roofingcalc.com/bipv-solar-shingles-cost/](https://www.roofingcalc.com/bipv-solar-shingles-cost/)
* The reason their share price fell drastically is that they had to dilute for in arrears &amp; operational funding at the same time. The big Series A convertible note has either just been paid off in full, or will be in the next few days ($10.75M total). This may be a press release or part of earnings. This will significantly reduce dilution rate because all in arrears notes are paid off.
* Revenue is catching up to operational costs – they already released their preliminary quarterly results. 33% Q2/Q1 increase in sales. 60%+ decrease in operation loss (down to roughly $1M. (source [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rgs-energy-receives-9-8-123100964.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rgs-energy-receives-9-8-123100964.html))
* Volume is healthy. There will be inertia at small gains but should be no resistances.
* Their main product should receive UL Certification in the next few weeks which allows them to install their projects on the wait list.
* They are about to hit $100M in reservations for sales and just increased their capacity with a logistics firm partnership. $100M in reservations for a company which currently has a $15M market cap is pretty attractive. I would not be surprised if another company acquired them.
* Regulatory environment and cost vs ROI are finally in solar's favor

**Negatives**

* Management seems decent, not great. Older PRs were out-of-market and frankly stupid/misleading.
* There will be a conversion rate associated with the project reservations. Not all projects will be converted into revenue. Solar projects are getting better but financing can still be an issue.
* Dilution will continue for operations in the near term. Rate may change significantly if the company does not hit milestones. However, near term rate should be low based off of the small and decreasing operational losses.
* Delisting Notice (though this doesn’t effect my near term play)
* Never know what will happen day-to-day with environmental policies or tariffs

Please Note – use 45M shares outstanding for any of your short term diligence or technical planning

My play – I hope to purchase shares in the low to mid 0.30s SP. 50,000 to 100,000 shares. (I already have quite a few from Friday). I intend to swing trade through the positive catalysts listed above. My exit point will be based on momentum, perceived dilution, and PR strength. If UL hits &amp; Sales Reservations are above $100M is announced I will probably leave around half of my basis long term for long term growth or possible acquisition.

The company will use its EnergyVIEW solution in wastewater treatment facilities to save on the energy consumption in data centers used to mine Bitcoin. EnergyVIEW is an important automation component of integrated plant management and control systems. 

EnergyVIEW provides real-time energy consumption data for plant managers. This same technology can be used for data centers that mine Bitcoin and other complex computing activities, such as high frequency trading. Data centers demand an increasing use of energy, similar to water and wastewater facilities. EnergyVIEW technology can provide a way to decrease the energy cost for data centers. 

According to [Forbes](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3KJcqnlaZ9cvqKnn9OrGIwaDd21qWxb2uDimBrcLt6811c0AwM227y9Qx-bfRKTSkjXOnPKR3ZWPJrb_weVnIWuTQvL_vqHTsJ0Ckhmc4X7l9YWU5hSSzQrRfXPLh4PHEB-J4rhIksr0XMG-EQMyvAwnk97dqUKV_pqUmguRKuBCLXs-WvHhK7n0omJ7rWBvzJMLJrGZe64Pq2jyFLHgtWYwKmYDGIgkgZtUEKyKXy6puG86MMIZ49XOQkXJjjhr), “Bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption is 61.4 TWh, which is also equivalent to 1.5% of the electricity consumed in the United States.” Additionally, [Joule’s new study](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=gkf_9gC_7xWcP3zHy0mZ4Jjd-mPwRTSu42_bpRKGxlb9kfi7RHVciEoiZgM7aQcuPhiLC7aCSsGisNTEjjEXwwRZVfdV4eEV1bWTtspUrC62aME0_jzovJjzZvF9kx-nX6tHAixrC885x1YwEOdl-A==) estimates that mining for Bitcoin consumes at least 2.6 GW of power, equivalent to what Ireland consumes in electricity yearly. This figure could rise to 7.7 GW in early 2019, which would account for close to half a percent of the world’s electricity consumption. According to the Crescent Electric Supply Company, the estimated electricity can “cost between $3,224 to $9,000 to mine a single Bitcoin.”

The company is taking the technology from EnergyVIEW and adopting it and enhancing it for special use in Bitcoin mining to reduce the cost of energy consumption. From the filed patent, the blockchain energy consumption management technology will monitor the energy used in the data center and provide users with information they need to analyze the energy usage. Then, the data center can take steps toward better energy usage to increase efficiency and reduce energy costs. Once the technology is converted for this growing multibillion-dollar market, the company will begin to market the solution for an annual license fee. 

Some of the features in development for the Bitcoin data center include tracking historical data. The current usage is helpful, but historical data can give you a larger picture of your energy use. The data center usually has peak demand times and tracking these times provides an opportunity to reduce energy costs. Energy theft is a serious problem for many shared data centers. The power meter monitors energy use patterns and changes in the patterns. The patent covers ways to detect theft and short-circuit it.

“There are many vertical markets that can use our EnergyVIEW solution to reduce energy costs. We believe that Bitcoin data centers are a major opportunity to apply our technology,” said Shaun Passley, Ph.D., CEO of Epazz, Inc.

Even if you don't play chess, you can still appreciate the significance of this chess game between Googles new machine learning AI program, known as ""AlphaZero"", and Stockfish, which up until this point, was the strongest chess computer in the world. Stockfish is a classical computer, where millions of games are programmed into the software. It weights certain positions by a point system, and calculates via a brute force method, going through 100's of millions of positions, then picking the right one. As a chess player myself, playing Stockfish is futile, as even the most minute positional mistake will lead to an outright frontal assault on your king, or a loss of a piece 10 moves later. You'd think Stockfish would at least put up a fight, but what resulted shocked the chess and computer world. Not only did AlphaZero win decisively, but out of 100 games, Stockfish couldn't even win once. It was like watching a novice chess player playing a grandmaster, with AlphaZero making ridiculous sacrifices for seemingly dubious positional advantages, where 20 moves down the road, AlphaZero would end up with the better position. It was like Skynet on a chessboard. To make a sacrifice against a chess computer, even one, is a feat in it's own right, but it seemed like every other move was a ridiculously long line of 100's of different lines branching into 100's more. Almost every move included some kind of sacrifice.

You can almost feel like there is a human like intuitive discernment happening, like there is a person, and not just some robot, moving the pieces. It doesn't need to calculate as many positions like Stockfish because it sees a bigger picture that Stockfish is incapable of understanding. AlphaZero has a cohesion of thought that results in original insight, which you see in this game. It's like AlphaZero has a spacial understanding of the game that seems almost human. At times, it even seemed like AlphaZero was toying with Stockfish.

I believe this spacial understanding, and intuitive calculation, rather than brute force tallying, is the future of stock algorithms. Before these games, Google's AlphaGo beat the strongest Go player in the world, shocking the Go community. At the time, many professional Go players thought it was impossible to create a program that could beat a human due to Go's intuitive requirements, something up until then at least, was believed to be unique to humans. A few years ago, facebook had to shutdown it's AI algo because it created it's own language and was communicating with itself. Machine learning is already inventing new ways of doing things, without needing any human guidance. Is this really surprising though? Remember the movie Demolition Man with Wesley Snipes and Sylvester Stallone. The story was set in 2032, which back then was 40 years in the future, where people had flying cars and used seashell to wipe their ass. Well, it's 2018 now, almost 2019. Will this technology make the retail trader obsolete? Hopefully not, but as a long time chess player, who has watched hundreds of engines play, something inside me fears this may be the case";63377;Machine Learning, AI Chess Supercomputers, and The Future of The Retail Investor;
