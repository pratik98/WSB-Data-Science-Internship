tonmey;1514787209;7ndoo7;;13;;11;"From what I read on the internet, if a stock price is $100, after the split, the price should change (to $50 for 2/1 split ratio) to maintain its market capitalization. But this is largely untrue in the real world, the price doesn't change nearly enough to represent the math here. 
For example, CKH had a split of 3/2, on 2000/06/16, the closing price was $17.69, and the open price next day was $17.59. 
Another example, CL had a split of 2/1, the close and the open price next day were $24.34 and $24.25.

blackdragon1299;1514843747;7nhx7h;Ticker Discussion;5;;22;"This is a weekly series I like to do, go stir up some discussion for potential plays for the upcoming trading week. If you don't want to read this wall of text, check out the video: https://youtu.be/4habZ6Comg0


The 5 stocks this week that I'm watching are Alphabet (GOOGL), Alibaba (BABA), Visa (V), Paypal (PYPL) and the 5th is actually an index fund this week - the QQQ (Nasdaq ETF). 


* Google, or Alphabet, has had a big selloff the last 2 weeks going into the end of 2017 and into 2018. I believe that this will reverse in the upcoming week as buyers come back in and volume picks up. It may dip slightly below to the uptrend support that I outlined, which is in line with its 50 day MA, so that is another key level to watch.


* Next we have Alibaba, which is a stock I am extremely bullish on and hold in my long term portfolio as well. Alibaba has been consolidating for the last few weeks after a big selloff, but I believe the bulk of the damage is behind us. If we see volume come in this week, we will bounce off the uptrend support, break through the MA, and start a recovery before we hit $200 in a few months.


* Third we have Visa. This stock held up well even though the markets sold off, and we closed off friday about $0.90 off the ATH (all time high). We are still above the uptrend support, and I believe the holiday shopping season will push Visa to new ATH soon.


* Fourth is PayPal. Another company that will benefit from the holiday season and I think will make a recovery after it's recent sell off the last month or so. PayPal is holding it's technicals very well, and is holding the uptrend support as well. Again, if we see volume come back into the market, especially in tech, we will see PayPal make a run for ATH.


* Finally we have the Nasdaq ETF - QQQ - which follows mostly tech stocks. This is a good indicator as to how the market is doing, and the QQQ's are currently at a level that is slightly above some uptrend support. This is a key level to watch this week - if we bounce off this, we will see all of tech start a recovery, if we break through this support, we will start making lower prices on most of tech stocks.


What trades are you watching this week, and what will be your first purchase of 2018? Let's discuss! Happy investing :)";;5 Stocks I'm Watching this week [Jan 2-5, 2018];
WhenTimeFalls;1514845268;7ni2nx;;13;;0;"Today is 1-1-2018.

These are my calls for 1-1-2020. Many of these stocks, whether I predict them to be huge gainers or huge losers, have my attention for these two years.

This is my unprofessional, dumb, beginner attempt to guess what the stock market will be in 2 years if we have a bear market between now and then and if we have a bull market between now and then.

I am not at all predicting this to be accurate. I'm writing this down as a means of reference to see how close or far I was when 1-1-2020 comes.

Morsyn;1514859090;7njegi;Advice Request;9;;35;"Hello, I was hoping someone could answer a couple quick questions: 

I use Merrill Edge as a broker and always have, since it is very convenient to use through BoA and I don't seem to pay any fees for buying stocks. Why is ME never mentioned as a broker/why don't people like it? I see people saying they have to pay fees (albeit very low) for stocks through other brokers, so isn't that a huge perk from ME? I'm very open to switching over to RH or something if it's substantially better.

Secondly, this may a flaw only with ME, but do you HAVE to only use a limit order to buy low-security (i.e. penny) stocks? This is annoying because I'm trying to purchase TRTC before the market opens, but I can't buy at the market value, as I am assuming this stock is going to shoot up. Is there a way to snag it now, if I put in a limit above it would likely just shoot up past it like it has for me in the past.

hunterhast95;1514871055;7nkfvg;;11;;4;About 5% of my stock market investments are in one particular energy stock, a Permian-based oil and gas exploration and production company focusing on oil. In 2013 they had a stock price of ~$40. Once oil fell, they dropped to $0.58. They have slowly come back to $3 and during December a Forbes 400 member came in and purchased 47% of the outstanding stock for this company. It would appear that they are attempting to slowly take over the majority without greatly affecting market price because they are buying it in rather small chunks, with a total of around 48 Million shares to date. I believe if they do take it over the business will flourish, as they have made billions in this industry and the company has been lacking in leadership. This seems bullish to me and I am tempted to double or even triple down but I also fear that I am reading too much into it because this is the first time I will have ever been in a stock that was taken over by a new majority shareholder. What's everybody's opinion?;;Thoughts on a large stock purchase of stock(47%).;

Low interest rates and quantitative easing (QE) in the EU combined with improving private consumption is likely to help support the economy through the end of the decade.

As a whole, most developed economies are working around their expected capacities, recession risks are low, and central banks are either in full ZIRP/QE mode (ECB, BOJ) or just removing liquidity from the system and raising short-term borrowing rates (Fed).

The Phillips curve relationship that dictated past economic cycles has weakened as technology and globalization impact labor markets. Typically, as labor scarcity increases, workers can bargain for higher wages, with the extra wage costs passed off by corporations as higher prices, inducing inflation (i.e., monetary demand in excess of product and service output).

JoeClave;1515032163;7nzruc;;0;;1;"Some upfront info about me. I recently invested ~$50k in a Vanguard ETF (VTI) in order to get my money out of savings and into to something that will appreciate. I want to have a more targeted portfolio, specifically in technology (IT), manufacturing, mining, and maybe healthcare services. At this point I feel most comfortable sticking with ETFs, particularly ones with low management rates (which is why I picked VTI, and it is supposed to stick near to .INX). I plan to leave my money in until it looks like a better time to use it as a down payment. I am in the Seattle area, so I will either be forever priced out of the market while waiting for it to go down, or I will get in when prices become more reasonable. Hopefully that doesn't happen at the same time as a stock market downturn...

The reasons I have chosen these areas is because I read somewhere that they are where the Chinese govt has advised overseas investment. This last year (or 2?) has seen record amounts of Chinese investment in US (and elsewhere) real estate, but that tapered off after an advisory about it being more risky and new policies which requires Chinese investors to get govt approval for large overseas investment. My understanding is that they did this to slow currency flight. Maybe I am way off in terms of the Chinese effect, but I am assuming that investment moving from real estate to those sectors will have a big affect. I am also hoping that it deflates real estate markets :-/

Aside from that, it is my personal opinion that large companies are modernizing their IT systems and following the Amazonian data-driven business model, which I think will lead to an uptick in IT as well as profitability in the large cap market.

So, how does all this sound? What ETFs should I be looking at?

TheSirLeAwesome;1515034525;7o00h4;;8;;5;So I’ve done a bit of homework, looked through some stuff on here and watched a ton of tutorials and YouTube videos but I’m still a little confused about something: let’s say I buy 1 call contract for MSFT which expires on 19 January and the strike price is $86 while underlying stock is currently trading at $85.32. If I exercise my option I’m basically just buying 100 shares at the strike price. But what if I want to sell my contract before the expiration date because it’s now trading at $87 and that’s good enough for me? Am I literally just trading the option itself (in the same way if trade stock with setting my limit or a stop loss and so on)? And whose buying my contract? I assume that just because I sold doesn’t mean someone is buying? And if I do sell before the expiration date, then does that date become irrelevant to me? I get the basic mechanics of what an option is, I’m just not quite sure how selling them (versus exercising them) works. ;;Question about trading options;

Trivirus;1515041778;7o0orl;;67;;170;"Don't get upset if someone posts screenshots of how they gained 500%, 1000%, 8000%, or whatever in 1 year.

It is understandably frustrating when you're sitting on modest gains while know-nothings brag about how they turned a couple hundred into a couple thousand over a few months, but let me assure you: those cases are extraordinarily rare, and the other 95 out of 100 people will probably have lost money that way (30 will probably lose most of their initial capital).

Remember that as an investor, you have 2 goals: preservation of capital (money required to stay in ""the game""), and steady gains. 

This means that you are REQUIRED to diversify, and do your DD on whether the stock's growth prospects/fundamentals are sound.

Sure, you can throw a few bucks here and there into weed or meme stocks, but a lot of it simply boils down to sheer dumb luck.

Did anyone foresee Veritone, an extremely speculative ""AI"" stock, would shoot from $20 to almost $70?

Did anyone foresee garbage stocks like Twitter (loss-making) would gain 45% in 2017?

Did anyone foresee Canopy Growth would shoot from its properly valued $9 to almost $30?

No, almost nobody did. It was pure ""luck"" and FOMO.

Anyway, to avoid dealing with instances like these (esp. on the Internet where anyone can lie or even photoshop their portfolio's ""performance""), I simply do the following:

1) Ask what investing philosophy that person uses 

  
2) Prove that their previous calls/advice on what to buy have managed to beat the market in the past (a method called ""Backtesting"") 
  

If they cannot satisfy these 2 criteria, the person is probably lying/hoping to ""get lucky."" Don't bother with these people, you might as well consult an ouija board or throw darts at a financial newspaper.";;Friendly Reminder;

Here's the thing. I've been reading about S/L to minimise losses which some talked about roughly 5-9%, and taking profit at 20-25%. 

Thus, I opened a few trade to spread my portfolio and set the S/L accordingly. I actually had 2 buys hitting S/L in less than a week which I chucked it off as a good sign that I prevented further losses ($AXP, $SQ), only to find today, more than a week later it bounced back and doing better, or going to. But at least others are picking up well so it wasn't negative profit/loss.

Doing a bit more reading, seems like there's two sides to this sub. 

No S/L -VS- Yes S/L

I'm going for long term buys listed below so I'm thinking whether I should actually remove the S/L since flash crash could occur? No notification since market runs while I sleep, I could just have a look in the morning and decide. But since I'm betting on them long term, should I take profit at 25%? Which feels like it doesn't make sense when going long term.

Google isn't helping me enough so I'm looking for experienced help before I go to a brokerage so I can have a better understanding myself.

April 3 year 2000 my grandpa was givin a certificate that states ""fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of $.001 par value each of"" and this consists of 197 shares.
 The stock is called ""Global Sources Limited"". To my understanding they have split numerous times and another company bought them within these 17 years.

On this certificate it also states ""This certificate and the shares represented hereby are subject to the laws of the state of delaware and to the certificate of incroporation and Bylaws of the corporation, as of now or hereafter amended.This certificate is not valid until countersigned by the transfer agent.""
All that seems like regular legal things they have to say, so I guess all that is normal? 

I also live in NYC and it does say somewhere on the certifcate ""countersigned and registered: american stock transfer &amp; trust company, New york"" So this looks like a good sign as well.


My grandpa doesn't know any english really and simply has no knowledge about any of this kind of stuff. I would most likely be selling it for him and this would be a gift for me to use into investments. 

I have no idea how to find out exactly how much those 197 shares are worth now considering all the things this company went through the last 17 years this is why im hoping someone experienced can offer some real insight. If you guys think finding any real info here isn't going to work I guess giving me really good references to finding everything I need to know will help. 



I know i can simply just go to a brokerage but I rather gain as much knowledge as I can first so I'm more equipped in case they miss something or whatever.

OpenTilMidnight;1515204330;7og9mu;;7;;10;"An example will help illustrate my confusion:
Company A is trading on the stock exchange for $1.00. They've put out a notice that they've issued ""1,000,000 unlisted options (with an exercise price of $0.40 and expiry date of &lt;date&gt;) for $400,000""

I am assuming that the company has done this to raise capital (the $400k)?

I'm struggling to understand the 'fairness' of this transaction. The new investor is getting a significant discount on the price they pay per stock compared to everyone else using the stock exchange. Then, when the expiry date comes around, any outcome (apart from a 60% catastrophic crash) will mean they make money, at the expense of all the other shareholders. 

To me, it just seems a bit shady. Like, the people running the company have allocated a portion of the company for much less than it is worth (at today's price), and, in a way that most people can't do, too.

My question is why not invest in stocks that you believe are on an upward trend long term and will only continue to rise? If that stock doesn't return a profit intraday or over a few days, why not keep the stock for weeks or months until it does return profit? I understand there's no guarantee that a stock will continue to rise long term but many stocks such as Apple and Google have continued to rise for several years. 

Why not just day trade or swing trade stocks that you know will at least rise over time? If you're unable to return a profit short term, keep that stock until you can. Any negatives to this strategy other than the risk that the stock may never recover? ";;New to Day Trading. Would Like Feedback on Stategy.;

These are NOT penny stocks whose entire company is based on blockchain. If you are a visual learner, you can watch the video [here](https://youtu.be/jOBKNzp9i_k)


1. Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR)
- 
- Broadridge provides investor communications and other solutions to the financial sector. They are one of the pioneers in this industry.
* Broadridge is a standing out in the blockchain trend bc they’ve already completing a successful pilot test of a blockchain-based technology in collaboration with two large European banks in October.
* The company partnered with JPMorgan in 2016 to successfully test its technology with shareholder proxy voting to make it easier and more transparent. Considering BR was already the largest U.S. provider of proxy voting services, it made sense for it to step in here.
2. MasterCard (MA)
- 
* Mastercard announced that it is now opening up its blockchain to certain banks and merchants as an alternative and potentially more efficient method of paying for goods and services.
* They are targeting cross-border payments between businesses as the primary purpose for its blockchain, which can only be used by invitation.
* Mastercard’s blockchain operates independently and instead accepts payments in traditional local money which is seen by some as a positive. 
3. Microsoft (MSFT)
- 
* Microsoft is committed to bringing blockchain to the enterprise and they are working with customers, partners, and the blockchain community to continue advancing its enterprise readiness through it’s COCO Framework
* Coco will be compatible, by design, with any ledger protocol and can operate in the cloud and on premises
* By design, Coco is open and compatible with any blockchain protocol. Microsoft has already begun integrating E
* Microsoft’s intent is to contribute the source code to the dev community in early 2018
4. Visa (V)
- 
* Visa has rolled out the first, pilot phase of its blockchain-based business-to-business payments service, B2B Connect.
* Similar to MasterCard, Visa plans to use the platform to ease cross-border payments by facilitating direct payments between institutions, cutting out the middleman the industry currently relies on.
* Visa's global head of solutions, Kevin Phalen, said that the banks are trialing live bank-to-bank transactions over the platform. Following this first phase of the project, phase two will see the project move to a commercial launch, slated to occur in the middle of 2018
5. Cisco Systems (CSCO)
- 
* Cisco is one of the 200 organizations that are a part of the Enterprise E Alliance. These are governments and companies from all over the world, and multiple industries, testing out a version of E's blockchain
* Cisco is also working to craft its own blockchain systems. In October, the company filed for the trademark of a blockchain platform that can identify different connected devices, monitor the activity of those devices, and evaluate how trustworthy those devices are when connected to a network. 
* It would also continually and automatically assess new devices when added to the network. In other words, Cisco believes it has a game-changing blockchain to track the Internet of Things.";;Big Companies Using Blockchain in 2018;

* BABA - 10.6%

* V - 4.24%

* PYPL - 6.9%

* QQQ - 3.95%


Looking into this week, we are due for some consolidation or pullback, but there are a still plays that could work out this week. As always, I have this in video format [which you can watch here](https://youtu.be/PoibBodbkLU) if you don't want to read this block of text.

1. Apple (AAPL) - So although tech had a big week, Apple kind of lagged behind. It's a slow mover, BUT, once it gets moving, it makes big moves. The technicals show it's at a critical point for a breakout, so keep a close eye on this. If we see any news leak about positive iPhone 10 sales over the holiday season, expect this to go to ATH. Also ER is scheduled for Feb 1, so we will most likely see a run up soon enough.


2. Nvidia (NVDA) - Solid company, and it had a rough couple of months after breaking the $200 level. Now we're back, and with CES around the corner, I suspect this will have a good move as well. Earnings again I believe is in Feb. If you look @ the technicals, you can see that it broke a key uptrend resistance level on STRONG volume - this is a very good sign for the stock as buyers have come back in and believe it should move higher. When Nvidia gets moving, we see it move A LOT, so this is a good one to watch this week.


3. Square (SQ) - Recovering from ATH of $50 from couple months ago, Square is starting to make a comeback. We saw it bottom out around $34 or so (I personally wanted it to $30, but that's fine...) and now we see some movement upwards. Once again, we broke resistance on good volume, and now we bounced off support (and the 50 day) with STRONG volume. This is good confirmation that we are ready to start heading back to the ATH of $50 in this stock, but it may take a few weeks to get there. Friday had amazing movement, and overall I think we have a lot more room to move here. I personally picked up some LEAPs (Jan 2019 expiry, 50C) and they were fairly cheap. I don't think we'll have any problems seeing Square back at $50 before Jan 2019...


4. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) - They got a nice rally thanks to the news that came out from EA last week. Typically gaming stocks like to follow each others movement (EA, ATVI, TTWO), but I think technically, TTWO has the best charts and the best potential for a swing trade. If you look @ the charts, you can see that it broke through a key resistance level, on good volume, so we should be watching it closely next week to see if volume continues on with this. The stock has been beaten down since making new ATH a few months ago, although nothing fundamentally changed, so I think we'll see a good move up in the upcoming weeks as long as the market keeps moving up.


5. Walmart (WMT) - This is a new stock I've never covered on my 5 stocks weekly videos, but the consolidation on this caught my attention. I have a position in them, longer dated calls, because I do believe we are just waiting for a Catalyst to gap up and move higher. This is the first time the stock closed above $100, which is typically a big resistance point for a stock to get past. It has consolidated around here since its last ER, and this move up was expected. Now as long as volume comes in, we could see this at $105-$110 before the next ER. If we see news come out that they had a record holiday season or something like this, I expect it to gap up and start a good rally. Walmart is a slow mover though, so it may take a few weeks to see movement here, but keep an eye on it!

anshulmewade;1515381763;7ovphh;;0;;0;"In stock market trading, volume-based indicators are extremely useful. Volume is a not an exact opening and exit instrument. Though, with the aid of certain technical indicators. Opening and getting out signals are produced. By staring at price action and size based indicator. Technically, if we define volume then it means the total number of shares bought. And sold each day in any given financial instrument. This is one of the most accurate ways of gauging money flow. Traders make use of Money flow to determine the overall supply and demand characteristics. The size is a very powerful tool. But many traders and technical analysts do not use it, as this is a simple indicator. Still, many traders believe the strength of using the size indicator and use it to get maximum profit.
On Balance, Volume is the simple form of indicator but is an effective one. Beginning from the arbitrary number. If the market ends up higher. Then the size is added and if the market ends up at low then the volume is subtracted. In this method, one will predict that stocks square measure being engineered up. And informs about the running total of the stocks. It also indicates the divergence. When the price of the stocks rises. And the volume is increasing at slower rate or volume might have started falling.

Madman7817;1515532507;7pabjv;Discussion;2;;6;"This is a DISCUSSION! Please know moreover, that this isn't a conspiracy theory. It's information available readily online, that Central Bank balance sheets have increased substantially in the last 10 years (ECB, Japanese CB, SNB, and Fed), and that interest rates are super low (common knowledge), and that SOME (not all) central banks are buying equities. Off the top of my head, ECB, Japan, and SNB buy equities. 

The reason for this is supposedly to act as a diversification tool for central banks who are overexposed to government debt, but lets not get into politics or speculation. 

What I want to discuss is whether the stock market rise can be attributed to these central bank factors as much as (if not more than) the growth of global economies. Moreover, how long do you think this behavior will continue? Technically indefinitely as central banks can ""print"" money, but can they really keep doing this in a practical manner?

Please add any companies you are watching to go public in 2018 in the comments so we can look into them as well. If you want to watch the video where I go more in depth on each pick, here it is: https://youtu.be/zJQagRBjDCk


* 1: Spotify - Spotify is a company that has a dominance in the music streaming space, and competes with companies like Pandora, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Google Music, but has still managed to be the #1 choice for consumers. in 2018, we will most likely see this company go public. I can see them being the Netflix of music - and eventually become their own label (like original content)


* 2: Uber - Popular ride sharing app that is used around the world and most people know about the company and use it regularly as well. Strong rumours that this will indeed go public in 2018, but this was also rumoured in 2017. They are valued at somewhere between 60-70B.


* 3: Lyft - Competitor to Uber and also a ridesharing app. Not as big as uber around the world however the most enticing part of this company is that they have Alphabet is an investor (I believe a 1B investment from Alphabet). They are valued at somewhere between 10-15B.


* 4: Avaya - Hardware company, transforming to a software and services company. They are big in the UC space, and Contact Center space as well. Main competitors are Cisco and Mitel in the same space. Recently came out of Chapter 11, and not quite sure on their valuation when they will go public.


* 5: Xiaomi - This is a chinese company who primarily makes smartphones and related electronics (power banks, accessories, etc.). They are making waves in China and is a good competitor to Huawei in China. If they go public in 2018, they will come in at around a 50B valuation.


* 6: Airbnb - This is a popular app for travelers. It allows you to rent out your house or room to earn a bit more income whenever you are on vacation, or if you have extra space in your house being unused. The prices are typically cheaper than hotels and I personally used it, for example for cottage rentals with friends, or when we traveled to Japan. Airbnb is great when you can't find a Hotel in a rural area, or if you want to stay in the heart of the city for cheaper than a hotel (typically). They are currently valued at 30-40B.


* 7: Dropbox - They allow you to upload and share files with others online. They are essentially cloud storage, and was one of the first ones to do this before others got in the game (Apple, Google, etc.). Think of it as a hard drive that is hosted by Dropbox, and you can upload and download files from there at any time, share the files with friends, etc. Dropbox is currently valued at 10B in 2014, not sure where it's at now, but if I had to guess, I'd say 15-20B.


* 8: Ancestry.com - Allows you to see your family tree. I've never used it personally, but they claim to have over 7B records from US, Canada, Europe. They offer a free trial if you're curious about family roots, so could check it out and see if you want to subscribe to their service (I personally would never...). Currently valued at around 3B.


* 9: Zscaler - Cloud and security company that provides firewalls, antivirus, SSL, and anything required in keeping a secure connection. They are big in the enterprise space and have a good presence in the industry for security. Currently only valued at 1B which may be a pretty good deal for a company that provides good value.


* 10: Pinterest - They are essentially a Social network. It's idea is for images and to save images to view later. For example, my wife used it before the wedding and would add different hairstyle ideas in there. She could go on google images and when she sees one she likes, there's a button to add to Pinterest. Then you have all of these pictures in 1 spot later to compare and view. The company is currently valued at around 12-13B.

WhoTradesGlobal;1515596811;7pg4v7;;0;;1;"Having portfolio balance allows one to better smooth returns over time by reducing the correlation between assets. It helps to limit drawdowns and make the painful periods more tolerable that are generally experienced every 5-10 years.  

Portfolio balance simply means not putting too much of your allocation into any given asset class. If you own a bunch of stocks, it might seem like diversification because the portfolio contains many securities. But the correlation between assets is high such that the portfolio will do well when the economy is growing and do poorly when the economy is declining.  

If an equities portfolio is diversified with bonds of various qualities and durations and some small amount of real assets, then when the economy is doing poorly, instead of the entire portfolio being dragged down with it, part of the non-equities portion (most reliably safe bonds) will kick in and limit the damage. It can even potentially boost it higher, depending on the allocation. The main exception to this is during financial depressions where cash outperforms virtually all financial assets.  

Pension funds, for example, will tend to employ strategies that diversify to an extent. A typical portfolio construction will be something along the lines of 50% stocks, 25% bonds, and 25% real estate and other alternative investment vehicles such as hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital.

Sure the company still hasn't quite figured it out yet in terms of making this a profitable and successful company, but with the huge brand awareness of Twitter and 300 million plus users, isn't it only a matter of time until they do?

-walkingonair-;1515631850;7pkb5d;;14;;4;"I was doing some dd today and came across a company called Novavax. I realize it is pretty hype in the news currently but that is none of my concern. My motive behind this post is how to avoid the MASSIVE SELLOFF Novavax endured September 6, 2016. Overall -700% in 6 days! The news that I find posted that caused this crash was as follows:
 ""Novavax down 84% after disappointing vaccine trial 
5:26 PM ET Thu, 15 Sept 2016 | 03:24 
https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/15/novavax-shares-plummet-82-after-trial-does-not-meet-objectives.html

Novavax shares plummeted more than 84 percent in extended trading on heavy volume after the company released disappointing trial data on Thursday.

The company said that its phase 3 Resolve trial ""did not demonstrate vaccine efficacy"" in the prevention of a lower respiratory tract disease.
Novavax was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the results, said Gregory Glenn, president of research and development. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now my question to fellow stock traders is how would I, as a share holder, be able to foresee such a selloff like this when there are no articles nor news posted anywhere making the public aware of Novavax's failed trial until 9 days after the sell off (this being too late of notice as it already fell from $8 to $1.20 and now is worth nothing for next year until recent news). I found this article posted on September 7, 2016 (one day after sell off began)
https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/09/07/870279/0/en/Novavax-to-Host-4th-Annual-Investor-and-Analyst-Meeting.html

In this article it is mentioned: ""Novavax expects to announce data from its pivotal Phase 3 trial of the RSV F Vaccine in older adults in the third quarter of 2016.""
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now how can a stock begin crashing September 6th due to bad news of failed trial but on September 7th the company releases news that it has yet to have results from said trial?

Any help clearing this up would be greatly appreciated! I am still new to trading stocks and am trying to make a sense of how to predict a stock's movement based on news but it seems like in many cases the stock falls and then the bad news is released...am I missing something??

FOREXAaron;1515632168;7pkcc9;;5;;10;"I'm getting more into equities, after trading a macro based style for the last few years. I'd like to add long/short equities aspect to my portfolio, and I'd like to be a generalist (cover all sectors of the entire market if possible) but I'm unsure if I'd be better off specializing. If being a generalist can work do you guys think there's any tips or guidelines I should follow? The advantage would be a wider range of opportunities, while specializing would allow me to have more in-depth information about one sector. I should still be able to make macro plays in baskets of stocks, even if I specialize in one sector, so that takes some of the edge off, though I'd like to be able to cover the entire market with a good way of filtering opportunities.

ETA: The downside of being a generalist would be that it'd be time-consuming to do DCF's and properly research every company in every sector while keeping up with relevant news for each company. I'd wager it'd be impossible for one person to do it properly, so depth of knowledge would suffer covering all sectors.

I would love to know where you get your news from. I am a forex trader and I trade only during important news and when there is high momentum (they tend to be correlated). I use an economic calendar that organizes all news in order of how important they are for certain currency with time and date. Is there something similar for the stock market? If I want to follow certain tickers, is there a website telling me when the next announcements are?

Analysts forecast much smaller growth (I am well aware they are not always right). But i'm getting suspicious as the internet has a serious lack of information, articles, any buzz about the company.

Not promising 100% perfection nor am I saying that this should null and void any homework/research or any potential homework/research you should be doing before completing a new investment purchase**


In the wake of the Ulta annual report coming up relatively soon, I decided to take a look back on last years annual report to make an investing decision for the 2018-2019 investing season.  


**All numbers are in thousands**


**Income Statement**

Gross profit increased 1,384,333 to 1,747,229

Operating income increased 506,297 to 654,824 


*Review*

For the amount of gross profit increase the operating income increase is actually higher margins then the year before(37% up from 36.5%).

On average net income increase 70,000 per year.


**Balance sheet**

Total current assets = 1,536,237 with 385,000 equaling cash or cash equivalents(1/5th of all current assets).

Total liabilities = 1,001,660(accounts payable increased by 130,000)


*Review*

Don't look interested into divesting more assets to become a more cash ready business.

Year over year there is significant divesting from short term investments. 


**Chart**

-25% since June

-11% year to date


**Pros/Cons**

*Pros*

Good CEO

Cheaper place for cosmetics compared to some high end cosmetic independents

Makeup is still receiving huge business from retail and during a recession when the cosmetic marketing budgets are cut from influencer marketing there will be an even bigger drive for retail sales

Long term with a future in online sales increases I predict the stock hitting $300 while we see other independent cosmetics moving into retailers


*Cons*

They still are retail, I believe there is going to be a need for Ulta to increase online revenues for all the pros to be true. 


**Do I believe in the company:** I see both short term and long term success for the company. Personally I am not currently invested into ULTA at the time of this post and full disclosure I am trying to wait out another dip in price.


**This is my first review of a stock that I have posted on reddit, any tips to make this a more helpful piece for you specifically or everyone in general I would love to hear in the comments.

blackdragon1299;1515798323;7q0iyw;Ticker Discussion;5;;2;"Before I start, I would like to say that I am very bullish on Apple, and I hold both shares &amp; calls (shorter term and LEAPs). I believe they will have a great quarter with beats across the board. If you don't want to read this block of text and prefer watching in video format, that is available here: https://youtu.be/Kyh1H33NFJM

I'm expecting this year to be one of Apple's best years ever, especially since they just released the iPhone X, consumer spending was at an all time high, and because their services business is exploding.

What I did for some research was to go on Amazon.com Best Sellers list, and checked to see how Apple-related products did in the Cellphone &amp; Accessories department.

So looking at Top 20:

* -12/20 were products specifically for Apple - they claimed spots 2,3,5,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,17,18

* -Out of these 12 spots, 2 were iPhone X: #8 and #13


Looking at Top 50:

* -26/50 were specifically for Apple

* -rank 32 and 38 were again specifically for iPhone X

This gives us a good idea as to how we can expect iPhone sales to be, because if people are purchasing new accessories (especially ones specifically for iPhone X), that means they also purchased a new iPhone X, and/or someone they know purchased an iPhone X. Note Apple doesn't earn revenue from these accessories, but again, it's indicative of what phones consumers are purchasing. Google's Pixel 2 was released around the same time, but you don't see any accessories (like cases, screen protectors, etc.) for this phone in the top 20 (or 50?).

Next I look at other products by Apple or for Apple products at the best sellers in overall Electronics:

* -#46 spot is Apple 4K TV

* -#57,59,64,65,69,75 were also Apple or apple released

No doubt that Apple will beat numbers on their Apple 4K TV as sales have been strong here, and most were not expecting this.

Additionally, Apple sells iPads, Apple Music, Apple Watch, Macs desktops and Macbooks. Numbers from last quarter were outstanding across the board, and I don't think this quarter will be any different especially since this was a record year for the holiday season like I mentioned. 

I also want to address the App store. Revenue from App Purchases rose 35% in 2017 and Apple reportedly keeps 15% of this revenue. As a reference, from December 24 - December 31, 890M in app purchases were made, and on New Years Day alone (which won't be part of the upcoming earnings report), there was another 300M in sales. This shows that the Apple ecosystem is stronger than ever.

Finally, I want to address Apples Services business. Their revenue for last quarter was 8.5B vs 6.32B expected - which is a 34.5% beat. For a company of Apples size, to beat by this much is just mind blowing and its important to note that services is very profitable for Apple, so they are collecting a lot of the revenue from this which just adds to their 260B+ cash balance.

So to close off, this is what analysis expect for this quarter: EPS 3.75 vs EPS 3.36 from the same quarter last year. Apple themselves in the last earnings call has said that they expect 84-87B in revenue. 

So we'll find out in a few weeks if Apple can beat these numbers and send the stock in an upward momentum to $200/share and if they will become the worlds first 1 TRILLON dollar company.

To contextualize the QE tightening with the Fed funds rate, we look to the shadow Fed funds rate. The shadow rate will be slightly higher than the Fed funds rate in 2018. In 2019, the gap widens. This means the Fed’s monetary policy will be getting more hawkish than Yellen would like to admit. The Fed wants to get the balance sheet to between $2 trillion and $2.5 trillion, but if the Fed is nearly as hawkish as it usually gets at the end of contractionary cycles, this goal probably won’t be reached.

Mite-o-Dan;1516060931;7qo872;;4;;0;"I know it's common for penny stocks but there's still lots of stock over $10 a share where you can only purchase through limit orders. It's really annoying trying to guess the price you think it will open at and pray you catch it. You usually miss out because your order is too low or miss out on gains or even lose money because you guessed too high.

Edit- I know why limit orders exist and it's a good thing for highly volatile penny stocks, but why do so many cheap stocks ONLY have a limit option? I can't find the answer to this or my above question anywhere on the internet. A million different sites talk about limit orders and all the different ways to buy and sell, but for some reason never go over this aspect of why and how long it will last and when they can move up to normal market value trading. 

By ""limiting"" investors, you're hurting the investor, brokerage firm, and company because it's missing out on more investment money since lots of people put in limit orders that never hit.

kyra_gem;1516131485;7quvui;;10;;1;"So stocks are at an all time high valuation (See [Shiller's PE](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/)). I believe this overvaluation is largely due to a shift in passively managed exchanged traded funds. 

Because ETFs offer better tax benefits, lower fees and similar returns a lot of investors have moved their money from mutual funds into ETFs. Currently it is estimated that nearly 3 Trillion USD is invested in passive ETFs and nearly 30% of company stocks are held by an ETF. Many of these ETFs just follow an index like S&amp;P500. The problem with this shift to ETFs is that they just invest in all companies in that index regardless of whether that company does well. Because a rising tide lifts all boats and thus all stocks in some index like S&amp;P500 or other Russell 2000 have been doing well, which then attracts more money into these index tracking ETFs like a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Anyway nothing wrong with ETFs but just curious if the upcoming market correction happens whether ETFs will accelerate this further since it is quite new financial instrument that hasn't really been tested in a bear market. Unlike mutual funds ETFs can be sold any time during business hours and unlike stocks they don't have the same liquidity and could quickly be pushed to zero when everyone starts selling.

First, we need to set the base and time frame by which we compare. Let’s choose to buy on EOD price and Selling on EOD price, the time frame would not be set in order to get the best results on all time frames (I’ll explain later).

#The Process
The process is simple to understand but not as simple to execute as there are many pitfalls that may hinder our outcome. 
We now have our data and a basis to work with. There is a process we need to perform on each symbol we deem worthy (not all symbols are suitable for this as some lack the historical data or are simply not within the margin we select due to low volume or low price).
From now on I’ll address a single symbol, this operation will be executed on all symbols iteratively until we have a complete database of our processed data.
There are many types of cycles we can examine (Annually, Monthly, Weekly, Etc.), I’ll choose the yearly cycle for our example.  As we selected Daily we need the daily change for our symbol.
This is the fun part, we now take every date span permutation in a year and calculate the historical statistics for that span (the permutations amount is in the magnitude of tens of thousands).
After all of the symbols are iterated, our database is ready. I will not elaborate on the pruning process of eliminating unsuccessful spans as this is very personal and is determined by your risk appetite. I’ll just say that I would not keep opportunities that show less than desirable our come or ones that show little reward for substantial risk.  

#Validation
How do we assure we have a working seasonality model?  Like all trading strategies, that is not something we can be certain of but it’s a matter of odds. we can show a level of certainty by backtesting our results. We calculate our database based on data up to 2016 (all years not including 2016 and on) and compare the opportunities we gathered with real results in 2016. 
What we got was ~70% success rate for specific kind of opportunities, ones that showed previous positive results of 85% meaning that if the stock had a history of 20 years prior to 2016, at least 17 years had yielded a profit.  
we did the same for 2017 and had pretty much the same results. 

#Opportunity picking
Our database of opportunities is ready. All there is left to do is pick our “most likely to succeed” opportunities based on our validation process. 

#Further Filtration and Perfection
This post is about getting the idea on how to calculate seasonality, it only shows the basics. We do employ many more means to perfect our results, such as stop-loss and money management tactics.

Just looking at both overall markets won’t get you far because each one has different structural advantages and sector weightings. For example, US markets are liquid and the economy is politically stable. This is less true of some emerging markets. Therefore, America gets a higher multiple. The situation is further complicated by the fact that US companies have exposure abroad. If emerging markets and other developed markets have decent economic growth despite US weakness in 2-3 years, the American weakness for these multinational corporations will be mitigated by strength abroad. America might catch a cold, while some other countries do well. While strength abroad can mitigate earnings risk, high valuations still make the US a risky market to invest in long term.

My motivation – 
1. So I can give family, friends and myself a life without worry. So, we have more time to focus on building meaningful experiences and forming a strong relationship with each other.
2. If profitable enough, to donate to cancer research to hopefully one-day cure cancer, more specifically, malignant brain cancers.
3. To have financial freedom.
4. To build wealth for myself and future generations of my family, regardless if it is my own kin. 
5. To challenge myself.
How I am doing this?
Adopting a mix of education, research and simulated training I hope that by the end of CY18 I can have a small account funded 1500-3000 for trading while also focusing on paying down debt.

Education and Research:
Reading List
1.	Security Analysis – 
a.	To gain a fundamental basis to judge a stocks worth, it has great reviews and has been recommended on multiple different platforms as a must read, so I am must reading it
b.	This book will not relate to the trading strategy that will be adopted in the beginning to build greater wealth. However, I think this will become a staple of future trading strategies. This book is basically the polar opposite to speculative trading/investment which will comprise the trading the trading strategy used to develop the wealth needed to reach the 25k minimum needed to day trade. 
2.	Japanese candlestick charting techniques (JCCT)--
a.	This book is allegedly a great source on learning candlestick patterns and learning technical analysis. 
b.	The focus will be learning how to read charts quick and effectively, allowing me to draw reasonable and insightful conclusions on the potential movement on stock based on its price-action
3.	Will add more to the list after I finish these, but as of now I have determined learning a mix between fundamental &amp; technical analysis will keep me well rounded so I don’t tunnel vision one way of trading. The aim is to remain well rounded and not to rely on one skill too much. 

Online resources –
1.	Youtube
a.	Ricky Gutierrez – stocks
b.	Timothy Sykes – stocks
c.	The Duomo initiative – Forex 
d.	Numerous other youtube sources
2.	Babypips – Forex 
3.	Lehman Brothers “Foreign Exchange Training Manual” (Dekstop)
4.	Reddit? 
5.	Will add more as they come
Simulation—
1.	Tradingview.com
a.	Good charts, great indicators, free ‘real-time’ data and awesome charting features available as well as an easy to use papertrading, seems like a good resource for FOREX/STOCKS
b.	
2.	TD Ameritrades ThinkOrSwim (TOS)
a.	60 day Demo account that I called and got real-time data, the closest thing to a real deal trading platform I can get my hands. Will probably keep trying to learn this and use it as my basis for learning how to execute trades in the FOREX and Equity Markets. 
b.	When the demo account runs out, make a new one, call and get live data set to the account again
3.	The criteria used for the trading software
a.	Don’t make a lot of trades, I want to focus on only taking trades based on as much calculated risk as I can possibly calculate
b.	Trade around the pattern day trader rule, as when it’s time to go live I want to be used to it. What this means for me, is only take 1 or 2 trades a week, and making them meaningful.
c.	Try to learn something from every trade I make, failure or success I want to know if it’s pure luck or calculated risk. 
i.	IF it’s a failure, I want to analyze why it happened to the best of my ability. 
ii.	If it’s a success, I want to analyze how it happened and try to really solidify the knowledge.
d.	Try to imagine the money in the paper trading account is as real as the money in my pocket. 
e.	Don’t rush or force trades, wait for a good “set-up” or situation. Stick to my technical analysis tools/skills and adapt to changing situations based on news releases.


Training—
1.	Read at least 30 minutes each day of either Security Analysis or JCCT
2.	Use youtube, babypips, reddit or some other online resource to learn SOMETHING that day. I don’t care if I am rereading the Relative Strength Indicator equation, I will do some form of online research and make it meaningful or impactful in some way.
3.	Using a simulation platform, most likely TOS, develop a strategy for taking trades during the week. Live by the criteria I set for myself.
a.	Use each blown up paper account as lesson.
b.	Stay focused and don’t get emotional
c.	Rome wasn’t built in a day.
d.	Go live when I win more than I lose, and am green for 4 months.
4.	Don’t forget who I’m doing this for and why.
To-Do list – 
1.	Compile a list of terms, phrases, vocabulary and indicators to define/research and call it homework 
2.	Find or develop a good trading journal that is designed around a specific strategy, and before I enter into any trade I can fill it in this journal and if it meets criteria it’s time to buy.
3.	Make myself some form of “homework” at-least once a week and learn from it.
4.	If everything works out remain humble and try to help others succeed also. 
Summary –
The goal is through a mix of, foundational reading (Security Analysis, JCCT and others), online resources, and simulated trading I can go from someone with very low to almost no knowledge of financial markets to a profitable and successful trader in the next 6-24 months. Using realistic and measurable goals to gauge progress (how many books have I read since I set the curriculum? How am I doing papertrading? Am I staying focused? Am I too focused?) as well as always constantly reforming and changing the training plan to grow with me I think this is possible.

Would you guys have any ideas for me ? I want to do good with my money, or at least, not do bad ! (yes I know, I am naive :D )

VGN is a unique one. Its a resource company that receives royalties from legacy assets, along with some investments and the drones. The CEO is not shy to buy back shares. The biggest investment recently is a decent position in Cannabis investment bank Quinsam Capital (QCA). QCA has rewarded substantial returns and VGN has done essentially nothing. The stock is severely undervalued going into a fresh growing season with the rapidly growing Drone business. Roger Dent CEO of QCA is on the board of VGN. Along with VGN CEO Anthony Roodenburg is on QCA board. So I would imagine another investment in the Cannabis space wouldnt be out of the cards. (Drones are main focus).

Both are low growth high dividend stock that ive just kid of trusted, both are under-performing the market as such stocks often like to dom however with their amazing dividends it hasnt been so bad.

Which of these two companies would you rather have, and why? Both have similar P/e ratios, both give around 3% dividend(However im already heavy in low growth dividend stocks from other sectors than consumer staples.

This isnt an easy choice as they are both fantastic companies, but i cant keep both as I slowly move out of equities and into safer, more stable funds.

After reading [How Currency Fluctuations Impact Canadian Investors](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/currency-fluctuations-impact-canadian-investors/) I am left with questions.

The article describes investment of Canadian to US stock market. And that is pretty forward, you are exposed to stock price fluctuations and because you need to convert CAD-&gt;USD, you are exposed to currency fluctuations.

What if you invest in cross listed stock (ex. ABX.NYSE, ABX.TSE) are you exposed the same way? (here I mean long term, 5-10 years). I read somewhere that the exchange ratio is priced in and if I am reading price charts right that seems to be the case.

If company has headquarters in Canada is it best to invest on TSE or is there no difference (TSE, NYSE)? Are there any advantages/disadvantages?

And for investor from eurozone (€), is it best to invest into Canadian company on TSE or NYSE?
How are the dividends effected?

logicalandwitty;1516387800;7rkjbo;;4;;0;"So in late December (approx 22 days ago) I made a post detailing what I have in my portfolio and quick reasoning behind my picks.

Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7mk3j0/quick_dds_for_my_entire_portfolio/?utm_source=reddit-android

I was met with some usual smart assery about how it wasn't actual dd or how I was wrong in my picks because their logic is more smarter. Psh. So basically nothing substantive that I could seriously consider.

Moving on. Here is an update to my portfolio, what stocks I held, what stocks I swing traded, what stocks I sold, what stocks I had mentioned in my previous post that were missed opportunities.

To start off: (not doing dd on them again, read previous post)

MARK: Bought in around 9.75s, then bought more at at mid 11s then a very small portion at low 13s. Started selling off when it reached high 13's.

Made roughly 30% gain on MARK. No longer own any of it. SUCCESS 

SQ: Switched this out with MJX because I thought itd be at least 1-2 months before it started going up again and wanted to make a quick buck off MJX. MJX started buying in at mid 31's and decided to sell off around 36, made roughly 20% profit when I could have made around the same with SQ if I kept it (bought SQ at 35s) NEUTRAL.

MSFT: Got impatient, sold it off because I wanted to invest the money into more volatile growth stocks. Still a good pick though. NEUTRAL.

KEM: Had someone saying this was a bad pick on the post because it was a commodity, bought in at low 15s, more at high 16s and then even more at high 16s. Will sell half before earnings, half will sell after. Up 20% so far. SUCCESS

ETP: My sell off point for this was if it hit 20 a share. Bought in high 17s sold off high 19s. 10% profit. Mediocre but still SUCCESS.

MOMO: My favorite Chinese growth stock along with BITA. Someone said to ditch MOMO in the previous thread but I said no thank you. It's been giving slow gains but I'm very confident about it. Bought in at 25s, up 10% so far. SUCCESS.

BITA: God I wish I had more money to have bought into this, this is another company I am very confident about. At one point I had bought in at 29s but kept swing trading when it hit 32s for quick buck. Bought in today at 37s again.

TEUM: Really good company with a bright future, management is doing all they can to expand business and increase shareholder value. I originally had bought in at .71 and sold at 1.35s a few months back. I now bought in 275 at mid 2.30s. I believe this can reach around 6-8$ by end of year.

Overall portfolio up 30% since New Years

I did upgrade and now use 2k margin additionally

Does this change the nature of a potential gap-fill?  I have thought about this a lot and wondering about what others think.  I realize that gaps don't always fill, but I read that only 10% of gaps don't fill.

With a forward 2019 p/e of 47.98 P/E, it seems that they are pretty much priced for perfection. Already meeting most analysts' PT (doesn't mean too much, but hey its a datapoint)

If the price already reflects the grand expectations of the company, the upside seems way too small in comparison to the risk of them underperforming. Even if they continue to perform relatively well, how far can they run up with its current valuations? 

It seems like NVDA is currently trading under the ""castle-in-the-air"" theory (where the intrinsic value of the stock becomes irrelevant). I suppose the same thing can be said about AMZN, but look how its doing..

My portfolio was getting lopsided with tech and financials, and I needed the diversification, especially with the upcoming breakup.  But aside from the future split into three companies (all three of which I have faith in after looking at the success of previous spinoffs from Dow and/or Dupont--i.e. Chemours), there is one thing in particular that told me this was the time to buy.  Institutional buying is exploding on this stock from what I can tell, and following the money has led to success in the past.  Sure, the p/e is high and there has already been a solid rally, but it is early in the merger, and the price has barely touched the previous highs of Dupont pre-merge.  

Obviously, past performance has no bearing on future returns, but Dow and Dupont were both strong companies, and it stands to reason that a combination of the two is one worth betting on for the long-term.

There was a thread here (or possibly in r/investing) the other day explaining how there is no point in doing research on large caps since the Street knows better already.  So, sure, I wasted a lot of time reading the reports on DWDP, I guess, but the pros seem bullish, materials is a space generating a lot of investor interest thanks to supposed infrastructure plans and the tax bill, and this company is a potential money printing machine.

InsanelyReasonable;1516489927;7rtw7a;;2;;0;"If you're informed about psychiatry you know that, as it stands today, objective ways of actually measuring real biomarkers that say something about a persons mental health are largely missing. 


Diagnosis depends almost exclusively on the psychiatrist's judgment call based on observation of behavior, interviews with relatives and anamnesis.


This is a major weakness in psychiatry and something that has led to it being regarded as a somewhat lesser medical discipline compared to more rigidly empirical specialities. Not to mention how these less precise, and costly, ways of making a diagnosis can adversely affect the patient, put a strain on the healthcare system, as well as increase the societal costs (long investigation periods, trying different treatments, longer recovery etc).


The Swedish biotech company [SensoDetect](http://sensodetect.com/) has a validated and functioning method of actually measuring activity in the brain stem that is indicative of psychiatric conditions.


It is called brain-stem audiometry and works by measuring the way in which the brain stem processes sounds. Researchers at Uppsala University recently found that the method was [highly effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28803577) in detecting schizophrenia and ADHD, two major psychiatric diagnoses. I cite the results of the study:


*""The ABR profiling test for schizophrenia identified schizophrenia patients versus controls with a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 93.1%. The ADHD test identified patients with adult ADHD versus controls with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 91.4%.""*


SensoDetect's method is meant to function as a tool for psychiatrists to let them make more informed and effective diagnoses. It is also very comfortable for the patients; they listen to sounds in headphones for about 15 minutes, and the computer analyses how the brain stem processes the sounds through electrodes placed on the patient's head.


SensoDetect has successfully patented this technology in the USA, China, Japan, Canada, Australia, France, Germany and most of Europe.


In December SensoDetect signed a LOI with a distributor in South Korea. They also cooperate with researchers in the UK, Germany and Sweden.


Today, the company is valued at only $4M. Considering the huge market potential, the independent research results and the patent portfolio, that seems like a bargain to me (although with high risk).

**$ARRY** or Array Biopharma is a clinical stage immunooncology company founded in 1998. [They have a diverse pipeline](http://www.arraybiopharma.com/product-pipeline/) with 5 drugs in phase 3 of development. One of the first things I noticed about their pipeline was that they have a lot of partnerships with companies like Celgene, Roche, Loxe, ASLAN etc. They only have 2 drugs in the pipeline they fully own. But they have good deals in place that will give them milestone payments to keep the company afloat. I am bullish on $ARRY and I believe they have enormous potential and I’ll list a few reasons why I think that.


1. MASSIVE pipeline backed by big Pharma companies with excellent results.

2. Upcoming PDUFA of Binimetinib - COLUMBUS a BRAF mutant melanoma cancer drug on June 30th (partnered with Pierre Fabre). [It is excellent tolerability and safety compared to its competitor vemurafinib](http://www.arraybiopharma.com/index.php/download_file/269/). No ADCOM is expected so expect to see this approved. Binimetinib - BEACON which is a combination of Binimetinib And Encorafenib for metastatic colorectal cancer results came out with its phase two results with solid results on [Saturday January 20th](http://www.arraybiopharma.com/download_file/282/). The overall response rate for 16 patients was 62% and there were three complete responses. This drug will move onto phase 3. Both products are in collaboration with Pierre Fabre who provided [$ARRY with 30 million upfront and will provide $425 million in additional milestones](http://investor.arraybiopharma.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=123810&amp;p=RssLanding&amp;cat=news&amp;id=2112588).

3. Upcoming NDA with Danoprevir (partnered with Roche) a HepC drug. Its in phase 3 in China but an NDA submitted in China. Not much money here only $5 million, but money is money and it looks [promising](https://www.healio.com/hepatology/hepatitis-c/news/online/%7Bc2e5cdbe-2934-4612-b182-296a0dc87438%7D/asian-patients-achieve-svr-with-ravidasvir-ritonavir-danoprevir-ribavirin-combo)

4. Phase 3 trial results in 2018 of Ipatasertib, a breast cancer drug, to be presented this year. It uses the AKT pathway so its novel and has a [better progression free survival](http://www.cancernetwork.com/asco-breast-cancer/ipatasertib-modestly-prolongs-pfs-triple-negative-breast-cancer) than placebo. Honestly, the response rate and everything is only slightly better than current drugs. But it is better.

5. A decent amount of phase 2 and phase 1 drugs with triggers in 2018 like GDC-0575(partnered with Genentech with a potential [$380 million in milestone payments](http://www.arraybiopharma.com/product-pipeline/other-compounds/gdc-0575/)), ARRY-382 (PD-1 receptor drug) partnered with Merck’s Keytruda (itself a $1 billion drug that is set to be approved this summer), ARRY-382 (breast cancer drug) which has shown [good initial data](http://www.arraybiopharma.com/index.php/download_file/218/) has two readouts this year and ARRY-797 which has shown [potential so far](http://www.arraybiopharma.com/index.php/download_file/245/)

6. [They have money](http://investor.arraybiopharma.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=123810&amp;p=irol-SECText&amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2FwaS50ZW5rd2l6YXJkLmNvbS9maWxpbmcueG1sP2lwYWdlPTExODYxNDkyJkRTRVE9MCZTRVE9MCZTUURFU0M9U0VDVElPTl9FTlRJUkUmc3Vic2lkPTU3#s1C70406362E652158BF41E557841219F). They ended the year with $235 million in cash. Their revenue did slow down and their debt increased slightly but that is due to their increase in R&amp;D. With a potential $600 million for milestone targets of Binimetinib and Encorafenib still in the works [alongside massive royalty sales for COLUMBUS](https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/04269X/20170830/AR_334678.PDF), the future is secure for this company.

Now the more iffy news: 

1. Not many triggers in 2018 (maybe a total of 6). The majority of the triggers will not cause the price to move a lot. The big exception being the PDUFA in June.

2. Heavily shorted. Resistance at 13.20, 13.54 and 13.55. Support at 10.92.

3. Waiting for news, there was news on January 20th upon good results on BEACON, but with the government shutdown, I don’t know what will happen when market opens.

4. Currently a one trick pony. Plenty of drugs in the pipeline, but they are all a few years away. Their future hinges on Binimetinib. I have no doubt it will be approved by the FDA, but there is a possibility that something like $ATRS happens where the company forgot something on the label and the stock tanked even though the drug itself is fine.

---

However, this is a good company. It has an impressive pipeline and money coming in from various partners. I’d say this is a buy (especially anything around $12) and I think based on the triggers alone it might reach $20 by the end of the year.

provoko;1516526086;7rwsgp;;93;;104;"The reason why we have a rule against crypto discussions is because this is r/stocks where we discuss stocks.

Last year we had a surge of comments that were literally ""buy bitcoin"" in almost every single post on r/stocks, and it wasn't just a single comment, sometimes you would find 10 users stating the exact same thing, ""buy bitcoin"" or going into details on how to mine bitcoins; this is spam &amp; off topic.

Also Bitcoin is not a stock, just like discussing buying &amp; reselling sneakers is not a stock, these discussions are off topic and that reason alone was enough to remove posts &amp; comments.  Unfortunately this wasn't enough, so we created a rule (see sidebar) against discussing crypto with a link to a sub where you could; we also made an automod rule to deal with this.

If you want to discuss investing in general, you can go to r/investing, which is mentioned in the sidebar (on mobile by tapping ""about this community"").  If you want to discuss crypto &amp; mining you can go to r/CryptoCurrency.

Below is the automod message I wrote, **please give me your criticism &amp; feedback on this**.  I made it informative to deal with some misconceptions &amp; misinformation (including GPU mining).

You can also see that when a stock is related to crypto, **I've whitelisted that stock (including this post) so you can discuss crypto** as long as that discussion is related to the stock (or this post), so it's not 100% removal; it also only affects top level comments:

*****

Sorry your comment (link to comment) in /r/stocks was automatically removed as per **rule 6:  Bitcoins &amp; cryptocurrenies should be discussed in r/CryptoCurrency.**

This probably only affects your comment if it was a top level suggestion.  **Keep in mind this is r/stocks and people come here for stock suggestions.**

We've whitelisted some discussions on crypto, but not all such as **bitcoin &amp; crypto holding ETFs and futures (explanation below)**.  However **we allow crypto discussions on the following:** Coinbase IPO, Square INC, Overstock, XNET, MARA, GCAP, and Kodak; this list will always be updated (see below to what won't be included).

A list of the [rules can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/rules/), and if you're new to r/stocks please see the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and/or [read this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4x1419/if_youre_new_here_read_this_post_first/)

If you're just wondering if cryptocoins are an investment, [read here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/are-cryptocurrencies-investments)

**Please note:**

* GBTC, BTSC &amp; other crypto holding ETFs don't function like other commodity ETFs like USO &amp; GLD.  GBTC &amp; BTSC are overvalued, inefficient, trade on Over The Counter exchange, and unregulated.  Within a 5 day period where Bitcoins went up 43% for the week of Dec 4th 2017 while GBTC dropped 7% and BTSC fell a whopping 61% (people calling BTSC a scam is not an exaggeration).
* **AMD, NVDA, VISA are not affected by bitcoins**; GPU mining died in 2013 and since then everyone has switched to ASIC mining, check for your self [with this website.](http://whattomine.com/); some analysts say only 5% of GPU sales are related to crypto mining.
 * VISA transactions are around **$10 trillion** while we don't have a dollar value of retail crypto transactions, we have per second retail volume of bitcoin + eth = 14 per second vs VISA at 4471 per second (based on 2016, [source](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/about-visa/documents/visa-facts-figures-jan-2017.pdf)), source for [crypto transactions.](https://cryptovoices.com/transaction-volume/).
* CBOE Bitcoin futures (XBT) &amp; CME Bitcoin futures are not stocks and don't affect the stock market like other commodities:
 * Oil futures affect the stock market because the energy industry depends heavily on the price of oil.
 * Price of gold, copper, steel, and other metals affect several industries &amp; their respective stocks, not to mention gold is an indicator for fear/safe-haven and affects stock indexes.
 * As of 12/2017, there is not a single publicly traded company that depends on the price of cryptocurrencies.  **As that changes I'll whitelist those specific stocks until** there's a recognized sector and I'll release the floodgates of posts.  Until then, see r/cryptomarkets, r/TheWallStreet, or r/Commodities.
*  If you're wondering if a crypto crash could affect the stock market, lets put things into perspective: Bitcoin &amp; crytpocurrency market caps are still less than 1% of the stock market at around half a trillion (12/2017) while gold is at 7 trillion, the s&amp;p at 22.5 trillion, and residential real estate at 34 trillion; not to mention bonds &amp; global real estate reduce everything I just mentioned into fractions.

Antibe Therapeutics trades on the CVE as $ATE not on NASDAQ. It was founded in 2009 and produces anti-inflammatory drugs. NSAIDs have a huge market cap ($1.5B) also evidenced by the fact that these are easily obtainable drugs that most people know of like Advil and Aspirin. However most NSAIDs tend to cause either liver or gastric distress. Antibe’s drugs standout by eliminating any gastric distress while performing as well as established NSAIDs. However after looking at the pros and cons, its too early to tell if this is going to be a multi-million dollar company or it will go bust. Therefore, for me it falls under the wait and see approach. Of course you could have a punt on it if you like to gamble because the potential increase at this price is remarkable.

Pros:

1. ATB-346 (Naproxen alternative) with strong phase 2 results with showing pain relief double that of Naproxen but without any GI disturbances.
2. ATB-346 safety and efficacy triggers in 1Q 2018 and 4Q 2018 with potential global partner deals in 2018.
Good business model of creating medical devices and licensing them off to fund the drugs sector.
3. ATB-352 (non addictive analgesic drug) showed good GI results in rats

Cons:

1. Breaking into an already established field and competing with big hitters like Pfizer and Bayer.
2. All drugs in early development and some while before they will reach the market. The money question will remain on their head in the meantime.
3. Not enough scientific or clinical data yet so hard to tell if the drugs are any better than their competitors
4. Medical devices in preclinical phase as well.

Unfortunately, its very hard to do a medical based DD on a company that hasn’t had any clinical results out. A majority of their drugs are in development with only ATB-346 the closest to the market but it is still in phase 2. Facts are their debt will continue to increase and their revenue will continue to decrease. Partnership and licensing deals will have to keep them afloat all the way into 2020 for them to be a viable company. 

And then there are the questions whether Antibe will be able to compete with the big boys of pharma once they do come out with a few drugs. If you do decide to take a gamble, look for a price near $0.15.

I would pick IRBT over any stock right now but DYODD.  They have been looking really good for the long haul, it has the potential to go from 2.5b to 250b. in my opinion. Their financials are looking very positive. They are up y/y, they have no debt, they are making profit, they are sitting on a bunch of cash. Sales on amazon are up and prices are increasing due to demand. They are only breaking the surface on home robotics where only about 1% of consumers currently use a robot. Not to mention they havnt even released many products on the works. The owners are from MIT. I personally seen the business right near Boston. 
All the big companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon will most likely integrate their Products as opposed to creating their own home robots. As these big companies go well over a trillion in the years coming 250b won’t be too much for a big home robotics company. I will continue to add stocks this year.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I see it falling back below $11.78 after earnings which would produce another lower swing high and test back to the bottom of the trending channel in the $9.50 area. Until this breaks above $16 or below $9.50, play the trading range.

The good news for AMD holders is while the price isn't breaking out, volume, which often precedes price, is breaking out.

denach644;1516650299;7s8dj1;Advice Request;5;;1;"Heya folks.  
  
Young guy here. Started working a real job a couple years ago, and my parents hooked me up with our long time Investors Group lady. Shortly after opening an account with them, monthly deposits and all, I began looking into stock trading and used extra money to dabble. I've been enjoying it thus far.  
  
Now, I recently got my 1/4ly statement from IG regarding my fund, which has a considerable amount of money now (for me) and it only netted me a $30 return in a conservative IG Mutual Fund. The original plan was for something stable to grow my money towards buying a house, but this is a whole other result from 'grow' than what I was expecting. It's quite literally a .001% return for the quarter, or if these trends continue, .004% over a year. I think IG has made more money off me than I ended up pocketing... The money I did make from this account is beyond laughable compared to my fractional investments into stocks, which have netted me considerably better returns.  
  
**My question is this:** If I were to invest in stable, blue chip stocks (AMZN, BABA, HD, LOW, FB, GOOGL, etc etc), would this be a reasonable practice in order to help jump start myself towards building money towards a house? I've already got some money invested in the market from place to place, mostly feeling around but doing okay thus far, so I feel like I could have good judgement on what blue chips to pick. My real question is whether or not blue chips would be too much added risk compared to a conservative fund through an institution? I'm thinking it would be acceptable, since I could get a considerably higher return and maintain some stability, but I would like further opinions on the matter.

**$ATRA** or Atara Biotherapeutics is a T-cell immunotherapy company developing novel treatments for patients with cancer and multiple sclerosis. It is the current ‘hot’ topic in biotech as illustrated with the news that Celgene wants to buy Juno. T-cells are engineered from donors with healthy immune function and allow for delivery from inventory to patients in 3 to 5 days without a requirement for pretreatment. 

Their current [pipeline](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/) is diverse. It includes [ATA129](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/ata129/) (a drug targeting cancer patients with rituximab-refractory Epstein-Barr virus and its variants), [ATA188](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/ata188/) (for the treatment of Multiple sclerosis), [ATA230](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/ata230/) (for CMV), [ATA520](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/ata520/) (Wilms tumor 1), [ATA621](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/preclinical-programs/)(BK virus (not that common)) and [ATA368](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/preclinical-programs/)(HPV). Most of the drugs are novel and cutting age and have pretty good results so far. [Here](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/56/2/277/837426) is a nice scientific article about the treatment of EBV, where no drug is found to target it specifically but ATA129 does.

As I type this out its currently $34.30 up 16.27% on the day and up from $18 since the start of 2018. So does this mean you have missed the run for the year? In my opinion, no. In fact this companies pipeline and potential make me think there is a lot left in the tank and I’ll try and hash out the reasons why I think so.

**Pros**:

1. Diverse pipeline with cutting edge drugs developed from T-cell tech that is currently ‘hot’ in biotech (CART).

2. ATA129, recently gone into [phase 3 trials](http://investors.atarabio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/atara-biotherapeutics-announces-initiation-two-phase-3-clinical), has [shown](https://ash.confex.com/ash/2017/webprogram/Paper107933.html) good results. There was an 80-100% objective response rate. In clinical trials, [“…Treatment with ATA129 resulted in one-year overall survival of approximately 60% in two separate clinical trials in comparison with historical data where median survival, or the time by which 50% of patients had died, was 16-56 days. In the setting of rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after SOT, similar results were observed, with one-year overall survival of approximately 60% in ATA129-treated patients in comparison with an expected historical one-year survival of 36% in patients with high risk disease similar to the patients treated in the trials.”](https://atarabio.gcs-web.com/node/9376/html#Balance_Sheets). It has showed efficacy and safety moving into phase 3 trials. This year Atara will submit a CMA for ATA129 with phase 3 data in 1Q 2019 and pursue a PDUFA 4Q 2019 or 1Q 2020.

3. ATA129 collaboration with Merck’s KEYTRUDA for nasopharyngeal carcinoma to be initiated this year. I have mentioned before how great this drug is but this drug is the [real deal.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180116005680/en/Mercks-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-Significantly-Improved-Survival-Progression-Free). Apart from it being considered a [“$16 billion drug](https://www.barrons.com/articles/merck-is-keytruda-a-16b-drug-1508351281) a collaboration into a [rare cancer](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/nasopharyngeal-cancer/statistics) with a proven drug in an area where no other such drug exists means a lot of money. 

4. ATA188 (currently in phase 2 safety and efficacy trials) showed [very promising]http://cme-utilities.com/mailshotcme/Abstracts/Oral-Program-Sessions-270317_2.pdf) data. Six of ten progressive MS patients in the Phase 1 trial experienced clinical improvements. Reduced fatigue was also reported (which if you know anything about MS, is a big deal). A secondary drug ATA190 is also being tested alongside ATA188 for EBV related MS showing a strong correlation.

5. ATA520 recently [presented interim phase 1 results](http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/126/23/98?sso-checked=true). The one year response was greater than 60%, two patients with complete responses remained in remission for one year and no adverse effects were recorded. AT520 has two phase 1 results (one on dose escalation safety, the other on dose escalation with drug resistant multiple myeloma) this year.

6. Numerous triggers in 2018 including ATA230 phase 2 trial results [1Q 2018](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02136797), ATA520 phase 1 results [1Q 2018](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00620633) and [4Q2018](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01758328), Preclinical trial results from ATA621, ATA368 and ATA274 and keytruda combo initiation news. Not to mention the 2019 triggers that include phase 3 results for ATA129, ATA188 results, NDA submissions, licensing and partnership news.

7. Recent PT upgrade to $70.

**Cons**: 

1. Enormous amount of dumping lately with majority of insiders selling(-12%). That coupled with its recent run and RSI at 87 hints at an incoming correction. 

2. [Increasing debt ($261 million), increased operating activities and no current source of revenue](https://atarabio.gcs-web.com/node/9376/html#Balance_Sheets)

3. Most drugs in development are in phase 2 or below.

4. Support at $28.25


**TL;DR**: This is a company with potential and something I’ll keep my eye on. It doesn’t have a product ready to sell yet, but when it does its going to be very lucrative for the investor. It's either going to be a buyout by a bigger company ala $CELG and $JUNO or a very well placed company with revenue and a likely stock price that reflects it.

(Not only, because of course US market is a huge deal, but that uses euro and such instead of dollars for everything as I am buying my stocks from an EU broker). 

Also if anyone knows a good audio book / podcast that explains all the basics (terms, ideas, concepts, etc.) that would be super helpful as well. I've been starting to listen a lot to different podcast (motley fool among others) and they use all these terms that I have heard, but I don't want to sit and google every time I hear a new one. :D,   
So any tips for something that teaches me the basics would be incredibly helpful! :)

I prefer audio since I can listen on the train on my way to work, but if there is only reading material I would of course love to hear that as well. ";;Audio book / Podcast learning the basic terms and EU stock market?;

dabears_24;1516733034;7sglx0;Question;3;;0;"So I'm new to investing and trying to make sure I understand the significance of earnings reports properly. My basic understanding is that reported EPS being higher than projected EPS results in positive outlook on a stock (and essentially some increase in price).

However, one stock I am specifically looking at, NVMI, dropped about 20% the day of its last earnings report, 11/01/17, even though reported EPS was 16.2% above projections. My only guesses for this drop are that EPS decreased from the previous quarter (although the projections should have already priced that in), or the surprise % went from 30 the previous Q to 16 this quarter.

Still, I'm not sure what I'm missing because a 20% drop seems drastic for a positive earnings report.

At the time, I knew nothing about investing and my dad told me to take advantage of the company stock purchase plan. The stock was on a pretty steady climb up and he thought it was going to continue.

I know a little about investing, but not enough to truly understand all of the public financial information that's available. That being said, it was a terribly run company when I was there.

CainRedfield;1516758745;7sjpf7;;30;;85;"Everyone always talks about whether or not to go long/short before the earnings announcement. Everyone is always thinking about opening a position before the announcement, and I am not here to say this is a bad strategy or a wrong one. I just wanted to talk about a less mentioned strategy that I feel is more reliable than opening positions to ""bet"" on earnings.

Just wait. Sit on your hands and wait. Wait until earnings are released, and watch Wall Street go crazy over the news. Be reactive to earnings, not anticipatory. In a bull market like we have been in for the last month or so, going short is probably ill advised just due to so many stocks rocketing up and few actually going down a meaningful amount. **BUT** there are still traders that are overreacting to ""bad earnings"" or some form of earnings disappointment and selling off stocks. And it's not that the lowering of the price is unwarranted per se, it's that it is over-exaggerated. 

If there is one thing I've learned from trading in the market, it's that people overreact, all the time. Panic sparks panic and the weak traders that don't even consider market psychology and their own psychology fall prey to so many different psychological processes that they may not even be aware of. And because of this companies are often oversold due to news events, analyst predictions, and biggest of all, **earnings releases.**

So the way that I personally like to trade and make my profits around earnings are to watch all the large caps, and some mid caps and how the stocks react after earnings, and if I feel they have been oversold, I will go long when a bottom or support is forming and when the price action has begun to reverse. I'm not always right (still always have stop losses) but I typically find it fairly easy to do well around earnings because humans do tend to fall prey to fear and sell stocks that should not be sold. So by doing the opposite of the market there is a lot of potential profit to be made. 

The only point to this post really is to get some people thinking critically about earnings releases and the price action that proceeds them, and instead of only thinking of buying or selling before earnings, start thinking about buying or selling after earnings to take advantage of the downfalls in our own natural psychology and biases. 

Earnings season has only just begun, but to give you an idea of places to start, GS is the perfect example of quick easy money after earnings. I sold a credit spread on the 17th and closed for 95% of the credit profit on the 22nd. IBM has also panned out well but I haven't quite closed that one yet. Looking forward, I'm keeping an eye out on PG and JNJ today, as well as already having opened a position in AXP.

Hope this gives you something to think about, and I'm sure you'll be able to find many opportunities that I didn't list and that I may not even be aware of. Good luck! ";;How to Make Money During Earnings Season;

Net revenue was slightly higher than expected at $3.75 billion, topping the $3.74 billion that analysts were calling for. The figure rose 9.8% compared to the year-ago mark.

Snight;1516810239;7so4ci;Ticker Discussion;72;;97;"Bullish on electric cars / automated driving? Tencent owns 5% of Tesla and a $1.6 billion stake in the Chinese up-start, NIO. 

Bullish on e-Commerce / ePayment solutions / in-app payment? Tencent owns 20% of JD.com and a stake in Vipshop. They, of course, operate WeChat, QQZone and QQ - combined these have MAU of 980 million. Within each of these, they have finance solutions, the biggest being WeChat Pay - part of which is contributing to the 143% Year on Year revenue growth for their other business department (featuring their payment business and Cloud business). 

Did you say you like The Cloud? Don't tell me that you like AI technology, too? 

Tencent owns two AI startup labs. They also run Tencent Cloud - a cloud services provider that has access to the best advertisement machine in China: Tencent's (aforementioned) social media portfolio. 


Now, I know what you're thinking right now:

""Who is this guy, u/snight, with all of these circumstantial and qualitative comments? This isn't fundamental analysis; this is bullshit!"" 
 
Well, to those of you who like to invest on more than just trends, let me posit this: 

Apart from their massive moat, a wealth of investments and insane social media portfolio. (Oh, they also have 43 million subscribers to Tencent video and a growing investment into revenue based literature and music platforms). They also achieved 61% YoY quarterly revenue growth and 45% net profit growth. They have a P/E of only 60, and a forward P/E of 40. They also have USD 13 billion in cash. Ma Huateng - or, as I like to call him, the one true Ma - has silently, steadily and overwhelmingly built up an empire of investments upon layers upon layers of IP with access to one of the biggest user base in the world. 

My last comment is food for thought, and to me, it summarises the entire philosophy of Tencent. You may know that WeChat is a social media platform, I haven't fully fleshed out how you can walk into a store, and (through WeChat) the automated payment technology can [register](http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2130062/tencent-beats-amazon-launch-unmanned-shop-lags-other-chinese-tech) what you pick up and charge it straight to your phone without you needing to talk to anyone or scan anything. What I haven't yet mentioned is Tencent's apps within apps. Tencent offers an in-app ""app store"", and they now offer [more apps or ""mini-apps"" than Apple's AppStore.](http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2129987/tencent-takes-aim-apple-and-google-app-stores-wechat-mini-program-push).

blackdragon1299;1516810249;7so4ds;Ticker Discussion;26;;15;"Here's my monthly post on 3 positions I'm looking to buy/add in Feb. I already have positions in all 3 of these, and currently TTWO is looking great to add more to. Let me know what your picks for Feb are and as usual, if you prefer this in video format, [you can find it here](https://youtu.be/eiJgP6hwQE4)


* 1) TTWO - Take-two Interactive
One of the largest gaming companies in the world. They have popular games like Grand Theft Auto and the 2K Sports Series (like NBA 2K). Their main competitors are ATVI, EA, and somewhat Tencent (League of Legends). TTWO will be reporting earnings on Feb 7th after hours, and analysts are expecting a consensus EPS for this quarter at $0.84. The same quarter last year came in at an EPS of $0.71, so this would be substantial growth. They have also beat the past 4 ERs and I don't expect this to be any different as we just had the holiday season, and that is typically good for gaming companies as a lot of people buy games as gifts, etc. The technicals here is what really caught my attention. It's currently stuck in a range which I believe will be broken either with an earnings run up, or after they report their earnings.


* 2) ADSK - Autodesk Inc.
They are a software company that makes tools for engineers and architects for CAD modelling design. They don't really have any large competitors as far as I can tell. Adobe could be considered one, but Adobe focuses more on design tools for web designers, artists, etc. so I don't see them as a direct competitor. I believe Autodesk has a good niche here and they will keep growing here. Their earnings are expected Feb 27th (not confirmed) and analysts have a high target for this (most are $120+). They are pushing a subscription model - The subscription revenues soared 105.6% year over year to $231.1 million in last quarter and total subscriptions increased 146K from prior quarter to 3.6M in the quarter. For this earnings, they expect revenues in the range of $537–$547 million. They revised their full-year revenue and EPS expectations and increased to $2.040-$2.050 billion vs prior guidance of $2.030–$2.040 billion. Projects subscription additions to be between 625K and 650K compared with the prior guidance of 625K and 675K. Their technicals again caught my attention - that gap! They dropped on their last earnings and have been flat since then, but I think we will make a run before the next earnings to attempt to fill out this gap. This is more of a technical play here than a fundamental so be warned that you may be holding this longer than expected for this to play out.


* 3) SQ - Square Inc.
Square is a mobile payment company and are popular with small businesses as their tool allows them to use their phone/iPad as a payment device. Customers can then pay via CC (Mastercard, Visa, Amex, etc.) using this device which opens up the door to more customers (previously only cash or debit). Square not only sells the device, but also takes a pay cut from each transaction. Their earnings are expected on Feb 21 (not confirmed) and analysts haven't really had many upgrades on the stock since it hit $50 and dropped back down so I feel we will see a lot of upgrades come in as we approach earnings and/or once they report earnings. The technicals show that since that drop back in late November, the stock has been consolidating (healthy) and recently there has been some good news and rumours surrounding the stock (like American Express AXP interested in buying them) which has refueled it in a sense and has sent it back in a rally on good volume.
 

So these are my 3 picks for February. There are plenty of companies reporting earnings so keep your eyes peeled. Let us know what positions you are adding/holding through February and how you did in January with your positions in the comments below! Happy Investing!";;3 Stocks to Watch/Buy in Feb 2018;

*****

&gt; * President Trump's State of the Union Speech, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's final meeting, and a wave of earnings and economic news will give markets plenty of catalysts in the week ahead.
&gt; * Analysts are watching for an asset reallocation by pension funds.
* Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet all report Wednesday and Thursday.
&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 7 percent for the month so far, its best performance since 2015.

*****

&gt; President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's farewell meeting and a tsunami of earnings reports from tech's heaviest hitters are some of the big events for markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; The stock market could continue its record-setting run as month end approaches, and the S&amp;P 500 is already on track for a 7.2 percent January gain so far, its best gain since October 2015. If positive, January would be the 10th month of gains for the Dow and S&amp;P, the best consecutive monthly winning streak since 1959.
*****
&gt; Stock investors will focus on a range of events, including President Trump's State of the Union address and his expected promise of a major infrastructure spending plan. The president is expected to ask Congress for $200 billion.
*****
&gt; More than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies release earnings, with reports from Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet on Wednesday and Thursday, and from big oil, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, on Friday.
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady Wednesday, in the final meeting before Chair Janet Yellen leaves at the end of the week and Fed governor Jerome Powell moves to the chairmanship. The Fed is expected to raise rates again in March, and it forecasts three interest rate hikes this year.
*****
&gt; ""I suspect there's not going to be a massive change. Their views are going to be about the same. You will definitely see more conversation about regulation from him,"" said Seth Carpenter, UBS chief U.S. economist.
*****
&gt; There are also some major data releases in the coming week, as the calendar rolls to February from January, with car sales, manufacturing and productivity data Thursday and the always important monthly employment report on Friday.
*****
&gt; The roll of the calendar itself could be a big event, as investors position for the end of a month where stocks soared and bonds sold off. Some strategists expect to see a continued reallocation from pension funds, which set their allocations in January. Treasury bonds have sold off, with the 10-year yield reaching close to its high of 2.47 percent Friday, and the 2-year piercing 2.13 percent, after starting the year at 1.89. Yields move opposite prices.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC:**
February’s performance generally improves in midterm years**

&gt; Since 1950, February is up only slightly more than half the time and up marginally on average. However, small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the seventh best month for that benchmark.

&gt; In midterm years, February’s performance generally improves with average returns all increasing. Here again it is the Russell 2000 small-cap index that shines brightest gaining 1.9% on average since 1982. Russell 1000 is second best, averaging gains of 1.3% since 1982. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 average gains of 1.0% (since 1950) while NASDAQ lags with average advance of 0.7% (since 1974).

# **The Energizer Market**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 notched yet another new all-time high today. Below is an updated look at our tables highlighting the length of days it has been since the last meaningful pullback.

&gt; As shown, we’re now at 445 days since the last 3%+ pullback (a record), 575 days since the last 5%+ pullback (18 days from a record), 712 days since the last 10%+ pullback (not close to a record), and 3,242 days since the last 20%+ pullback (2nd longest).

# **Another 100+ Trading Day Streak Without a 1%+ Decline**

&gt; We’ve been saying this for a while now, but the next time the S&amp;P 500 experiences a drop of more than 1%, it’s going to feel like a crash to many investors. That’s because 1%+ down days have become so foreign lately. As investors get used to only very small declines on very rare occasions, drops of 1%-2% — which were much more frequent up until the end of 2016 — feel MUCH more painful when they finally do occur.

&gt; Below is a chart showing historical streaks of trading days without a 1%+ down day going back to 1945. While the current streak of 108 trading days isn’t that close to the record streak of 184 trading days seen back in 1963, it’s notable that we just had a 109-trading day streak end last March as well.

&gt; Prior to the two recent 100+ trading day streaks without a 1%+ down day, the last two came back in 1995. 1995 was a year that saw very similar action to what we’ve seen over the last 12 months.

###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1pcttradingdays.png))**

&gt; If we tighten up the margin of the decline even more, the S&amp;P 500 has not had a decline of 0.60% in 96 trading days. As shown below, that’s easily a record going back to 1945!

Have a fantastic weekend r/stocks! :)";;Stock Market Discussion Thread for the trading week beginning January 29th, 2018;
Owntano;1517063468;7tczok;;237;;112;"I transferred my 401k from my old job to my IRA so that I could manage it.  I'm a huge fan of amazon and believe the analysts when they say their target price will still grow. I was reluctant to buy their stock at 600, why not now?

I actually made a similar decision a year ago about Google stock: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5uoilj/7k_to_invest_long_term_thinking_about_getting/";;10k Cash to invest long term. Thinking about dropping it all on AMZN. Where do I put it?;

Lot of analysts I've read on it feel this way too .. ""How often does one find a dominant market leader with 20%-plus return on equity trading at only seven times earnings?"" asks Ben Preston, who heads global sector investment at London's Orbis Investments""

Only thing I'm worried about is it is Russian and Russians aren't exactly the most popular people in the US or worldwide for that matter. The financials look great for this bank though, so did I make the right move in getting into it you think?";;Just got into Sberbank (SBRCY);

Last night they had a sale 75% off their stock advisor program, $50 for the year. I figured it was a good buy so I’m now a member.

TRichard3814;1517080319;7tetui;Discussion;3;;0;"I'm 1-7 years old currently and I started investing in weed stocks around 1.5-2 years ago with about half my money (2k in Canopy growth corporation and 1k in aurora). Fast forward to now a lot of good investments and industry diversification and I have about 23k (100% of money) invested into the marijuana industry.


I'm hoping to use this money to build a retirement fund because of the beautiful power of compounding and dividend reinvestment. My university will likely be payed for by my family and I'm hoping I can use this money (along with savings) to retire at 55-60.


My question is when should I take profit, the beauty of compound interest means if I can increase my porftolio 1k this year it's gonna be like 7k when I cash it out 40 years from now. I firmly believe in the overall industry however I can't say I believe in the valuations of current companies.


Some more background:
-Money is in fathers TFSA (so it's tax free)
- currently have $10 in bank account
Portfolio:
6k THCX
4K MARI
3.5k OGI warrants
2.6k WEED
2.2k APH
1.8k FIRE
1.8k HVST
1.8k TGIF
1.2k IMH
1k MPX
0.8k Antibe Therapeutics (ATE)
0.5k NINE warrants


I have decided to go with one of four options and would appreciate some input.


1.Try and get to 50k then pull out 35k and put it into market ETF's while keeping the other 15k in the weed stocks.

2. Try and get to 50k then put everything into market ETF's

3. Take half out now and put it into market ETF's and let the rest of the money ride

4. Let everything ride in Weedstocks but diversify and own the ETF primarily

Viridian_Hawk;1517166625;7tmaq6;;0;;1;"I've read about how ETFs are much more liquid than their average daily volume would suggest thanks to ""Authorized Participants"" (APs). Essentially, if there is a increased demand or supply, shares can be created or destroyed by APs in exchange for the underlying assets. So in theory if you place an order, you don't necessarily need to cross the spread in order for it to fill, you just need to cross NAV. However, such in-kind exchanges by APs are done in very large lots, so the ETF price could theoretically veer quite a bit from NAV before it makes sense for them to do such an exchange. Also, since APs essentially profit on the spread between SP and NAV, it's in their interest to let that spread grow as large as possible before cashing in on it. For example, XIV, despite being one of the most liquid ETFs, recently hit over 5% premium to NAV.

So it doesn't seem particularly clear to me how to gauge the liquidity risk of ETFs, especially low volume ETF with liquid underlyings. Does anybody have any insight in how this actually all plays out?

Specifically, I'm looking at a couple ""hedged"" strategic-style ETFs with like 15k-20k volume -- HTUS and DYLS. Since I'd probably hold these through a crash/recession, seems like I could just wait until the premium/discount is neutral or in my favor. Is there any reason why the low volume on these would pose a significant liquidity risk? Would I ever be stuck sacrificing my PvR to the spread?";;Liquidity issues overblown with low-volume ETFs?;

[deleted];1517171383;7tmuwv;;0;;1;[deleted];;Stuck in my head;
BannerlordAdmirer;1517173920;7tn59t;;9;;9;"Stocktwits is correctly called a cesspool by a lot of people, but it's also an r/stocks meme that gets parroted a lot. There are tons of zero follower pumper shills, bad traders, trolls, 100-200 follower pumpers and bashers etc. But it only takes a couple of days before you start to screen out all the junk automatically. 

My brain shuts out the '*buyout coming', 'contracts in a week'*, and the repetitive pump posts now and it only takes less than a minute to open a new tab and see if another user is legit or not. 

There are also slightly more subtle P&amp;D tactics, a tricky one at first is the ""*INSIDER BOUGHT LAST MONTH! TO THE MOON*"" when they were code A acquisitions (a director was gifted x amount of stocks) and the insider didn't actually buy at open market, which is code P. You can always double check by going to fintel.com. If it's a code S (an insider sold), there will always be someone to fact check if it was a preplanned divestment or not. On the INTC board the Krzanich sale got argued/debated to dead horse territory with lots of slurs vs. here on reddit and the finance and tech sites it's a several weeks/couple months lag. 

So where is the real value? ST is ultimately a social platform but the real dialogue takes place off of it after you connect with someone. Two users following each other can dm each other and you can reach out and offer to exchange contact details (mostly discord), the worst that can happen when you reach out to someone is they just don't respond. Everyone is looking relentlessly for an edge, and finding likeminded people with the same goals is part of it. 

The most important thing about following ANYONE is that you still have to be your own trader/investor and *know when to exit on your own*.

A year ago I thought pretty cynically that these guys don't post exits a lot of the time. But now I look at it another way: thousands of $$ are at stake, they're managing 2-3 day trades or 5 or 6 swingtrades at a time and it can get hectic if two runners are going at the same time. 

In the 30 seconds it takes to sell a stock at an intraday's top or the swing's top and to jump back onto ST and post that they've sold, the stock can already tank. Then if you're not following the action and you don't have the sell order already there with the cursor on submit/confirm, or maybe you hesitate after seeing a post, it's already two minutes into the panic selloff/profit-taking. If there's a circuitbreaker or halt, you are going to be paying 100% attention to your own trades. There's not enough time for handholding. It's the market, everyone's priority is to protect their own capital and make money for themselves 1st and foremost. 

With that said, I wanted to share an informational, non-technical user that I follow: 

**https://stocktwits.com/HedgeMind** - insider and institutional buys, the main 'follow the money' update source I've found. They're more geared to hedge fund and institutions. I used to follow 
https://stocktwits.com/cctranscripts/ideas - conference call transcripts and news releases. This one also does insider buys and sells, but a lot of them are just small sells by the odd director which creates a lot of noise. It's not a buy reason alone but you can check the board and see if bigger names pop up, look at the chart, check finviz and see what the company has been doing the last couple months, start the DD process. 

The two other functions I use Stocktwits for are to pick up watchlist candidates and keep track of the overall market. I think most of the users you should follow should be the traders/speculators so you have a pipeline of stocks to rotate into after one batch runs. I also follow a few guys who are good readers of the SPY, the bear/volatility ETFs, US Dollar Index etc to keep track of the economic background and market sentiment/price action. For example, in the week of Jan 15th with the government shutdown and SPY double-topping, I only made two trades, took a 2-3% loss for each, just waited it out. I didn't hedge but there were guys that didn't want to liquidate their positions, so they correctly timed picking up UVXY and then ended up green on a week most traders/investors were down or flat.

FIinvestor;1517253768;7tus02;;0;;1;"If you buy ETF shares over time, how are year end capital gains and/ or dividend distributions taxed if you have held some but not all ETF shares &gt;1 year? Should both dividend and capital gains distributions be a weighted average of the % total you have held &gt; vs &lt; 1 year?

I also read that taxes on capital gains distributions for ETFs are delayed until you sell though I'd like to confirm if this is correct for distributions or if it only pertains to capitals gains/ losses from selling the etf itself.

For dividends, Are they taxed as short term for portions I held &lt;60 days prior to the dividend date?

rntksi;1517304980;7tzwp8;;7;;2;"Hello,

I've just made my first array into investing &amp; stocks trading.

Where I come from, the bank's rate for annual savings interest is at 6% (state bank) and 7.2% for private banks.

I started trading end of December with my savings and made a net 12.07% (after taxes+fees) gain &amp; promptly exited exactly 01 month after.

Is that good/bad? Looking at local ETFs I can see them promise a 18% rate (over 5 years) on a mix of 80% stocks / 20% govt bond.

People I talked to tell me I should have a rate of +10 points from bank rate as a scale of performance (i.e. they believe that making a 17% gain when bank is 7% is good). Is that sound advice? Should I have waited some more?

Also, what should be the general guidelines if I just want to save some money but put them into the market instead of a savings account? What rate should I expect to have following a 5-7 year period? Should I go into US/EU market or stay local? I have a modest 5 figures annual salary (in US$), which is above average in my country.

PM-MeYour-cock;1517316389;7u0rak;;1;;1;"The merger offer with Dominion has the shares worth about $55, currently selling at $43. A nice gain should the deal go through. Even if this particular deal doesn’t go through, this company imo is worth a lot more than the currently selling share price.

The other side of that, SC state lawmakers and regulators have been putting on quite a political show in threatening to take actions, that would drive the company into bankruptcy over the failed nuclear project. 

Bottom line: Some of South Carolina’s legislators are a bit dumb, like Shane Massey, calling the company’s potential for bankruptcy a bluff, even saying if it did happen it wouldn’t be that bad of a thing. However, in sum, I still yet refuse to believe the state has the balls to do something so horrifically retarded as driving their state regulated electric and gas utility into bankruptcy. So bottom line? Yes, there is a bankruptcy threat looming on the horizon, but if one were to say ok they cannot be that fully retarded, then we have a $55/share company selling at $43. 

My very advanced trading strategy is to buy a little bit and plug my ears and close my eyes and say LA LA LA LA LA LA! To all of the state regulator and lawmaker bankruptcy theatrics.

In my experience and observations, 3 scenarios commonly develop.

1. The shares that they purchase go down and they get discouraged and quit.

2. The shares go sideways and they get bored and quit. 

3. Perhaps the most dangerous scenario is when the stocks they choose perform very well and the children get overconfident and think they are smarter than people on Wall Street, the majority of which don't beat the market.

Awmos;1517430741;7uczum;;8;;2;"  Hey guys, I have a big position (relative to my portoflio) on Patriot One, for those who don't know about $PTOTF, they are making concealed bio-scanners which scan for concealed weapons to prevent mass shootings. They recently got a ton of exposure after the Las Vegas shooting, and for a panel they did in LV where the support was unanimously positive. Today, some news was announced that to me, at face value seemed very positive, but is slightly over my head so I was hoping the geniuses and trolls of /r/stocks could help me out.

So here is a summary of the news:

* PATRIOT ONE TECHNOLOGIES ( PTOTF ) - ‍ENTERED AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH UNDERWRITERS AGREED TO BUY, ON BOUGHT DEAL BASIS, 8.7 MILLION UNITS AT $2.00 PER UNIT.

Mind you, the company has a market cap of only 157M and the current price is $1.77 so this is a huge deal for the company.

Shortly after this was announced, The Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) put a halt on exchanging $PTOTF shares. 

It was subsequently resumed after they announced an ""Increase to the Previously Announced Bought Deal Financing"". It is stated that the original deal of 8.7M is now going to be worth 22M.

NOW. This is where it gets confusing as f*** for me.

""Each Unit will consist of one common share of the Company (a ""Common Share"") and one half of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole Common Share purchase warrant, a ""Warrant""). Each Warrant will be exercisable to acquire one Common Share (a ""Warrant Share"") for a period of 36 months following the closing of the Offering (the ""Closing"") at an exercise price of $2.40 per Warrant Share.""

So is this saying that they are also being given an call option of $2.40??? 
Okay, they are anticipating the share which is currently trading at $1.77 to go up to $2.40. That's good, right??

And then there is this:
The Company has agreed to grant the Underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1,650,000 Units at the Offering Price or up to 825,000 Warrants at a price of $0.30 per Warrant, exercisable in whole or in part, at any time on or prior to the date that is 30 days following the Closing.

So this means that if they want, they can buy an additional 825,000 call options for $.30 per option. Correct?

So all is fine and dandy in the world of PTOTF you would think. They just got a massive investment, they have a bunch of units on back order, their product is now saleable in 66 countries, and they've also said they have 13 huge contracts in the works, and a bunch of smaller ones.

Okay. So, why did PTOTF poop the bed and drop by 8% percent today? I actually doubled down on my position during the dip. But I'm getting a little worried here that there is something I'm missing in these announcements that has everyone else pulling out.
Could the price drop simple be due to the fact that the IIROC put a halt on exchanging PTOTF? 

Thank you all for your thoughts and efforts.

A_Patent_Lawyer;1517448547;7uf3rg;;2;;2;"Hey Reddit! Been checking out reddit for 4 years+ now--I guess it's time I finally post something! Hopefully I don't get reamed too hard and I am in the right spot...
&amp;nbsp; 
&amp;nbsp;



I'm hoping to get some guidance from you all regarding my portfolio.  I've really only started investing about 2 years ago and the purpose of this portfolio is just to buy and hold.  Every month I put about $1,000 into the account and and try and keep an evenISH balance across the portfolio.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  

  

  
**Anyway, here's my concern.**   
I know that I've been very lucky to come into the market when I have, but I'm concerned that (1) that my portfolio is not as diversified as it should be and (2) when the market drops, I'll feel it harder than I should.  I blame it on the market lulling me into believing that I actually know what I'm doing when really a monkey probably outperformed me this year.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  

  

   
So, without further ado, would you mind just taking a quick look at my current portfolio and letting me know your thoughts and concerns.  It would be greatly appreciated. Quick note that the a small handful of these holdings (the *italicized ones*) are from this week when I started realizing I'm way to tech heavy...

skateboarder3021;1517502741;7ujxm8;;31;;2;Ford has dipped the past week to a deep low of $10.80. I think this is a very big swing opportunity as it is a short time away (I'd guess a matter of hours, one more day maximum) from a huge rebound, in my opinion. I look at indicator trends and specifically the RSI is showing an extremely oversold state, meaning it is set for a huge rebound. If you know indicators, it is also at the bottom bollinger band and the MACD is set for a big crossover. If you are not familiar with data indicators, these are three of the most popular ones (from what I've researched) and all three are showing signs for a big bullish move. Do your DD and take a look at the charts for yourself. Just thought I'd share some info for those looking for a quick swing trade.;;$F HUGE Swing Trade Opportunity;

* As much as 30-40% of Euronet’s profits and EBITDA are generated solely by DCC revenues with ultra high margins.  The sell side has largely missed this entirely. 

* During 2017, scathing public criticism erupted from a wide array of journalists, travel advisers and celebrity TV hosts, directly alleging Euronet “fraud”, “rips offs” and “scams” with DCC Evidence posted in photos, screenshots and videos. 

* Multiple independent investigations then concluded specifically that “DCC should be banned”

* Following the public scrutiny, a wide range of Euronet insiders began aggressively dumping their shares (and just ahead of a key vote in November 2017 by the EU Parliament)

* Since then, EU legislation covering DCC has passed multiple key milestones.

* Final regulations are set to be passed by June 2018

* Euronet trades on a steep premium to peers because of perceived growth prospects. Any reassessment will see disproportionate downside to the share price ";;Short $EEFT – Euronet To Drop 50-60% On Latest DCC Developments;

# **WEEK AHEAD: Scary Friday could lead to scary Monday for markets** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/02/scary-friday-could-lead-to-scary-monday-for-markets.html)*

*****

&gt; Friday's dramatic sell-off capped the worst week in two years for stocks, and investors were looking forward to Monday with trepidation.
*****
&gt; The wild ride, which shaved 3.8 percent off the S&amp;P 500, is the first correction of more than 3 percent since just before the presidential election in 2016. Since the election, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 30 percent, and this week's selling reintroduces volatility that has been unheard of since then.
*****
&gt; ""How long has it has been since we've had a scary Friday, and a whole scary weekend until we see what Monday is like?"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. ""The other thing that got me, leading up to this week, is that good news stopped helping stocks.""
*****
&gt; The stock market sell-off was tied to a sell-off in bonds, and bond strategists were reluctant to call a direction for interest rates in the week ahead, after the unusual volatility of the past week.
*****
&gt; ""The sell-off has been pretty violent,"" said Michael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. ""Normally I'd say if you have some 40 basis point move in the 10-year, it's better looking for long-term investors.""
*****
&gt; But that may not be clear until trading opens up again in the Asian session early Monday, and really not until the markets move past the Treasurys $66 billion in auctions of 3-, 10-year and 30-year bonds, Tuesday through Thursday.
*****
&gt; This past week, the Treasury announced higher issuance at those auctions, and that also spooked bonds, which have been anticipating a surge in new debt this year.
*****
&gt; Jerome Powell is sworn in as Fed chair Monday, after Janet Yellen leaves the post over the weekend. There are a number of Fed speakers in the coming week, and they may have comments about inflation but the markets are mostly looking forward to the Fed forecasts after its March meeting and Powell's comments at his first press briefing after that meeting.
*****
&gt; Yields, which move opposite price, had also been rising on inflation expectations and the idea that the Fed and other central banks could raise interest rates and tighten policy. But then the January employment report Friday included the best wage gains since 2009. That sent rates spiking, and the 10-year jumped to 2.85 percent, its highest level since January 2014.
*****
&gt; ""The market obviously got a little ahead of itself and all it took was the sell-off in bonds to show us that. Meanwhile, earnings are fine,"" said Bob Doll, chief U.S. equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. ""Tell me where the 10-year yield is going to end up in this noisy period. If it stops going up, stocks will probably stop going down.""
*****
&gt; Strategists said the market is adjusting to the idea that the Fed could have to raise interest rates more than the three times it forecast for this year.
*****
&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief U.S. equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said ifthe 10-year gets close to 3 percent that could be problematic for stocks. ""If yields stop here, this correction is likely going to be one of a combination of price and time correction ... sideways choppy, volatile for a number of weeks but not material downside. But if politics stay in the headlines and rates continue to rise, that's how you get the big move to the downside.""
*****
&gt; Washington will continue to be a focus as Congress faces a Feb. 8 budget deadline and markets watch for fallout from the House intelligence committee release of a GOP memo on the Russian investigation.

# A Big January Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; An old adage on Wall Street suggests, “So goes January, goes the year.” With stocks seeing one of the best January returns ever, it is time to take a closer look at the January barometer. The January barometer was first discussed by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac in 1972. Simply put, if the first month of the year is green, it bodes well for the rest of the year and vice versa if we see a red January.

&gt; Looking at the numbers confirms that when the S&amp;P 500 Index is green in January the rest of the year (final 11 months) is up 12.2% on average, well above the average return of 7.9% over the final 11 months of the year; but when that first month is red the final 11 months are up only 1.2% on average. According to Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist, “The January barometer isn’t perfect, but it does have a pretty solid track record. Now where things really get interesting is when that first month is up more than 5% (like 2018 is on track to be), the return over the final 11 months actually gets stronger.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/the-january-barometer-has-bulls-smiling.png?w=522&amp;h=213))**

*****

&gt; Of course we don’t suggest simply investing based on what the first month does, but with the overall global economic backdrop and corporate earnings growth as strong as it appears to be, this is yet another sign that 2018 may see a continuation of the bull market.

&gt; In all the instances when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 5% at the end of January, the full year return has never been negative (higher 12 out of 12 times); but it is worth noting that they weren’t smooth rides. The average peak-to-trough correction was 10.7%, while the smallest intra-year pullback was -4.4%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/january-momentum-can-lead-to-continued-gains.png?w=522&amp;h=436))**

&gt; As we noted in our recent Weekly Market Commentary, we are on the lookout for added volatility in 2018 as the economic cycle ages, but we would use any pullbacks to add to portfolio positions. This study is another example as to why we expect the bull to continue, but to be ready for a potentially bumpy ride.

# Why Midterm Years Can Slip Up Bull Markets

&gt; Equities were met with tremendous success during the first year of President Trump’s term, but now we’re headed into the much more historically troublesome midterm year. As Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist notes, “Midterm years tend to be a banana peel for markets, as they see the largest pullbacks out of the four-year presidential cycle. However, those who hang on for the ride tend to see a significant bounce over the next year.”

&gt; Taking a closer look, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been down 16.9% on average at its intra-year low during midterm years, though it tends to bounce back, posting an impressive 32.0% average gain over the subsequent twelve months.

*****

&gt; Now take a look at all of the midterm years and how the S&amp;P 500 performed after the intra-year lows were made:

&gt; The action over the past year has been historic on many levels, but we have our concerns as the bull market continues to move higher. In our next Weekly Market Commentary, due out later today, we will list some of the amazing streaks which make the recent market action truly special, but we will also look at a few other potential near-term worries which could trigger some long overdue volatility.

Albemarle (105.51, -3.38%), a chemical manufacturing giant, has benefited in recent years from the hype surrounding electric vehicles. It has fallen dramatically from its Nov high of 149.99 due to fears of increased competition in the lithium market.

Itau Unibanco Holdings (ITUB) is scheduled to release earnings on February 6, 2018, and will hold a conference call at 8:00 AM ET on the same day. The stock currently trades at 15.40, which is 6.1% lower than the close following its last reported earnings, trading with a range of 15.38 to 16.74 since that time.
Expected Price Volatility
Currently, option traders are expecting a ± 5.3% move for this earnings, and during the previous earnings release, the stock experienced a +0.3% move. Over the last 12 quarters, the absolute average move has been ± 2.9%, with a minimum move of 0.3% and a maximum move of 6.8%. ITUB hasn't experienced any larger-than-expected earnings moves in the last 12 quarters.
Earnings Price Pattern
The MarketChameleon earnings price pattern has detected two notable historical trends.
1 Day After Earnings:For each of the last 5 quarters, ITUB stock price has gone up on the day following earnings. It has had an average gain of +1.9% during that span.
1 Week Before Earnings:For 9 of the last 12 quarters (75%), the stock price has gone up in the week before earnings. Over that period, it has an average gain of +0.9%.
Earnings Option Strategies
MarketChameleon's option strategy analysis shows that buying at-the-money calls the day before earnings had 71% winning occurrences, for an average gain of +8.7%. Additionally, buying at-the-money straddles only resulted in 43% winning occurrences -- however, the average return was a gain of +0.5%.
EPS Estimate
Analysts are currently expecting ITUB to report an earnings of $0.29 per share, compared to $0.29 for the same quarter last year. Revenue is expected to come in at $8.5 billion versus $8.8 billion for the previous year.";;With $ITUB Earnings MarketChameleon earnings price pattern has detected two notable historical trends.;

Because based on trendlines, if you look at stocks like BAC JPM and WFC you will notice that their low of day today hit almost exactly the trendline that links their latest dips in the past 365 days.

* U.S. Dow futures this morning were indicating another nosedive at the open that breach the correction level, defined as a decline of 10 percent over time from recent new highs. Monday was the worst day for the Dow and S&amp;P 500 since August 2011 as well as the biggest single-day point drop for the Dow in history. Futures have been volatile all night and have been positive at various junctures. (CNBC)
* Why the stock market plunged Monday (CNBC)

* Cramer: Stop yourself from panicking and find the sell-off's opportunities (CNBC)
* The yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note and on the 30-year Treasury bond were lower today as investors continued to keep abreast of the volatile trading seen across international and domestic markets. Bond yields move inversely to prices. (CNBC)
* The Cboe Volatility index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, was higher this morning after doubling during regular market hours Monday. The key market measure jumped above 50, its highest level since August 2015. (CNBC)
* Obscure security linked to stock volatility plummets 80% after hours, sparking worries of bigger market effect (CNBC)
* European stocks reduced some of their earlier losses after tumbling 3 percent in the early hours of today's session amid inflation growth expectations. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 1.7 percent lower with every sector in the red. (CNBC)
* Economic numbers will get no attention today, but there are a few on the schedule beginning with the December trade deficit at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Labor Department releases its December JOLTS report at 10 a.m., its measure of job opportunities and labor turnover. (CNBC)

* Over $550 billion wiped off cryptocurrencies since record high (CNBC)
* House GOP lawmakers are proposing a long-term boost to military funding in a short-term spending bill slated for a vote this week. The move is likely to cause tension with some Democrats and complicate plans to keep the government open. (Washington Post)

* 'Treasonous': Trump goes after Dems who didn't clap during State of the Union (CNBC)

Credit Suisse said it will end trading in a security that traders said was exaggerating movements in volatility futures markets and even the overall stock market.

The last day of trading for VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term exchange-traded note (XIV) will be Feb. 20, according to an announcement from Credit Suisse. It is triggering this liquidation because the product could not keep up with the scenario it was supposed to track: a calm market.

The XIV security, which had fallen roughly 85 percent in after-hours trade, had been halted pending this news early Tuesday. The security is supposed to give the opposite return of the Cboe Volatility index (VIX), the market's widely followed turbulence gauge.

Multiple exchange-traded securities that are also supposed to be bets on calm markets were also halted Tuesday morning after losing the majority of their value overnight.

VRgamer84;1517948631;7vqa51;;16;;0;"Invested $5300 a month ago, today I used $5300 on margin and went all in for total amount invested $10,600. Last night I made a post saying I was going to sell it all because the futures being down a grand scared me.

But I slept on it and came to the conclusion that all my investing years I have always played it too conservative and played not to lose instead of playing to win and always sold at the hint of trouble, I realized I never made money doing this and simply went the opposite route and bought more! 

So I pulled a 180, slid all my chips to the center of the table and used my full margin to buy in today and did some dollar cost averaging on stocks I bought a month ago.

Dont worry, I bought solid, blue chip companies, some with good dividends to offset the margin interest . My portfolio now consists of NFLX, AMZN, GOOGL, FB, PYPL, NVDA, MSFT, INTC and AAPL. All tech baby!

I told myself that I am doing this for the long term (5-10 years) and I will not sell a single share, so either A. I'm going to profit or B. I will get margin called because that's the only way I'm selling.";;Welp, went all in on the dip, maxed out margin today. Its either profit or margin call!;

All of it vested a week ago. Using today's stock price of $105, I have about 6k worth of stock (RSU's), 8k worth of options at a $45 grant price, 8k worth of options at a $55 grant price, and 8k worth of options at a $75 grant price.

Importantly, I have no short term need for the money (with the sole exception of 120k in student loans at 3% interest). Do I really want to be holding so much equity in one company, even if it is a great company? I would think it would be better to spread the money around into different assets. Also, if I sell, not sure what the right approach is to go about it, do I sell the more profitable options first?

For some added context, I had 1500 RSU's for TI stock that vested (after 6 long years!) last summer. Sold ALL of it at a share price of $90 (made about 90k after taxes) as soon as it vested because I had an urgent need for the money. Needed it for a downpayment on a house we loved. Made a few offers on houses and none of them worked out. Was not fun watching the stock price climb to $120, knowing that I sold 1500 shares at $90 so recently. Looking back, I wish I could have done it in bunches (10k at a time? based on how the market/stock was looking).

Don't want to make any big mistakes this time, its so much money, and hoping to be smart about how I manage it. I'm pretty clueless about this stuff and would appreciate any insight you all can offer! ";;What to do with 30k worth of recently vested stock/options in Texas Instruments?;

When live trading, moments like these tend to be the easiest to pick up profits as investors panic... you can tell that investors are  committed to a security and I think that commitment creates this emotional response to changes in the stock's price.

When you're just in and out after a reasonable profit, you simply don't become emotionally invested in any position. It's strictly a trade. Psychology is probably the biggest key factor in live trading and it's clear in these situations. Also, if you're monitoring markets everyday, you might as well get rid of any long term vision for a particular company and go with momentum. Every day you have a clean slate and overall, you'll see better returns.

So my grandfather passed away a few years ago and it's taken a while to process his estate but it's finally being done and I'm having some problems!

He mentioned at one point while he was alive that he had investments in a telephone company he worked at but we have been unable to find these investments. He was very frugal so it's unlikely he spent them but it's possible! Is there anyway to locate these investments? We have already tried our states(NJ) unclaimed funds.

Also I found a few stocks he put directly in my name as a child totally roughly 3k in a ""credit balance"" and 6k invested in various stocks! I was able to get a form that allowed me to ""re-register"" or ""liquidate"" I chose re-register and received a check for 9k in the mail, so it seems they liquidated them which isn't what I asked for. I have pictures of the forms just before I sent them! 

I'm a college student in a non-business field so I have barely any idea where to start! Maybe you guys could point me in the right direction before I speak to the claims investigator!

TD and Fidelity's dashboards are so ""busy"" that it's hard to find what I'm looking for, and even more annoying is that it seems like half of each webpage is covered in ads or re-direct links Im not interested in. And they don't have interactive charts like the old google finance used to. Nothing is customizable, and they don't have a section for stock symbols I'm interested in or frequently view for quick info, like the old google finance used to. They have watch lists, but they gear those more towards trading and the column headers aren't customizable.. All of this in addition to no easy way to find similar stocks in the same sector, unless you already know the symbol. 

Ally invest is much more user friendly and more customizable, but their watch list lacks some info tickers i want (dividend yield, ex date) and they're charts lack event/new symbols. They have almost no research tools and their stock info page doesn't even have the paragraph that explains what that company is.

MU-Micron Technology.  Very bullish and down about 17% from their year high.  Makes RAM that is in high demand and has some very good positions with cloud computing companies.

IVV- Looking to buy an S&amp;P 500 Index ETF on the dip, and after this week I dont think there will be a better chance in the near future. 

ROK and ROBO.  Obviously 2 very different stocks but in the same massively expanding industry of automation and robotics. ROBO is obviously the safer bet as an ETF, but ROK is an industry leader and currently half way between its year high/low and is very bullish.  Thinking get both with ROBO as a long term hold, and ROK as an intermediate hold as the industry expands.  

OSK-Oshkosh.  Again, bullish and mid way between their year high/lows. Just got the contract to provide the Army with 7 year contract to refurbish FMTVs with the Army on top of their contract to provide the new JMTVs.  

BAC- Bank of America.  Bought during the banking crisis at $7 and am looking to increase what I own.  With interest rates going up, I see this one continuing to grow.  

Again curious what the internets think.  Iv been saving some money for a while now waiting for this correction.  Some like ROBO and BAC Im already pretty convinced to buy, but am curious as to what more informed minds may think.  ";;Looking to buy on the dip. Thoughts on my choices?;
ishkabum;1518151343;7wb2hi;;0;;3;"A couple weeks ago I found this when I was looking for US renewable energy stocks. Their main product is something called the Power Buoy which can generate energy and do other things, and they produce these custom built. 

Based on the news I've seen since I started watching them, I think it has way more upside than a a lot of other things I'm looking at. They have 3 great things for mid term forecast. Two weeks ago when these things were being announced, they started to run a bit and now with this crash I'm glad they came back down because I didn't really load up.

 1. New facility on east coast, closer to their partners. They couldn't tell me on investor relations line about cost impact but they implied the best they could that this will help their bottom line and that's why the move, I mean obviously. They have been negative EPS generally which is why they're so low. If they start turning a profit you will see upward moves.

 2. Mitsui Shipbuilding a $1.4 B company from Japan just visited their office to commemorate the completion of a project and to talk about future partnership. Can expect a press release in coming months if and when that finalizes.

 3. They just announced Jan 20th that they're starting a 3 month feasibility study on using their PowerBuoy in the North Sea. When that finishes, and it's a custom build they're doing for this to integrate with their systems and provide multiple things... then they would go into talks about production.

Encouragedissent;1518153641;7wb9y8;;3;;1;"First I should start by saying im trying to save up to pay off my mortgage and I actually am about 3/4 there. If I have to wait however it isnt the end of the world for me.

My strategy has been to constantly be ready for a correction or even recession with cash, and to keep volatility down. 40% of my assets are cash, 1 month ago when the dow broke 26000 I sold some of my stocks and put 20% of my assets in bonds. I halved my holdings of BA, BOA, and sold a small portion of MS, and COST. VZ I got rid of completely which I had been planning to do. After this I bought Some ETF's and Bonds.

So I am now holding only 25% stocks, 20% ETF's, 20% bonds and the rest of my money is in cash. As you can imagine I have less volatility than regular market movement, with my cash being held in my checking account I saw a 2% loss in my investment account today. My cash can be moved instantly and for free because I use BOA and Merrell Edge. I also get free trades because of this setup. 

Yesterday I started my buying. I have a list of 30 day expiring limit orders of various companies and the value I would like to buy them at. This amounts to about 15% of my cash. About 5% of my cash I already increased my stock holdings with.

My question is, I feel like i timed the market and got lucky, however my ETF's have all dropped to some degree, but none over 10% yet. How aggressive should I be buying right now in your option. I feel like if this continues every 5% down I should invest another 5% of my cash. until I am down to only an emergency fund. Is this too aggressive?

I feel like the fundamentals are still good and we are only seeing a correction here, so Im feeling greedy as though every day we have such as today I should counter with buying more. I could see the dow dropping to 20k but I just dont believe without a major catalyst we will see a full 40-60% crash. ";;Is my strategy unsound? I would appreciate some critique.;

All other Canadian airlines combined don’t even have 100. These two positions will essentially give me exposure to the entire Canadian Airline industry.

AC has a p/e of around 3, but forecasted to increase to a more reasonable 8. WJA is at a 9 forcasted to remain about the same. Industry average is around 4 but that’s inflated with AC having the majority of the market cap, and a clearly lower than it should be P/E.

AC has a p/b ratio of 2 which is approximately the industry average, while WJA is at a p/b of 1.2.

Fundamentally, ignoring industry averages, WestJet has a great P/E and a great P/B. Furthermore, the industry averages are currently skewed by ACs great performance, and will be much closer to WestJet going forward.

# **WEEK AHEAD: Stocks and bonds can both go down in volatile trading following wildest week in two years** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/09/stocks-and-bonds-can-both-go-down-in-volatile-trading-following-wildest-week-in-two-years.html)*

*****

&gt; Friday's dramatic sell-off capped the worst week in two years for stocks, and investors were looking forward to Monday with trepidation.
*****
&gt; The wild ride, which shaved 3.8 percent off the S&amp;P 500, is the first correction of more than 3 percent since just before the presidential election in 2016. Since the election, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 30 percent, and this week's selling reintroduces volatility that has been unheard of since then.
*****
&gt; Stocks come off a punishingly volatile week ready for more selling as the market continues to search for a floor and stock investors keep an eye on rising interest rates.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 5.2 percent to 2,619, its worst week of trading since January 2016. The Dow, also off 5.2 percent, and the S&amp;P both saw their first 10 percent correction since early 2016.
*****
&gt; Culprits behind the selling were an ugly shakeout in funds that bet against market volatility and the building pressure of higher interest rates on stocks.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields for the 10-year note and 30-year bond were slightly higher on the week, but the 2-year was lower at 2.05 percent. Rising yields pressured stocks, but when stocks sold off, investors turned to the Treasury market as a safe haven. That in turn sent rates back down, since yields move opposite price. The 10-year was at 2.85 percent Friday, below its 2.88 percent high for the week.
*****
&gt; Despite extremely wide swings and days with 1,000-point Dow losses, stock strategists are mostly looking for the market to bottom soon and expect stocks will ultimately adjust to rising interest rates. But that process could be rocky, with many bond strategists now seeing the 10-year yield at 3 percent or above, much sooner than expected.
*****
&gt; Bank of America Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett, who has long been looking for a correction, said he expects that a good buying level would be at about 2,500 on the S&amp;P 500 and 3 percent on the 10-year yield.
*****
&gt; ""My gut here is 2,500 and 3 percent on the 10-year. They are big, big levels. You expect the market to find a reason to buy at that particular moment,"" he said.
*****
&gt; The markets in the week ahead will focus on their own action, particularly the tensions between stocks and bonds, but there are a few key data points that could impact trading. The CPI, consumer price index, is released Wednesday and it is an important inflation reading that investors are watching for any surprise pickup in inflation. That is released Wednesday morning, as are January retail sales.
*****
&gt; ""The next big event we know that's on the calendar is CPI, and that could impact the Fed. The next big date for the bond market after that, assuming stocks calm down, which is a shaky assumption, is the 28th, when [Fed chair Jerome] Powell testifies,"" said Michael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.
*****
&gt; Powell started as Fed chair this past week, and markets have been anxious to hear his views on market volatility. Powell testifies before Congress Feb. 28, and the Fed is expected to raise rates at its next meeting in March. But market pros are watching the volatility, and there's a view the Fed holds off on that hike if the turbulence persists.
*****
&gt; Bond yields have been rising as global central banks, including the Fed, step back from easy policies and raise rates. Treasury yields have also been rising as investors eye the steep increase in U.S. Treasury issuance, expected to rise to $1.25 trillion this year. Another big catalyst for the market is the improvement in global growth and the potential for inflation to rise as a result.
*****
&gt; Now the stock and bond markets are so closely correlated, the action in one feeds off the other. Stocks will be a big factor for bonds in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Gluskin Sheff and Associates' David Rosenberg said, in a note Friday, that the fact both stocks and bonds are selling off at the same time is unusual, and it is similar to time periods with significant market turmoil. He noted that the 10-year yield was rising as the S&amp;P fell sharply Thursday, down more than 10 percent from its January record high.
*****
&gt; ""I cannot tell you how rare a market condition this is — that yields are rising into this risk pullback,"" he wrote in a note to clients Friday. Rosenberg cited how bonds rallied during the financial crisis in 2008 when the market fell and during other big corrections. Other times were 1987 and 1994.
*****
&gt; As for currency markets, the U.S. dollar had a powerful week, with the dollar index rising 1.3 percent, its best week since October. As the dollar rose, oil fell, with West Texas Intermediate losing 9.9 percent for the week to just above $59.20 per barrel, its worst week in two years.
*****
&gt; Hartnett expects a rising dollar and other de-risking moves will be necessary before the shakeout in stocks ends.
*****
&gt; ""Maybe we need to see the dollar move up, and that's the thing that causes investors to do things they least like to do: sell winners — tech, high yield, emerging markets. In these corrections, you sell hubris and buy humiliation. One measure of humiliation is everything goes through the wringer. Nothing is left unscathed,"" he said. ""The dollar rally would be the ultimate risk off. That's part and parcel of the story.""
*****
&gt; Earnings in the week ahead include consumer companies, such as Pepsi on Tuesday and Coca-Cola and Campbell Soup on Friday. Some energy names also report, such as Diamond Offshore on Monday and Occidental Petroleum on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; JP Morgan strategists, in a late Friday note, said they believe that commodity trading advisors and risk parity hedge funds were at the core of the correction, but they believe that most of the unwind by those investors is over.
*****
&gt; ""This, combined with the low equity exposures of Discretionary Macro and Equity Long/Short hedge funds, leaves retail investors as the main residual risk for equity markets going forward,"" they wrote in a note.
*****
&gt; Unlike in other corrections, many strategists said they did not see a fundamental reason behind the selling, and the market became hostage to big round technical numbers that seemed to drive trading. After breaking the 50- and 100-day moving averages, the S&amp;P 500 bounced off the closely watched 200-day moving average Friday, at 2,538, and rebounded to close 1.5 percent higher.
*****
&gt; ""There's a little bit of ... technical activity around what is happening with volatility and how hedge funds have to readjust their strategies, given where volatility is,"" said Patrick Palfrey, equities strategist with Credit Suisse. ""Going forward, we're not really seeing a point where the economic cycle is coming to an end and with the earnings backdrop as strong as it is, volatility should come back in over the next couple of weeks, as people start to look more closely at those underlying factors.""
*****
&gt; Hartnett said there were plenty of warnings the correction was coming.
*****
&gt; ""Certainly, the first tremors were the very rate-sensitive areas of the equity markets — utilities, the REITs, the homebuilders which ... reminded people of the famous phrase 'fear of missing out.' Whether it was FOMO, or BTD, 'buy the dip,' or TNA, 'there is no alternative,' all these acronyms come back in vogue, and that's always going to be a dangerous moment,"" said Hartnett.

# STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: S&amp;P 500 Resets Correction Clock with 10.2% Decline

&gt; In just 13 calendar days, from its January 26 closing high through yesterday’s close, S&amp;P 500 declined 10.2%—an official correction. Should yesterday’s closing low hold, it will be the quickest correction by S&amp;P 500 going back to 1949. The second quickest correction was 18 calendar days in autumn 1955 when S&amp;P 500 shed 10.6%.

&gt; Using a 20% peak to trough decline to define a bear market, the current bull market is 3259 calendar days old today, nearly twice as long as average since 1949. The current bull is also the second longest, surpassed by only the great bull market that closed out the last millennium. The current correction is the fourth of the current bull market which is comparable to the numbers recorded by previous bull markets of similar duration.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://78.media.tumblr.com/d5e84b6916e409fe6d7cd858028098cd/tumblr_inline_p3w8yza9Hw1spdppr_1280.jpg))**

&gt; The path to recovery from this correction could be slow, but it is only February 9 and over ten and a half moths remain in 2018. Plenty of time remains for the market to finish the year with a gain. The positive implications of past big Januarys and a positive January Trifecta could still be realized.

&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 does not have a good record when it comes to forecasting the next recession. Since June 15, 1948 there have been 11 S&amp;P 500 bear markets and 24 corrections including the current one. Since the future is unknown, we will exclude the current correction meaning there have been 34 declines in excess of 10%. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research has only identified 11 recessions over the same time period. This works out to approximately 1 recession out of 3 S&amp;P 500 declines in excess of 10%.

*****

# S&amp;P 500 Corrections

&gt; After nearly two years without one, the S&amp;P 500 officially entered correction territory yesterday, falling 10.2% from its 1/26/18 all-time closing high. The current correction represents the 96th decline of 10%+ from a closing high that followed a gain of at least 10%. The chart below shows the magnitude of every prior correction for the S&amp;P 500 since 1928. Not including the current period, the median decline for the S&amp;P 500 in the 95 prior corrections was a decline of 16.4% over the course of 64 days. Keep in mind, though, that these are median levels. There have been a number of corrections (13) that saw declines of less than 11%, while several saw deeper declines of more than 20%. In terms of length, prior corrections have also been all over the map. Some have lasted as little as three days, while others have stretched on for well over a year.

&gt; Unfortunately, there is no hard and fast rule when it comes to corrections, and that’s what can make them so terrifying when you go through one. You never know when it will end. Throughout history, market corrections have ‘typically’ occurred a little more than once per year. As mentioned above, there have been 96 corrections since 1928, but if you look at their distribution over time, a good deal of them were clustered around the Great Depression. If we look just at the post-WWII period, there have been 55 corrections in the span of 73 years, reducing their frequency to once about every 16-17 months. In any event, the market was still overdue for a correction heading into the current one, but maybe not by as much as it seemed on the surface.

That may seem like a pretty wide discrepancy, but it’s actually pretty common for the individual stock reading to be much lower than the index itself due to the fact that not all stocks hit 52-week highs at the same time as the index. In fact, you rarely even see a third of stocks hit an all-time high on the same day.

&gt; While the ‘average’ stock is down 14.3%, the vast majority of stocks are down less than the average – 328 to be exact. Of those 328 names, 170 are still down less than 10% from their respective highs. So who is currently the biggest loser in the S&amp;P 500? That title belongs to Range Resources (RRC). At a current price of $13.16, RRC is down over 60% from its 52-week high. Behind RRC, there are three other stocks down over 50%. They are Chesapeake (CHK), General Electric (GE), and Envision Healthcare (EVHC). The demise of GE has certainly been a major fall from grace. While the stock didn’t perform well under the leadership of Jeff Immelt, it hasn’t been any better since he left. In fact, since Immelt officially retired on October 2nd, 2017, GE shares are down more than 40%!

&gt; On the upside, shares of Scripps Networks (SNI) have been holding up better than any S&amp;P 500 stock as they are down less than 2% from their 52-week highs.

stockenthusiast;1518281875;7wmkul;;3;;8;"Stock got halted before the close, the day before it was to be delisted. It didn't open back up for several days, volume was significant, all the scanners picked it up so it was the biggest mover of the day. My guess is either someone had a lot of naked shorts they needed to cover before they removed it from the Nasdaq, or somebody had a deal with someone to cover their shorts to drive up the price so insiders could dump whatever shares they had left. Honestly I don't completely know, those were just guesses. Very unusual that it would trade that much on such negative news, then get halted for several days. Also, and this is just my opinion, but I think this company was a front for some intelligence operation. You have General Michael Hayden, a retired four-star general who served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (2006-2009) and the National Security Agency (1999-2005), and Michael Chertoff, former director of Homeland Security, and co-author of the Patriot Act, on the advisory board. The company then goes under, gets dished off to a private company that's connected to the Trump administration. I feel bad for the shareholders that ended up holding the bag. Seems like this is the tip of an iceburg bigger than me, but it was interesting digging into this thing. Company also had 200 employees

* Mom has a neurological pain condition, will not be able to work much longer and provides 80% of our family income. (~$150K total income between the entire family.)
* Mom is letting me use her ~$23k 401k to actively invest.

I am trying to find out what my best path would be.
I am open to learning as much as I can, and dedicate the majority of my day (I work afternoons, will be up with the market) for trading.

I guess my question is, with $23k, what should I do?  I want to be actively involved, so chart pattern day trading seemed to be where I was leaning.  What resources can teach me?

I am fairly new to all this, but am willing to dedicate many hours a day to it.  I am a quick learner, and can notice patterns and changes well.

I don't know if I explained this horribly well or not, so if you have a question I will answer as soon as possible!

Thanks!

*Edit: The 23k is expendable, we have money saved for living expenses for a few years, and I have the time to dedicate to learning this, while still working and covering my own expenses.

silentcold;1518309942;7wpk09;;0;;2;"This is for the CSE (Canadian Securities Exchange) regarding reverse take over by a private company. 

 If I buy into a CSE ticker right now that will be going through a reverse take over by a private company via etrade. 

 Will the shares that I buy and own remain the same through the reverse take over process?

 Will the share structure remain the same? 

 Just curious so I can make a more educated decision before making share purchases on a CSE public company that will go through the reverse take over process in a month, two or three. ";;Reverse Takeover Share Structure? (CSE);

web_elf;1518352414;7wsjny;Advice;21;;0;"To start off I am a college student, up until a few years ago I was an analyst for a healthcare company (one of the big ones), but got let go due to personal legal troubles and lost my career. 

I recently took up investing, mainly because I blew through all my savings dealing with my legal issue (5 years ago). I have now stabilized my situation, and am managing the books for our family business revenue 700K&gt;1M a year. My parents you could say have money. They do not help me in anyway I just want to put the situation into context. 

To the point, I recently started investing with RH (switched from another broker) with about $200 in November, I now have *$861 (17.13% gains , loses the past 7 days have been -2.29%, so I am beating the market).

I don't want to be a YOLO investor/trader ( r/wallstreetbets/ - wink). I feel like perhaps I have gone overboard though. I started by just reading websites about stock news. Somehow what started as casual reading became more and more obsessive. I feel that there is just too much information. Stocks -&gt; Inverse ETFs -&gt; ETFs -&gt; ETNs -&gt; Mutual Funds -&gt; Bonds -&gt; REITS -&gt; Technical Analysis, Fundamentals, mathematical equations -&gt; news -&gt; RUMORS ... I feel like I need to know every detail, and I am not sure if it is 100% necessary! 

Is this normal? I literally am downloading textbooks. I downloaded like 3 economy textbooks, and one on corporate finance. Will reading these make me a better investor, or am I simply losing my mind, and wasting time? 

tl;dr -&gt; I spend about 14hr a day (night) researching... Am I losing my goddamn mind?
Im a physics major, not an economy major... anyway I just wanted to feel for opinions and feedback.

dabears_24;1518450670;7x1mee;Discussion;2;;3;"Nova Measuring Instruments is an Israel-based company that produces equipment to monitor/measure steps in semiconductor production (i.e. metrology). This is a required step of the semiconductor manufacturing process, so their products are essentially linked to the semiconductor market even though they don't directly design/manufacture semiconductors.

Basic info:
Price: $25.21 
Avg volume: 250k
52 high: $31.88
52 low: $15.30

Based on what I learned from their last earnings call, their biggest customers are China (they identified this market generically) and Samsung. They are currently in the end stages of development for some X-ray based monitoring technology (I don't fully understand this tech, you can read about it in the earnings transcript I linked).

Link to Q3 earnings transcript: http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/call-transcript.aspx?StoryId=4119077&amp;Title=nova-measuring-instruments-nvmi-ceo-eitan-oppenhaim-on-q3-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript

Based purely on chart observation, the stock seems to be facing resistance around $26. I found the company's fundamentals to be solid and the technology to have high upside/demand, but being a relative beginner, I can't really understand what keeps holding this stock back. I know it's not a simple answer, but there doesn't seem to be any negative news about the company, yet it gets left out of the runs of many of its semiconductor industry peers.

Last 3 quarters eps reports have had a surprise % of: 16.2 (Q3), 30 (Q2), 26.3 (Q1). The latest report was accompanied by ~20% drop in one day, presumably because of falling short of guidance. This is a small cap stock, so short term movement is very volatile. 63% of shares are held by institutions, so it has not yet been dominated by institutions but is on its way.

So that was my first attempt at a stock write up. Hoping to get people's thoughts on NVMI based on what you already know OR may learn after looking at the stock. I'd also love any feedback about the write up since I've never really discussed a stock this way.

Barnes &amp; Noble is laying off lead cashiers and digital leads, CNBC has learned.
Workers showed up Monday morning at various Barnes &amp; Noble locations to be notified that they no longer had a job.
A company spokesperson told CNBC: ""Given our sales decline this holiday, we're adjusting staffing.""
Barnes &amp; Noble BKS is trimming its staff, laying off lead cashiers, digital leads and other experienced workers in a company-wide clearing, CNBC has learned from sources familiar with the matter.

The news came abruptly for many workers who showed up Monday morning at various Barnes &amp; Noble locations to be notified that they no longer had a job, the people said. The number of affected workers couldn't immediately be determined. As of April 29 of last year, Barnes &amp; Noble employed about 26,000 people.

""[Barnes &amp; Noble] has been reviewing all aspects of the business, including our labor model,"" a spokeswoman told CNBC about the layoffs. ""Given our sales decline this holiday, we're adjusting staffing so that it meets the needs of our existing business and our customers. As the business improves, we'll adjust accordingly.""

Although consumer spending was generally strong this holiday season, not all retailers reaped the rewards. At Barnes &amp; Noble, 2017 holiday sales fell more than 6 percent to $953 million, compared with the year prior. Same-store sales fell 6.4 percent for the holiday period, while online sales dropped 4.5 percent.

The New York-headquartered retailer has increasingly faced pressure from the likes of Walmart WMT and e-commerce behemoth Amazon AMZN , which have managed to steal a larger share of the books market. Walmart is planning to make a massive push in selling e-books and e-readers on Walmart.com later this year. Meanwhile, Amazon is opening up more of its own bricks-and-mortar bookstores.

Barnes &amp; Noble is still under pressure to make a move before it's too late to save the company. Last July , activist investor Sandell Asset Management urged Barnes &amp; Noble to sell itself, saying the retailer could fetch at least $12 per share and attract media or internet companies seeking a retail presence. Sandell called the company's real estate ""beachfront property"" at the time.

Then, having not reached an agreement with Barnes &amp; Noble by November , Sandell proposed to take Barnes &amp; Noble private in a deal that valued the company at more than $650 million, or over $9 per share. The books retailer barked back and called any such deal ""highly unlikely.""

Earlier Monday morning, Timothy Mantel was named Barnes &amp; Noble's chief merchandising officer, effective immediately, having previously held roles at GNC and Target. Mary Amicucci left the chief merchandising role at Barnes &amp; Noble last September.

Barnes &amp; Noble shares closed down more than 3 percent Monday at $4.70 apiece. The stock has fallen more than 55 percent from a year ago.";;"Barnes &amp; Noble cuts staff after dismal holiday season";

1. When you are doing great, it is the time to remember inflation.
2. During high inflation, earnings are not the dominant variable for investors.
3. Understand the math of the 'Misery Index.'
4. Inflation is a 'tapeworm' that makes bad businesses even worse for shareholders.
5. Focus on companies that generate rather than consume cash.
6. Look for companies that can increase prices and handle a lot more business without having to spend a lot.
7. Always be thinking about tomorrow, especially when the pace of change picks up.
8. Corporations cannot out-manage government.
9. There is no solution to inflation, but there's reason (maybe just a little) for hope.

However, Fitbit seems to be focusing on their software, and their user network.  They just aquired Twine which is a network of users with chronic conditions.  They have, to my knowledge, the largest health user database out of any of these companies. 

So, everyone knows they will probably lose to Apple or Garmin when it comes to the watch itself, but is there a way, if they stay hyper focused on data, and data acquisitions, that they can possess something that no other company can rival?  Fitbit has all the experience here.  That's gotta be worth something right?

Lerk409;1518710975;7xrco4;;2;;7;"Revenue growth met expectations but margins were lower than analysts expected.    They also announced the acquisition of the Dallas Infomart for $800m.  On the conference call the company said they expect margins to stay around 48% through 2018.  Seems like the street was expecting a return to the 50%+ target.  Combine that with the sudden departure of the CEO and there’s quite the selloff this morning.  

I continue to believe in EQIX as the strongest of the data center REITs due to their scale, one instance of that is illustrated by this quote from the conference call:

&gt; ....now that we have Infomart Dallas, really when you think about it, the interconnection and network routes to everything to the southern half of the Americas kind of flow to Equinix.

honestlyimeanreally;1518713324;7xrmxh;;38;;8;"Full disclosure: I'm new to stocks, but somewhat experienced with general investing. 

As many of you probably already know, there are rules against selling a stock at a loss and re-buying within 30-days -- this is because if it wasn't regulated, you could create tax-deductible loss events while still holding your desired stock, basically risk-free. 

Upon learning this fact, it made me wonder: is there anything preventing me from colluding with a friend or even corporation to avoid these restrictions? i.e. I sell at a loss from my account, creating a tax-deductible loss event, and then have a trusted friend (emphasis on trusted) buy shares on my behalf. That way, my loss is still deductible but any insane volatility within the 30-day period could be capitalized on. 

I'm guessing this is also illegal, but I actually couldn't find anything on this subject on Google.

The parents of my spouse died and left a small estate. In the estate is stocks in a major foreign corp in Finland that doesn't trade on any U.S. stock exchange.

My spouse has some kind of sentimental attachment to these stocks, unfortunately, and will not sell them.

Also unfortunately there's a huge barrier to getting information about these stocks from the bank they are being held at in Finland. Since I handle all our financial issues it's just impossible for me to get information to do our taxes, the fbar thing etc without being able to access and verify this information.

I need to know how to move these stocks to a U.S. based place to just hold them and have the dividends go into a U.S. based savings account.

Please understand I know next to nothing about stocks investing. We are not wealthy in the least and have done very little in the stock market during our lives. Now all of a sudden I have to deal with foreign stocks that don't even have a listing on an exchange here in the U.S.

I feel like I'm wading through endless irrelevant (to our situation) information about investing when all I want to know is how to get the stocks into a U.S. based account, where they will only be held not traded, so that we will be able to easily get the information we need to do our taxes and can easily move dividends to a U.S. savings account.

OrionBell;1518796167;7xzl7y;;32;;0;"The game we are playing is called bulls vs bears and everybody has to take a side. 

The bulls are market cheerleaders, and they dominate the media. Today they had Chinese New Year and a fluffy dog. The bulls can tell you all the reasons the market will go up. 'Business is booming' they will say. 'The fundamentals are great. You'll be lucky to find another dip like this to buy in on.'

The bears keep quiet for the most part because it's like playing craps and betting the don't. Everybody hates you. 

Bears and bulls come into conflict during different parts of the cycle. During a recovery, everybody is bullish. The bullish sentiment continues until the market is overbought or affected by external factors, and then some people turn bearish. On the way down, more people turn bearish. At the bottom of the cycle, there are a lot of bears, and they will turn bullish again during the next recovery.

So what is the advantage of being a bear early, like well before a market downturn? Nothing that you would notice right now. If you are sitting on cash, then nothing much is happening. It's pretty boring. 

The advantage happens later. Eventually, there is a market downturn and bottom. By the end, the bulls have sunk every last dollar they have into a declining market, and they are out of money, depressed, and out of the game. That's when the bears swoop in and take control. The former bears, holding old cash, suddenly turn bullish and go on a shopping spree. They buy stocks at bargain-basement prices, and enjoy years of profitable returns. Meanwhile, the former bulls are licking their wounds and vowing to turn bearish earlier in the cycle next time.

So when is the right time to turn bearish? Consider the risks and benefits of placing a bet. Suppose a bet wins 1/10 times and pays 10:1. Would you take the bet? Sure, because you're a player, and that's what we do. 

What happens if the return is the same but the risk is much higher? Then you think about conserving your bankroll and waiting for a better bet.

Bears sitting on cash are taking (nearly) zero risk. The reward they will get when they return to the market is likely to be huge. Bears only have to be right once.

Bulls have to be right all the time forever. It's very stressful for them.

provoko;1518797784;7xzs5u;;25;;74;"Whitelisting this due to the ban on pump &amp; dumps (rule 2.1), but since CNBC's investigation on the company, the stock won't be getting pumped anymore.

[Full article at CNBC w/ video.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/16/public-company-changes-name-to-riot-blockchain-sees-shares-rocket.html)

Basically some ""investor"" finds &amp; replaces the boards of shitty penny stocks, then buys a ton of warrants for cheap, does a company name change in the hopes it spikes, and finally sells his shares that he got for a ridiculous discount from the warrants.  [Timeline of what he did with RIOT.](https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2018/02/15/RIOT-final-rev.PNG)

I banned RIOT discussions back in November because it was obvious the stock was a pump &amp; dump:

* sales near zero
* company was originally a veterinary testing company (nothing to do with tech or blockchain)
* several  name changes:
 * Formerly=Bioptix, Inc. until 10-2017
 * Formerly=Venaxis, Inc. until 12-2016
 * Formerly=AspenBio Pharma, Inc. until 12-2012
 * Formerly=AspenBio, Inc. until 11-05

If you've been a victim of pump &amp; dumps, see [SEC's page on the topic](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answerspumpdumphtm.html); you can also make a complaint to [SEC here.](https://www.sec.gov/complaint/select.shtml)  Then read [Investopedia's art of selling a losing position.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/022002.asp)  Afterwards, stay away from micro cap stocks, if it has less than $300 million market cap, move on; try large cap stocks or mutual funds/ETFs until you can identify good stocks.

A) take profit  for investment and let your initial investment ride 
B) do you sell all and rebalance as someone said

If I understand correctly, CVS and AET have agreed to the deal and it is being voted on soon by shareholders, then will be reviewed by the government. It is expected to go through by mid 2018.

Assuming the deal goes through, CVS announced that Shareholders of AET will receive ($145 cash and .83 shares of CVS stock)/ share of AET stock. Currently a $204 value per share of AET

HERES THE IMPORTANT PART, If I read everything correctly The payout will not fluctuate, the deal is set as stated above, regardless of fluctuations in either stock.

I have a plan to make money on the stock market and would like to see if you can see any hole in my line of thinking and my trading strategy.

Ok, let's begin. I am not very smart but I figured out a way to make money online relatively easily. All I need is 10.000 $ and a trading account. 

I have been following some internet gurus like Sykes and others. I have lost some money trading forex. Now, after 3 years of studying I think I have a lot of knowledge but don't plan to stop and will continue studying.

The system to game the game is very easy. You just have to look on yahoo finance and look for stocks that are have risen for like 30 % and that have a lot of valitility and than you just buy and expect it to rise for example 20 - 100% before you get out, for security you just put the stop loss option.

The other way to do it is to listen to the ""scam artists"" that run pump and dump schemes and go in when they tell you to buy and be smarter and pull out after a small profit.

I don't know. I have had relative success doing this lately. Maybe its just luck because of a bulish market or am.I that good?

I don't understand a lot, but gurus like Sykes tell you that you just have to study and you will get rich..

A friend told me that it is impossible to win the game like this, that the stock market is essentialy a chance game and a zero sum game, that if things were that easy, a savy teenager could make a bot that could outperform me easily and that if that were that easy evryone would do it.

Can someone please tell me if this is viable strategy? I have quit my job to pursue a career in trading from home trough this system. If it doesnt work right away I plan to get a part time job and pour all my income into trading but at the same don't want to loose time and money just because I believe guys on youtube videos the tell me that it can be done.

 I would just like to share a resource that I find very valuable. I've came across a few resources on this website that have helped me tremendously. My favorite being Earningswhispers.com. So I just thought I'd recommend an information source to anyone looking to generate some ideas. When you first access FinViz it shows you a very detailed Heat Map.. You can even change the parameters of the map to show things like % of volume/average traded..5 Year EPS growth, fP/E, and dividend yields. Very awesome way of looking at it.  Also you can type in a ticker, and get soooo much information right in one place.  It's quickly becoming one of my favorite websites.

Baccayarro;1518834934;7y3z9h;;5;;4;"I want to make sure there isn't a better option than what I'm looking at doing, because it just doesn't make sense to me. I have been trading options for about a decade now. I buy once a month, and I sell once a month. I do this in both an IRA, and a traditional account. In the traditional account the taxes I am forced to pay drastically reduce my earnings. If I pay 28% in taxes, then the growth rate of the traditional is essentially 28% lower than the IRA. To use actual numbers, if I average a 35% return in my IRA, my traditional effectively only grows at 25%. 

This effect compounds exponentially, such that within 10 years the IRA has more than double the value of the traditional. So that even with the early withdrawal penalty, the taxes, and everything else, I still do far better investing inside an IRA even if I intend to spend the money in just a few years, and not wait until retirement. Put another way: short term gains are screwing my ROI so hard there is basically no reason to use a traditional account.

Am I missing something? Is there a better way I should be doing this? Maybe trading in some kind of entity, or with some other kind of tax deferment? I have no problem paying taxes on the money I intend to spend. But paying on earnings is killing me. Putting it all in the IRA, even for speculation, seems... wrong.";;IRA superior returns even with early withdrawal penalties?;

I am new to investing in the stock market and before I throw money around I've been researching and reading ""The Intelligent Investor"". One of the main principles Graham insists on using is Dollar Cost Averaging, where you buy stock X during regular intervals, say every month. My question becomes, since it costs money to perform a transaction, won't this strategy eat into any profits you make? Every month you'll be spending a decent amount of money just from transaction fees.

Also since I am new, was wondering if you would recommend any other resources to learn proper investing, preferably videos?

evangamer9000;1518904062;7y9q54;;1;;4;"While there are hundreds of stocks that everyone loves to talk about, there are also a few that slip under the radar and go unnoticed. ITT, I would like to share a personal favorite stock of mine that I have been following, and have owned, for about six years now. (Consider this the disclosure, I am long on this stock.)

Western Forest Products (WEF:TSE) or (WFSTF:OTC) is a small-cap lumber &amp; logging company based out of Vancouver British Columbia (from hereon I will refer to Western Forest Products as WEF). I believe that WEF has it's own moat, although it is small, the company has some growth catalysts that should not go unchecked. One reason that this stock is one that I have followed so closely for so long, is that they are in a very unique position. Not just financially, but geographically as well. A majority of their operations are on Vancouver Island which has some of the highest annual rain fall in the pacific Northwest, as well as having all of their facilities being positioned to take advantage of rail or seaport access. 

Currently, they have 6 mills that are running close to full capacity as well as 9 logging tenures that supply their mills internally as well as provide export options when their mills are saturated with supply. This bottleneck did occur on a handful of occasions before 2015, however this hasn't been an issue as of late due to their re-consolidation of milling volumes, and their successful $125M strategic capital program (approximately $100M of the 125M has been executed).  

The strategic capital program is probably one of the best uses of capital I have seen from a company that has proven to make quick returns while growing the business portfolio. Each of the mills received an array of improvements over the past 4 years, mainly the Duke Point, Saltair, and Ladysmith mills saw a bulk of the upgrades. The improvements made at Duke Point allowed for them to close down a lesser performing mill, effectively moving the closed mill volume to Duke Point which then pushed the returns even higher for the mill. 2017 was a year of generalized improvements across their entire asset base. 

WEF finished 2017 with a revenue of $1.1B, with a net income of $77M (adjusted EBITDA of $152M). Part of the strategic capital program was to help improve the companies operating margins and 2017 began to show this. Their books closed the year with no debt, $35M cash on hand as well as $269M in liquidity. With the rest of their SCP fully financed, the company is now looking for further growth opportunities. I expect this to be in the form of either biological assets (such as tree farms) or expanding distribution capabilities. Recently, they closed on a purchase agreement to buy a distribution center in Arlington Washington. This purchase was to help mitigate extra import tariff placed on Canadian timber products last year. 

While some look at the tariff as being a headwind it has only slightly dampened WEF's ability to sell it's product on US markets. Luckily, they are wildly diversified and do a lot of business with the far east (mainly China and Japan) and are now looking for more opportunities in Europe. WEF offers it's flagship product, Western Red Cedar onto all markets and has been showing extreme promise to provide ample revenue streams as countries look to build more environmentally friendly (WRC has one of the lowest carbon footprints for building materials). 

2018 should be another year of further growth, but should be increasingly accelerated due to increase demand from the far east, and management is expecting US housing starts to be higher YoY which will provide further opportunities. The Arlington Washington distro facility is expected to be fully operational by mid 2018, hopefully providing some return before the year end.

Again, just a disclose, I am long on this stock. Please do your own research. Feel free to give criticism, even if you hate my guts and think this was the worst stock write up ever. Thanks for reading! ";;Western Forest Products, a synopsis;

archeolog108;1519072334;7ypv7r;;0;;1;"For traders seeking a ticket to riches, the search for Alpha (outperformance over the market) is the main game…..otherwise just plonk your dough into an ETF that mimics a market index and save yourself the hassle.

So what is alpha and how do we find it? In general terms, alpha is an exploitable opportunity that exists from an informational advantage or repeatable behaviour that is not enjoyed by the general market participant. In essence you are looking for those exploitable ephemeral anomalies that may or may not exist in an otherwise efficient market that is characterised by Brownian Motion (or simple random price movement).

These opportunities may exist for a fleeting moment, such as a once-off opportunity from a unique informational advantage, or a more durable opportunity arising from the possession of a particular technology, informational advantage or repeatable behaviour. Alpha of more long term duration may be of a sporadic and unpredictable nature (eg. relying on a particular participant behaviour during extreme events), or be a more permanent and predictable opportunity over a period of time (such as a new technology, or informational insight). The bottom line is that when you combine these sporadic and more durable moments of alpha, you frequently find that these opportunities occur in clusters over a time series with long periods of random walk in between. This makes the game of finding alpha an elusive one.

zzzzoooo;1519074605;7yq6xn;;8;;0;"Hi,

Recently, I realize that some mutual funds give a great return, ranging from 10% to 25% annually. That leads me to ask myself if it's worth to spend more time and effort following closely the stock market in order to reach my personal goal of having a return rate of 10%. About 10 years ago, I've gained on average about 10-15% every year. I stopped investing in stock for a while now. I wonder if the normal goal is still about 10% annually. Or you gain much more than 10% at mid and long term ?


Let's say there's a fund whose its return rate is a solid 20% , would you still trade or you put your money on the fund and have a peace of mind (relatively less stressful than stocks) ?";;Mutual funds vs stock;

I’m an new to the stock market and have some money to invest. I would like to invest in high yield dividend ETFs. I currently am invested in HCAP, YYY and KBWD.

CODEPHENOM;1519093769;7ysgz1;;34;;69;"Hey everyone. Long time reader, first time poster. I came across Jetlines (JET) which is a new airline starting up this Summer. They're based in Richmond/Vancouver, Canada and are filling a pretty good segment of the market, between the bigger Air Canada and WestJet players. They're trading at $0.78/share, $45M cap, had a $1.15 high on Jan 3rd, have a number of social media campaigns going to promote their 'game-changing model', have their fleet of Boeings to be delivered in July and have a large part of their website dedicated to getting people to invest in their mission. 

Immediately, the low share price intrigues me as an amateur. My brain goes straight to ""Buy a thousand of those, make a ton and sell after the peak Summer season this year"" though I've been told it may be the wrong move. I think of JET as an airline I could buy into early and as a great deal (even though they haven't really done anything yet), but that's just me.

His company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) has become one of the most valuable in the world largely due to his investments, both in stocks and the companies he's bought. Investors who were lucky or smart enough to buy Berkshire stock in its early days have become millionaires as shares gained an amazing 1,826,163% from 1965 to 2015. That's an annual growth rate of 21.6%, more than double the 9.9% that the S&amp;P 500 has returned in that time with dividends included. 

Investors flock by the thousands to Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, and his aphorisms about economic moats, value, and other subjects have become virtual gospel in the market. 

However, like anyone, Buffett is a product of his time and generation, and as an 87-year-old, his perspective on investing is skewed by his age.

Too many of my stocks I cover are tech related, and this month I wanted to do something a bit different to give you guys some better exposure to other sectors that are out there to hopefully give you some insight to diversify yourself a bit. Please note that I did this write up on the weekend but didn't get a chance to post right now, so some of the stocks might have changed pricing slightly since.


&gt; # 1) Honeywell - HON
They are an American based company, but they have a worldwide reach. They produce a variety of commercial and consumer products, engineering services, and aerospace systems for a wide variety of customers, from private consumers to major corporations and governments. The company operates four business units (Strategic Business Units)
	* Honeywell Aerospace
	* Home and Building Technologies (HBT)
	* Safety and Productivity Solutions (SPS)
	* Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies
Honeywell is ranked 73rd in the Fortune 500. Their global workforce of approximately 130,000 and their most common consumer product (IMO) is their Thermostats or personal heaters, which many will recognize the brand from. This is actually a stock that I've personally been wanting to get into for a while because of their diverse product ranges and I believe it's more of a ""buy and hold"" stock, and they also pay a 1.93% dividend. It's good exposure to Aerospace as well if you don't like companies like BA, RTN, or LMT. We had an analyst come out in Feb from Barclay's who initiated coverage on $HON with overweight rating and price target of $170.
Looking @ the charts, $HON came down &amp; tested the 200 day MA. It's currently back above uptrend support and closed above 100 and 50 day MA last week, but found resistance at 20 day. IMO this is an ideal entry point and I would add more if it comes back down to test the 100 day or uptrend support again.	
	

&gt; # 2) Caterpillar - CAT
They design, develop, engineer, manufacturer, market and sell machinery, engines, financial products and insurance to customers via a worldwide dealer network. They are the world's largest construction equipment manufacturer and are ranked #59 on the Fortune 500 with close to 100,000 employees worldwide. This is another great stock to diversify from tech - and they pay a 2.00% dividend as well. We had an analyst come out in Feb from Argus with a reiterated HOLD - but they raised their target from $155 to $185
Looking @ the charts, $CAT came down to test the 100 day MA and is currently above uptrend support &amp; 50 day MA and is finding resistance @ 20 day. This is another ideal entry point - if it comes down to the 100 day MA, or even the lower uptrend support and 200 day MA to fill the gap, I would add a lot more.
	

&gt; # 3) Universal Display - OLED
This stock has had a terrible month - they started selling off before the market corrected, mainly due to ""weak"" iPhone X sales rumors and such. They develop and manufacture OLED display technologies and materials and I believe that OLED technology is the future of displays, and this company is at the forefront of that. They license their technology to companies like Samsung and LG so they get a lot of revenue there as well. I would consider this the riskiest out of the 4 in my list this month, but it is still a good growth stock. They pay a 0.08% dividend - almost negligible, but it's good to see they care about paying back their investors - even if its minimal. They didn't have any analyst action in Feb, but I suspect a lot in march as they will be reporting earnings this week on Feb 22.
Looking @ the charts, $OLED came down to the 200 day MA and bounced off of it. It then gapped up and broke through the 100 day MA, but found resistance at the 50 and 100 day MA. Right now it's in between some major uptrend support, but below its moving averages of 20, 50, 100 and the next catalyst to move this is their earnings. This is a good entry point, but you could wait until after earnings here to minimize your risk in the company (but also potentially miss out on a possible gap up and move higher).
	
	
&gt; # 4) Waste Management - WM
The final stock is another non-tech play and is pretty much is THE waste management company in North America. They have landfills, recycling plants, and power plants that they own and operate and they got an analyst upgrade in Feb from Raymond James from a Mkt Perform → Outperform, but no price target was set. They also pay a healthy 2.00% dividend, so this would be another good buy and hold-type company for the longer term if you want to diversify from tech.
Looking @ the charts, $WM came down to a strong uptrend support, which is also where its 200 day MA was, and bounced off of it. It then started moving higher and broke through 100, 50, and 20 MA, but then reported earnings last week and now it sits just above its 20 day MA. This is yet another good entry - we could see it move lower to retest the 100, but I see a lot of upside in this stock going into March.


I hope you guys enjoy these write ups every month. I would appreciate an up vote if you do :)

I have some old Disney shares dated May 15, 1992. 

It seems there was a 4:1 split with a record date of April 20 1992 that paid out on May 18 1992 (three days after the date on my paper certificate).

3) Their mentality has greatly shifted to exapansion, expansion, expansion much like Amazon has been past 10 years, especially online sales. Putting them ahead of other retailers by a wide margin. 
3) Revenue at $500B and Market cap only close to $300B? Revenue has been increasing steadily due to exapnsion and acqusitions. Amazon's revenue doesn't even cross $200B yet market cap is $700+B. Why is Amazon valued this high? Walmart has the money and footprint to expand just as fast if cards are played right. Jet.com has shown lot of growth.
4) Walmart.com has been providing free 2 day shipping without prime membership. Jet.com does as well. 
5) Most goods are cheaper at walmart or jet than Amazon. For example, most consumer products especially vitamins are cheaper at walmart.com than Amazon.
6) Walmart's ability to allow customers to pick up orders from stores. Sometimes same day pick up.

Yes, its Peter Schiff and yes he has been saying the same thing since ever but I was looking for videos around this time because it was a a year before the recession which is where I believe we currently are in the economic cycle. 

So interesting to see that we have come full circle. There's no mortgage crisis but we have more and more debt, yields are rising, we've had a strong run up in the stock market....I'd argue though, the American consumer is more fragile now then back in 2006.....more debt, less home equity, fewer full-time jobs, less savings etc";;This video clip from 2006 gave me goosebumps;

I don't plan to do this, but if I were to take out short position on $SHE and long position on $SPY (assuming they're similar sized positions) would this allow me to hedge market risk and bet solely against gender diversity?

Is there a better way to achieve this? Never tried this before, but I've been feeling uneasy about general market conditions and this would allow me to set up trades where I don't have to worry about the market.";;Market neutral hedges;

You have basically everything else, but I very rarely saw Mercedes being driven around for whatever reason

That coupled with Geely being able to now tap into Mercedes and their electrical vehicle expertise is a huge connection. I've been in for 3 months, missed the opportunity to buy more on their recent pullback

This is a screaming buy if you ask me. Especially since Beijing wants 90% of vehicles to be electric by 2025

I knew nothing about these guys until I started searching for some VR companies. They do augmented and virtual reality goggles. It looks like the company Leap Technologies has been around since before the tech bubble but hasn't done a lot since then. Rory has been working on these goggles for a long time, is backed by both Google and Alibaba and has released a few videos about the actual tech but the whole thing seems like fluff. It's a 6 billion dollar company now. People call it the secret start up but they are receiving a lot criticism online and have no announced clear release dates or prices. They're competition is Facebook and Microsoft hololens which is $4500ish (Magic Leap rumored to be $1-1.5k) really, Intel maybe too but they don't seem to holding as well.

DoU92;1519653940;80d897;;38;;50;"I'm considering buying the dip, do your DD and tell me what you think. Here are my thoughts:

A correction was definitely expected after amazon announced their plans for last-mile delivery. But, from what I found, Amazon deliveries make up between 5-10 percent of UPS revenues. Therefore, the 25 percent drop in UPS since mid January seems a bit harsh.

With e-commerce on the rise, there will continue be a growing demand for logistic companies. 

Also, UPS has been making great strides towards electrifying their fleet. They just announced they will be partnering with Workhorse Group, and sampling 50 electric vans. Tesla has also announced that they will be partnering with UPS to provide them with electric semi trucks. With electric vehicles becoming the cheaper alternative to gas and diesel, these  partnerships could be the beginning of something great, and really improve UPS's bottom line. 

I'm curious to see how Amazon goes about obtaining an electric fleet. Workhorse is a small company, and will have their hands full with the UPS partnership. I cannot imagine Elon partnering with Bezos, but that's just a gut feeling, and would love to hear everyone's thoughts on that. 

Will UPS continue to dip? Or is it ready to pop? Let me know what you guys think.

EminiEdge-Trading;1519690448;80hxnf;Trades;1;;0;"…So I was asked today: “How did you trade today?  Were you profitable?”  

My gut reaction was to respond with a yes or no answer, but after a moment I realized how quick traders are to fall into a trap.   Let me explain:

The initial part of the question asks how I traded today.  A good trading day is one in which I follow my well thought out and researched trade plan.  This includes all setups, entries, and specific exit strategies.  This plan is 100% formulated before the trade is placed each and every time.  There is not a situation in which I do not know how the trade will go, it is a finite series of “if – then” statements.  I may not know which path of “if – then” statements will be executed, but do know the probabilities of each one.  The plan is researched to the degree that I know, statistically, what percentage of these trades will be profitable, IF AND ONLY IF the trade plan researched and documented is followed to the letter.  Any deviation throws all the research and likely the entire plan out the window.  We should never be figuring out a trade plan while trading, this is too late!  So the question of how I traded is answered by how well I followed my plan, not if they were profitable or not.  So if the researched and documented trade plan is deemed to be profitable over some period of time then the question of profitability after one or two trades or one or two days is moot because I know if I follow my plan that there is a high likelihood that profits will be the inevitable outcome.  

So to answer the questions: 

“I traded excellent today, thank you!” ;)

ATribeCalledM;1519774017;80r87w;;21;;0;"Another day, another the world is ending post. People try to call tops and bottoms all the time but investors should be increasingly concerned with the amount of greed in the market right now, especially in the NASDAQ. Extreme greed is always the precursor to a crash. Using pivot point analysis, I will show you why the market is currently overextended.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;



What is a pivot point? Think of it as the point of equilibrium. By averaging the high, low, and close of a preceding time period, you get a reflection of the fair value of the market. For more info, read the link below
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


[Pivot Points Tutorial](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:pivot_points)
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Using the weekly chart, which derives the pivot point from the preceding year, you can see we are moving fast from equilibrium. Last year, the NASDAQ didn't touch the pivot point at all which shows greed and why many were calling for a correction. As you can see in the chart below, it also soared passed the R2 level. 
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


[2017 NASDAQ Pivot Levels](https://i.imgur.com/RnZU0JT.png)
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Now, even with the ""correction"" in February, NASDAQ has still not went back to equilibrium. Notice how the volatility increased once we got to the first resistance level in 2018. 
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

[2018 NASDAQ Pivot Levels](https://i.imgur.com/wO68U7v.png)
 &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


The longer NASDAQ goes without returning to the pivot, the more violent the crash will be. Remember, bubbles pop when they are stretched too far beyond equilibrium. 
&amp;nbsp;

I understand $NFLX has growth potential but so does $DIS, along with a greater array of assets. $DIS has better content, a streaming service, the top sports broadcasting network, a news network, a top movie studio and all of the Disney parks. With the high profile fox buy, $DIS acquired a majority holding in Hulu. Netflix has over 3 times more active users compared to Hulu, meaning there is more room for Hulu to grow than Netflix. $DIS now has the ability to optimize Hulu and stream their original content on the streaming platform, which should lead to greater future growth.

With all of this said $DIS stock has remained stagnant or decreased, while $NFLX has increased greatly. 

Can someone explain this to me or justify $NFLX valuation?

Dash-Parr;1519832835;80wzmn;;1;;1;"Hi everyone,

I am new to the investing world and am coming to realize that I have made mistakes. I just started investing in November and I am now looking at my investments wondering what I was thinking. I originally joined the fan-wagon of feedstocks and quickly made a good return of 80% in a month. After seeing this I jumped in even more and ever since it has gone down. I started researching investing and reading the intelligent investor and realized I've done exactly the opposite of what I now want to do. I am now down money and realize I would much rather invest in Vanguard etfs. I am wondering if I should just sell my stocks that I know nothing on and use that money to get in etfs. When buying these stocks I listened to others rather then doing research on my own, which was a huge mistake. I currently own:

Harvest One (down 50%)
Canopy Growth (down 5%) 
Enbridge (down 8%)

My question is, do you guys think I should cut my loses and re-invest that money in etfs for long term, or should I just ride the bus and see where my investments go. Luckily I don't have a huge amount of money invested.

Thank you in advance";;Advice with my portfolio;

paragoniq;1519835410;80xbjn;;9;;1;"The company I work for provides a 401k (but does not match), which I had been funding for about 2 years, putting in about $1000/month.
 
 
I moved to Puerto Rico and my company opened a PR branch just for me. It's all great, except that our HR platform (Trinet) now doesn't offer me a 401k option – even though the bank, TransAmerica, does operate 401ks in Puerto Rico.
 
 
Sucks, but I figured this is a chance for me to learn or put my money into some other financial vehicle.
 
 
I'd like to learn and start investing, but as I started reading the wiki, I noticed the [stick-my-money-somewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/stick-my-money-somewhere) link and it got me thinking:
 
 
Since the primary purpose of that ~$1k/month is really just to save for retirement (retirement plan), _does it make more sense to just add it to one of those target funds or put it towards starting out with investing?_ 
 
Would it make sense to go half target fund and half investing? Should I just try and invest?
 
 
Am I way off and just have the wrong idea altogether? Would appreciate any feedback on this!

james_htea;1519862664;810xyo;;8;;5;"Hello, I need your help :) 

I'm new in swing trading but I read a lot of materials before jumping in !
Got a few sucess first week (+3%), lost all during the second week (non-rational decision, stress haha).
I'm now more careful with my trades, I'm doing 3% so far for the third week.


I notice that there's some chart pattern that I failed ""to predict"" :confused:
Like a sudden drop, but everything was indicating an uptrend. Or a big triangle consolidation from nowhere.


Here's the first one AMD : 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/R33UX7F3/

The 14th everything was fine, big green candle that cross 8EMA - stoch was great.
There was a hammer confirmed a few days before and it did touch the Bollinger wave.
But on the 15 and 16th, there was a pullback from nowhere.

==&gt; is it possible to predict it with some tools ?
Or was it at least possible to be pretty sure that it was going to continue to raise after a few days ?


Second : NLSN
https://www.tradingview.com/x/TgYlrM6U/

Same here, during the last four days, you can see price touched a strong resistance line (and the Bollinger before that) - Piercing Line and a good confirmation.
Even more the price did cross the 8EMA...

But there's a drop the two last days.

Could I've predict that or it's just a part of probability that I have to deal with :/ ?


I'm using : 
Stoichastic RSI
Bollinger Waves
8EMA (sometimes 3EMA and 34EMA to see crossover)
Japanese Candles

I did check MACD or 20-50 SMA but I find the indicators I'm currently using less laggy and more accurate.

Maybe there's others tools that I don't know yet that can indeed predict (in the sense of making me more alert) about these sudden drop.
Because for now, it's just unavoidable...

Thank you for everything :D

debtinvesting;1520023788;81i1ss;;2;;1;"First of all I am Canadian. I am getting braces next week. I initially planned to pay it all in one single payment, until they told me that they don't charge interest. So I chose the 30-month payment plan. However the braces could be removed in as little as 18 months from now (14 months following the first payment), so I can't invest in two-year CDs/bonds with what would have been the 24-30th month payments.

&amp;nbsp;

After the initial payment, I am left with $6750, $225 a month, with the first payment being on May 1st. I would invest in March and keep the first $2700 in my 2.1% savings account in my TFSA (tax free account, yes we have Roth IRAs on steroids up here).

&amp;nbsp;

I am thus left wondering where to invest the remaining $4050. I am thinking either GICs, which are the equivalent of CDs (best I could find is 2.35%, maybe 2.45%), or bonds. Since I'm already buying in my TFSA tax free account, treasury or municipal bonds would provide no tax advantage. I have *some* default risk tolerance, as in a worst case scenario I could sell some equity to cover losses.

&amp;nbsp;

Two things that seem to me like they complicate things are the incoming interest rate increases in the US and possible increases in Canada, and the fact that I would have to invest $950 more in fixed-income instead of equity to reach the $5000 minimum. Or are there lower minimums available? Maybe a solution would be to buy on the secondary market?

&amp;nbsp;

I literally have zero experience with CDs/GICs and bonds, since my portfolio has always been entirely comprised of stocks, ETFs and savings accounts.

&amp;nbsp;

So basically, do I invest these $4050 in a savings account, CDs/GICs, bonds ($5k minimum or nah? secondary market to avoid the 5k minimum?) or some other fixed-income investment I don't know about? And is investing the first 12 payments in my savings account the best solution, or could I do something such as investing the first 6 payments in my savings account and the other 6 payments in some 6-month fixed-income investment?

Awmos;1520035339;81k5yt;;10;;8;"Hey all!

 Just wanted to get your thoughts on $MNST (Monster Energy Drink). So for the past year MNST has been an absolute beast. The stock has been trading sideways.  Yesterday after their earnings were released they took a massive tumble.  Down something like 13%. Their earnings were concerning because they failed to generate growth. However, the company still has a huge margin (62.9%) But they are a little overvalued with a fP/E of 39. 
  I wouldn't encourage anyone to buy just because it's on ""sale"". There are tons of profitable companies that are undervalued. The thing that makes this an attractive investment in the short term for me is that they just announced a $250 million buy back. This alone could make for a very profitable short term gain, along with the fact that it took a huge dip.

Would love to hear your thoughts, and of course.. Your criticisms.

MyOwnInception;1520095545;81r8zj;;17;;11;"I thought my comment would be more appropriate for a whole post, I believe not many people, including the Trump administration are not aware of the full repercussions of the tariffs.


**(Copying and pasting from my other post.)**

**If someone is aware of basic economics they will realise that no one wins a trade war. I will try to make this short, brief, detailed, and easy to understand.**
**This is a fairly easy concept but it seems as Trump and his administration haven't thought this out. Tarrifs would have chains reactions that would brutally affect us and allies/other countries**


* A trade war isn't that straight forward and will have a chain reaction felt globally
* An example of the previously mentioned (chain reaction &amp; not-fully-though-out detail) would be the trade deficit that Trump outcries. 
* The U.S. federal debt is getting bigger and bigger (currently $21 trillion) and could become $1 trillion more by next year. 
* The rising amount of debt the U.S. has, could lead to a hike in interest rates, because the U.S. Treasury would have to offer higher interest rates to borrow more money.
* This would increase the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses - including mortgage rates - seeing as the **interest rates track government bonds**
* What happens when the cost of borrowing for American businesses rises? The businesses can't grow as easily and quickly, and they will also have to offset the cost to borrow by *raising the prices of their own products.*
* Consumers of the products would have to pay more, the businesses would not make a profit/less profit if consumers can't afford the products.
* The biggest buyer of U.S. debt is China, it owns more than $1 trillion of our debt (government bonds).
* The reason why China is the biggest provider of the money we borrow is because of the trade deficit were in (which the president outcries).
* The trade deficit we're in is an incentive for countries like China to finance our debt because they have something to do with the extra-cash they get from the deficit.
* **If this trade gap shrinks**, China and other countries won't have much of an incentive to buy our government bonds anymore and that could make interest rates rise significantly (again, because interest rates of things like mortgages, etc tend to follow the interest rates of government bonds)

**Understood? Good, now take a look at what would happen.**

* If/when the Fed raises rates, tons of foreign cash will flow into the U.S. bond market because of the higher interest rates.
* Because of this, the dollar will rise compared to other currencies.
* When the dollar rises, this will raise the cost of U.S. exports and lower the price of things we import.
* Corporate profits will decline, leading companies to do multiple unfortunate things such as laying off workers, etc. therefore U.S. stock market will decline. (There will be no more earnings beats, investors will expect negative of the companies, EPS will decrease, lesser/no more dividends, no more share buybacks, etc)

**If you made it through, well, be happy, because the tarrifs haven't even passed yet. This may be quite a ride from here though.**";;How the Trump tariffs may actually cause a recession, when? That depends;

googlme;1520147803;81waqd;;56;;30;"Hi /r/stocks, 

Since the beginning of this year I was fortunate enough to invest quite a lot of money into stocks. Because this is quite new to me and in the past it worked out to listen to experienced people I'd like to ask for some feedback regarding my strategy. 

My plan is to invest around 40k$ a year in two parts. 20k each 6 months. I live in Switzerland and work for an American cybersecurity vendor. I have an account on Schwab but usually sell all my company RSUs and ESPPs once I unlock them because I'd like to have my money on a Swiss bank account. I am aware that I lose some % regarding commission but that's worth for me to have it all in Switzerland. 

**My portfolio looks like this at the moment. Because I work in the IT business I only invest in tech stocks:**

- 56 AMS
- 4 AMZN
- 75 ATVI
- 104 CRM
- 55 MSFT
- 70 APPL
- 46 BABA

up to now I am up around 5% overall. My yearly overall goal/expectation is around 5%


**I basically have some simple rules:**

* do not sell whatever happens
* only long term investment (3-5+ years)
* only invest money which I don't need

**My questions to you are:**

At the moment I don't really have any spare money to invest, but every 6 months I'll have around 20k to invest. How much money should I have in free cash flow for ""buying the dip"". Is this something which I should consider or just buy some more stock when I have money to do it? 

I already have a good diversity in my opinion with 7 different stocks and my plan was to not extend the different stocks (because on day I will sell and I'll pay way more commission then). Is this something which is not really important in a long term strategy? 

Any tips and feedback is welcome. 
Thanks

According to this article, Sweden's smoking has gone from 50% to 5% among active smokers.

In October, Swedish Match also announced that Switzerland has now made it possible to order snus from Sweden. Switzerland has become the first country in Europe that allows snus consumption. 

""Based on available evidence, for chewing tobacco RRs were significantly higher than one for oral cancer and esophageal cancer, while for snus or snuff we did not find sufficient evidence of a RR greater than one for any health outcome.""

""There are sufficient evidence that chewing tobacco and other products of similar toxicity cause excess risk of oral and esophageal cancer while at this time, existing evidence does not support attributing the burden to snus or similar smokeless tobacco products. Globally, smoking tobacco causes far more burden than smokeless tobacco "".

Source: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32366-8/fulltext

Swedish Match is now close to an ATH, is it worth investing in order to keep long-term or is there also a chance for more short-term profits? In principle, the company owns the entire snus market and has good financials. Indicators show that the stock will dip short-term, but the company's strong financials and possible healthier alternative to smoking gives Swedish Match excellent future growth potential. The question is if snus will catch on in Europe, or if smokers will instead use other ways of quitting such as nicotine gum etc.

QuantalyticsResearch;1520258108;8262a1;;0;;1;"Is it safe to say that the days of record low prices for crude oil are long gone? Production cuts from OPEC have stabilize global crude oil markets ~USD$60/barrel for the short-run.  Now that global crude oil prices are stabilizing, where can investors and traders invest in energy?

Investors may want to consider US E&amp;Ps given that total cash break-even costs for US shale E&amp;Ps are estimated to be ~USD$40/barrel based on internal research at Quantamize. Forward multiple for the US Energy Sector look attractive with the S&amp;P 500 energy sector trading at a Fwd 12M P/E of 15.5x with an expected annual EPS growth rate of 30+% for the next 3-years; this translates to a PEG ratio of 0.5x which means the forward 12-month multiple investors are paying for forward earnings is at a discount to the rate of growth for future earnings. 

Over the past few weeks, Quantamize has highlighted a few attractive options trades in the US energy space: XOP (US E&amp;Ps ETF) Bull Call Spread and a SLB Bull Put spread.  When Quantamize highlighted the Bull SLB Put Spread, 1-month implied volatility for SLB was implying a 5 standard deviation downside move. In comparison, SLB as top name in our US Large-cap Multi-Factor Quant model. 

Investors and traders may want to consider future opportunities in the US energy sector given that valuations remain cheap while the prospects for the sector are improving sequentially.

Noqt;1520283983;829col;Ticker Discussion;24;;59;"$NVDA is a gaming company. It has been since its inception. Most recently, Nvidia has been big into Artificial intelligence. Most headlines reference something to do with AI. I think this transition from gaming to AI is important for Nvidia's growth in the next decade. My price target for them is a 40% upside, $329. Is that even possible given how much it's grown this past year? I think so. 


[Here is the google drive with the model, paper, and open position proof, updated whenever I update them](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h2cTeiNRP07K8-2Wn4lYyQtbB_go2HGB?usp=sharing)


I'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks:


Catalysts


* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.


* Cryptocurrency becoming more popular. Crypto isn't going away, so I'd assume it to be a catalyst. I don't like to pay attention to it. 


* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.


* Gaming industry big news (PC). Every year there is more gamers, every year gamers get better jobs, every year there are more games. GPUs are an integral part to gaming, so these revenues will grow with the gaming market.


Risks:


* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.


* AMD/new GPU designer taking market share from Nvidia. Unlikely, but Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market is why I am so bullish. I want to invest in the leader of AI deep learning training hardware and graphics processing, not the second best.


* Jensen Huang, the CEO, losing his ability to lead the company. Nvidia has has successfully positioned themselves to be a part of the future of AI, which I think is accredited to Huang's execution. This is a positive, he's invested in the company. The downside to this is that he is very important and anything that hurts his ability to lead would hurt Nvidia.


* New GeForce 20 series being not much of an upgrade from series 10, possibility but I think unlikely. Unlikely because their Titan V uses 12nm technology.


Price Target:


* I used a DCF model to arrive at the price target of $329, using a 7% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate. In the model I assume 39% revenue growth in Nvidia's 2019 fiscal year, 32% in 2020, and 28% in 2021. I based this off their plans in autonomous driving, and their new GeForce series to be released with Volta architecture. 


What I think:


I think Nvidia successfully integrating its hardware into so many big company's is a huge success for their long term goals. Nvidia hardware is being utilized in Tesla's electic car's autopilot 2.0, and used by Google and Amazon Web Services datacenters. Nvidia is so dominant that no one can take these positions unless the company wants to build their own chips, which would be billions of dollars in R&amp;D. Nvidia is supplying hardware for these big companies and there is no one to compete.


TLDR: NVIDIA is investing into AI. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 operates Tesla's autopilot 2.0 system, Nvidia's new Tesla GPUs have grown datacenter revenue by 133% this last year, and their focus on the narrow AI to bring autonomous vehicles on the road is proving to be worth it. $329, long equity. 


Why am I doing this?


Well I don't think I am perfect and I think I missed A LOT, so I want some critisism to get as close to perfection as I can. Read the paper and look at the model.

Scale can make one graph look more volatile making it feel like a leading indicator sometimes when it shouldn’t. How often is this intentional bias?

I feel like default scales making their endpoints overlap should remove most bias. This usually isn’t possible. This is why normalizing data (into fluctuations around a mean) making their endpoints overlap removes most bias and makes things clear

Alternatively use scales that make the original data intersect around inflection points which adds bias but at least make the message more clear (this is typical)

iknothing;1520409243;82mmik;;18;;15;"NFLX is struggling with their cash flow, but I believe they are focusing on what they found is their momentum, focusing on content and reaching various audience will help them. Because of this factor, they are leading against their competitors with the highest budget for content spent. One thing that will help netflix is bringing in newer shows, if they struggle with adding new content this would lead people binge watching everything and left with nothing left to watch. And netflix will be left with really high expense. 

What's risky about netflix and for investors

* Shows like bright. High budget production like this if it fails, and if viewership is low for shows like this, netflix will struggle big time. Netflix opinion about this show is contrary to what the internet feels about this show. based on how internet feels about bright, It would be relieving to just  know people are boot-legging this show.

* It's hard to know which shows are self produced by netflix, and which are licenced. Two shows that were successful and are self produced by netflix are stranger things and orange is the new black (according to the internet).
* 
* Competition from amazon and apple. These Giants bundling up their services. I still don't know why Amazon didn't bundle everything up yet, if they bundle up their prime shipping, prime music, prime video and  audible books this would be a direct threat, even though amazon content is not comparable to Netflix, it will feel to some customers they are getting more than they paid for. Also Amazon has a lot more money than Netflix to push new content on their streaming service.
* 
* Netflix is burning free money- They are pretty much experimenting with content creation.

What helps netflix Investors.

* Netflix does not provide detailed statistics of  their most watched shows which helps them increase their subscriber list, nor do they tell you what's on netflix, unless someone really does vigorous research to find what's on netflix, easiest way to know whats on netflix is buying the membership. It can be assumed that the shows that stay on netflix is probably their most watch show.
* 
* Fees are cheap people forget about it, it cost approximately one mcdonald meal per month or ~.50 cents a day. ";;NETFLIX IS Profitable. Just not as much. Profit margins are just low.- Review;

I am a 24 year old who started working barely a year ago. What started as a small experiment with 3 AAPL stocks is now standing at over a 1100$ gain. This sub has always been the starting point for all my research. I come here to check what’s new, read the comments, then work backwards and start researching before I buy, sell or hold anything. 

I never wanted to hold long and the plan was to always swing trade on a company during its earnings. Gradually, I started making educated choices, became confident and started holding, did not panic sell but doubled down whenever the market dropped and here I am. From shares pricing in the future effects to investors moving towards Gold at times of nuclear threat and towards bonds when their yield increases; this sub has taught me a lot. 

The gains might not last long but I am glad I made it till here. I just wanted to thank you all. You guys are awesome. 

Portfolio:
AAPL - got in at 152, 164
NVDA - got in at 154, sold at 200, got in at 200 
SHOP - got in at 80, doubled down during the Citron dip
NFLX - got in around 160 and sold at 240 (regret big time)
TWTR - got in at 19 and sold at 21
SQ- got in at 37
AMD - got in at 11 and out at 13.5
 
I have decided to stay in the game long and I am now waiting for the next dip to invest in,

Edit: YES. It is a bull market. Anyone could have made money. My whole point was that, I started making decisions based on the sub. I could have still made money but not 30 percent.

SweatyPanda42;1520565474;833ls5;Advice Request;10;;13;"So I'm new to investing in stocks but I'm really trying to learn. I understand I should only invest in things I know and understand and aim to stay with them at least 5-10 years. I think Boeing would be a good company to invest in so I created a small analysis. I know this is lacking many things I should probably know before I invest in a stock, but is this analysis on the right track? What did I do right and **What can I improve on** and **add** to this? **Also please keep in mind** I wasn't originally planning on posting this or anything. I was just trying to write this for me and see if it's a good stock to invest in **So I apologize for all my grammatical errors.**

First Glance

Boeing designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcrafts, rockets, and satellites worldwide. It is one of the largest aircraft manufactures and 2nd largest defense contractor in the world based on revenue from 2015. It is also the largest exporter in the United States by Dollar value. It is 101 and 1 years ago. This is a huge company with lots of employees and different work divisions. It's obviously an industry leading company but still has room to grow as science and technology advance. Also as more things move to the aerospace this only gets better. Throughout the years as it has had big projects canceled, it has bounced back with new technologies.

Culture 

Not as much info into the culture of the company. For the most part employees seem to approve of their CEO and enjoy their workplace. Boeing also seems to promote learning and helping things outside of just their company. Their culture is not perfect but does seem to be good enough.


Visionary Leaders 

Dennis Muilenberg is the CEO of Boeing. He took place after the old CEO stepped down after 10 years. There's not a ton of info on him but he seems to be a good leader who has worked at Boeing for over 30 years. So he knows the company well. He has been apart of many differen management divisions in the company and is a good leader. He started as an intern so was hands on. He loves aerospace, working with people, and management.


Competitive Advantage

It's a huge company and has a strong brand name. It has a international presence across more than 140 countries. It also has strong relationships with other companies, even competitors like Lockheed. It has a very large production line. It has a strong, strategically positioned global distribution network. They team up with other suppliers from different countries to develop technologies and design concepts. Which helps it gain market in these other countries, because companies who have a stake in Boeing are more likely to buy from it than competitors. They also work with many different companies to develop their technologies.


Growing Industry

As technology advances and gets better new creations we haven't even imagined yet will be created. Aerospace engineering is growing rapidly and the demand for everything Boeing makes will only increase, not decrease.";;Is this a good stock analysis of boeing?;

I am a part time options trader who has enjoyed the management and discipline of small accounts. I have never been flagged as a day trader, and carefully manage the weekly round trips. On Friday I had 2 round trips available, but three open positions, and I really wanted to close everything and lock profits before the weekend. But I knew I’d be flagged as a PTD once I did. So I sweated it out and closed everything once I was over 25k, just before the close. And am now via Ameritrade considered a PTD. 

So this is an interesting problem to have. I only trade options, and don’t plan on making round trips until I’ve built up the account cash margin. A  few questions:

- Does the FINRA flag apply to me or the account? Meaning, does the flag follow me to other accounts I open up in the future, or just this account? 

- If I dip below 25k I can still trade, but can’t make round trip day trades, correct? 

- I can clearly see how PTD status could lead to emotional over trading. No bueno. Any of you have specific PTD strategies that serve you well?

* **Netflix**: They don't just stream movies and tv shows, they're much more than that. They've revolutionized the game, I have yet to meet an adult [born in the 1990's] that does not watch Netflix's content. Their content is amazing &amp; their vision for the future is optimistic. Only one that can stop Netflix's growth is Netflix. No, Disney will not stop Netflix, regardless of what they do.
* **Facebook**: Zuckerberg is a gangster. I think FB is massively undervalued. With the upcoming Virtual Reality tech coming about in the next decade, I think FB will be the front leader of the virtual reality world, connecting people all around the world w/ the said tech. People were wrong about FB's acquisition of Instagram, they're now underestimating the impact FB will have w/ VR.
* **Microsoft**: Cloud cloud cloud. As someone who works in a software company, I can tell you that Microsoft has done everything right the past few years. I think w/ IoT devices coming about, Microsoft will be a front leader w/ connecting devices with each other and allowing software companies to take full advantage of that tech.
* **Apple**: I think everyone knows how dominant Apple is already. I think they have too much of a dominance for one to miss out on. It's become a religion for Americans, so there is no doubt on my mind that they will keep growing.
* **Google**: Artificial Intelligence. They're so far ahead of companies, it's unbelievable. I think they hold the future of in the AI market.
* **Alibaba**: E-commerce leader in China. A lot of people are skeptical about Chinese companies, but numbers don't lie. They are dominant in Asia, and I see them expanding heavily in other markets (A.I, e-sports, etc.) 
* **Tencent**: The FB of China basically, with additional influence over the game industry as well. E-sports is growing rapidly, and they'e investing heavily into it.
* **Visa**: Solid company that will always have a place in my portfolio. In a world where we are moving away from physical money to digital money, VISA will not slow down its growth.
* **Paypal**: Many small and medium businesses rely on Paypal transactions. I see Paypal venturing in other markets, a possibility for them to allow businesses to open up on opportunities. I don't believe they necessarily need to dominate on Ebay to grow.

Ed_Snate;1520715855;83hzkw;;11;;1;"Autodesk (ADSK) shares popped this week.

Given what I heard from the conference call, I didn't expect ADSK to do much.  To me the headline was nearly identical to the headline last quarter... a beat on top and bottom lines... and subs were lower... essentially the same headline that cratered the stock about 15%.  

While they did announced a layoff last quarter, there was no such layoff this quarter... so that's a positive... but, maybe balancing that was the guided lower this quarter vs. higher last quarter... which is usually a big negative.

Clearly the stock was on fire in the after market after this quarter's report came out... and that carried through to the next day trading as well... up almost 15%.

So I think it's swung too far.  I can see the positives in the quarter temporarily taking out the old high (around $131)... but it just hit $140 today... that seem too much... feels like it should be trading at 125-130.  (Notably today ADSK seems to be lagging behind the rest of the on-fire market.)

In addition, I wouldn't put it past Trump to roil up the markets again soon... and, there really should be a second leg down from the midi-crash of a few weeks ago... we have come very far very fast.

So, I think ADSK is a good candidate for a short-term trading short.

Encouragedissent;1520742588;83kliy;;48;;15;"Im Interested if this sub share the same advice as investing, maybe I can just admit im wrong.

Right now I have about 70k dollars. I owe 80k on my Mortgage. 50k is in my Merrill Lynch account, with 20k in checking and I have a credit card through BOA as well.

I only have about 15k invested in stocks and 10k in stock derived ETFs. I also have 15k invested in ETFs that track short term maturity bonds, ones with almost no volatility like 13k in MINT and 2k in SCHZ. 10k I have in cash for when I see investment opportunities but Im thinking about throwing more of that into MINT cause why not. It only makes me like $20 a month, just slightly more than a savings account does. The only reason I use MINT and not a savings is I can get like 30 free trades a month by having over $50k with BOA(who owns Merrill lynch) so getting free trades is far better than putting it all in savings, like through Ally savings or the likes. It also increases the rewards on my credit card by quite a bit so im getting another $20-30 a month on just over $1k of spending. (CC is paid off every month obviously)

Im curious if the sub thinks im taking unnecessary risks by even investing at all? I feel like investing in stocks helped get me to where I am at right now, so pulling out 100% would be quite boring. Ive already halved some of my investments and liquidated a few others to switch over to ETFs and try to minimize risk. Today I made about $350 only on a very strong day for example while having it all in SPY would have made me $870. Much less volatile.

Right now my goal is to make it to 82k total then completely liquidate and transfer it all to checking, get a payoff quote, and then pay off my mortgage.

Since I will be quite poor. I will quickly build an emergency fund and make sure I have enough to pay my property taxes, dividends, and capital gains next tax season(I claim 0 which will help). Finally next year I start up again with my new investment strategy, long term dollar cost averaging. I will probably have to switch to (free broker RH) as well because I will lose my free trades otherwise.

What the market does will affect how long it takes for me to have enough to pay off my mortgage. It could be as soon as next month if we rocketship past our previous highs(I get a $3k bonus in April) or it could take till the end of the year if things get really ugly. If I liquidate now I wont have enough till possibly October.

Info I left out 26 years left @ 3.5%. Not enough interest for me to file itemized deductions so I dont even save 25% on it in taxes.

TLDR: Are my current goals of saving up to pay off my mortgage with a split of stocks and bond etfs good, or should I sell my stocks now and put $60k in MINT which will only get me $100 a month almost risk free(same as savings pretty much)?";;Pay off mortgage, or invest in stocks?;

Hi everyone,

There is a person posting (or should I say spamming) all the finance and investing subreddits about a company called Patriot One Technology. He plays naive asking what everyone’s opinion on the company is and then has shill accounts post positive or optimistic comments of the company. My guess is he somehow believes he’ll be able to influence stock price by driving investors to it who heard about it online.

I created this post because I love this community and the world of investing. There are a lot of people coming here looking to learn and seeking advice from others. I know I’ve learned quite a bit from subreddits like this one. I love a good shitpost every now and then but I don’t like people trying to manipulate and take advantage of those who are inexperienced, gullible, or new to things trying to learn. That crosses a line in my books as corny as that may sound.

If you look into these posts and the comments at first, a naive or inexperienced person may think this looks like an attractive company full of potential listed at a bargain price. They may see others praising it and decide to put their own money into the company stock themselves. Yet, a little digging would show this poster is spamming all the related subreddits with this company, creating shill accounts to praise it, and even made a YouTube video all in an effort of trying to lure people into this Canadian pennystock that deals with security systems conveniently after the recent string of mass shootings in the US.

Don’t be fooled and let these people take advantage of you. Greed is a part of life, especially in the world of finance and investing. Do your own research, listen to others advice carefully yet cautiously, take time to learn how markets and companies work, and don’t blindly follow the advice of strangers, especially those online in a forum involving money related matters.

The mods here do a solid job of keeping this community running and I don’t want this post to discourage discussion of new, small, niche, or exciting companies. If you see anything strange like the poster here, don’t be afraid to call them out or report them to the mods. Let’s keep this subreddit going strong.

Lots of companies have competitors with similar products (i.e. if Chevron went away, I'd get super unleaded from Exxon or BP. No more Aquafina (Pepsi), I'll get a Dasani (Coca-Cola) instead. Fair argument, it seems.

HOWEVER, a company with such little differentiation (such as Amazon) should NOT be giving the ludicrous valuation multiple that it has. In fact, it's treated as a ""tech"" company (FANG) alongside REAL innovative companies such as Google (Google 3D maps, streetview, cloud, etc). when it's nothing more than a retailer masquarading as something special.

Awmos;1520840914;83t9na;;30;;15;" So I can't help but notice tons of people making jokes about and hating on $MU.  I understand there's is a fair amount of hype surrounding it, I've even heard their enthusiasts referred to as a cult on this forum.  I for one discovered MU through a screener. I saw that they had a forward PE of 6, analysts continually raising expectations, a huge demand and growing potential for their products in everything from AI to automotive, tons of cash, very little debt, and profit margins of 25%.  Since I bought that stock, it's gone up about 15% and it's still soooo undervalued. I mean Amazon has a p/e of like 1400... the best investment banks in the world average with p/e's of around 20. So where does all of the criticism come from? Is it lodged in something real that I'm just not seeing ? Or are people just bitter that they didn't buy the dip or get in a month ago?  How can you be upset at a company for having amazing fundamentals with huge growth that has made a ton of people some really easy money? 
Anyways, I really would love to hear some actual criticisms in regards to why it might be overvalued or unattractive to some. I have yet to hear any actual points. Just stupid comments about the people who own it.  I am just really curious to see where that criticism comes from because I feel like I'm missing something.";;How do you hate on a stock? ($MU);

I was thinking of getting $BRK.B as a big chunk (20-25%) of my portfolio instead of buying ETFs or any other index funds.

However, given that most of its success is accountable to Warren himself, does it mean that the company is exposed to major share price decline risks in case of his death? He is 87 after all.

For instance, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust has 15 holdings in it, BRK.B being 63% of it (seconds biggest Caterpillar with 7.1%) - is that not too risky?

Thanks for your opinion.

[deleted];1520994721;849yp4;;1;;1;;;My thoughts on risk;
bxk259;1520995914;84a31b;;1;;0;"Ever heard of this word – Risk? Yes, Risk?

Risk is the most commonly misunderstood word in both life and investing. Wherever you go, whoever you talk to, everyone seems to think of risk as something that is absolute. One can’t be more wrong. Risk is not absolute. It is relative. It varies from person to person and from situation to situation. Yes, you read that right. Same event can be riskier to one person whereas its not so risky to the other. It depends on one’s age, experience, financial position, education and a thousand other factors.

For example, when a person comes to you and says that start-ups are risky, all it means is that start-ups are risky for him. He is portraying his view of risk onto yourself. As most people accept that risk is absolute, they tend to conclude that start-ups are risky. If the person who is portraying that view is well known, that effect is even stronger. That’s what happens in both life and investing. We fall prey to these little things that prove to be very costly later on.

I will give you a real life example. Generally speaking, people who are in their 60s or 70s tend to own bonds because they are “safe” investments. For them, stocks are “risky” investments. The same stocks are not so risky for a person in his 20s or 30s who has a good understanding of financial markets. If the person in his 20s believes that risk is absolute and invests in bonds, his retirement fund will look like a drop in the bucket by the time he retires.  Yet all across the world, people evaluate portfolios based on sharpe ratio, beta and risk adjusted returns. That assumes that everyone in this world has the same risk appetite. How wrong. Some people are more than happy to accept more risk and accept the same returns even though it lowers their sharpe ratio. They have their own reasons for that. Yet, we compare portfolios and debate on whose allocation is better.

Bottom line, never do something because someone else is doing. It doesn’t make sense from a risk perspective.

roskalov;1521023195;84cbxr;;21;;2;"Hello there,


I started investing recently and go long only, hence try to choose those securities that have a potential over the next 30-40 years ideally.

I have noticed on this sub that many people are quite sceptical about Amazon and their PE of 200+.

However, I have looked at their report (Dec 2016 is the most recent one) and I thought it would be wise to also consider their net capital growth in addition to net income.

Example:

In 2016 their net income was $2.37bn, which constituted to $5.01 per share (hence the PE).

However, they also got a net capital gain of about $17bn ($20bn assets -$3bn liabilities).

In my view, that is another $17bn of ‘real’ income, which is 7 times more than the net income figure.

Therefore, would that be fair to say that the PE (capital gain adjusted) would then be 7 times less, hence circa 30? Not theoretically of course but as a common sense fact - that $17bn capital growth should not go unnoticed.

Hence my point that Amazon is a great long investment.

Thanks for your opinions.

They look cheap compared to their historical ratio's and compared to competitors such as $snap and $twtr and I think it's pretty clear their are well managed and have the ability to bring in tons of ad revenue regardless of their restructuring of their ""news feed"". 


Young people might not like Facebook anymore, but they seem to be obsessed with instagram. That plus the recent surplus of ""entrepreneurs"" and ""models"" using instagram as ways to promote their content makes me think their user base will continue to grow.


Internationally there may be issues with China and Russia wanting them to store their cloud database in their own countries. This could potentially lead to more regulation and restrictions in those countries. There's also the whole Russia meddling problem, but the impact of that is hard to quantify.


Looking at their competitors, it looks like Snap is its only threat, but they have been able to match all of Snap's improvements without losing market share and Snap has continued to struggle bringing in advertisements without taking away from the user experience. Twitter is another competitor, but I see them being used completely separately and not competing as much.  Oculus Rift obviously has much more competition than their social media platforms do, but I don't see investors being too optimistic about VR as a whole anyways.  I am unfamiliar with oversees competitors so I that is something I need to research more.


Historically, it seems like they make great acquisitions(maybe not Oculus, but time will tell) and they are not eager to burn cash and make dumb acquisitions just for the sake of diversification(compared to twitter and snap).


One thing that has brought me to look at them as an investment is their launch of Facebook Watch, which was launched 6 months ago. I haven't spent too much time on it, but I really like what they have done with ""Tom vs. Time"" which in my mind proves they can make good content with their partners. Only issue with Watch is the partners will take the majority of the ad revenue(also not sure if partners include original content creators like youtube or strictly corporations so I need to do more research on that end).  They tried to make a big push to bring content creators from Youtube, iirc, 2 years ago and I they obviously didn't have much luck, but this could be a big breakthrough.


Financially they are a strong company with growing earnings. They have plenty of cash available so they are capable of making more acquisitions without taking on too much debt or selling equity.

ScottyStellar;1521069548;84hy0d;;15;;37;"Good evening /r/stocks! Welcome to the first weekly post on my Insider Track experiment. Was excited to see a lot of interest in my earlier post about this idea, so here we are to start things off!

Goal of project: See if using some basic research on insider transactions can help 'beat the market' by purchasing stocks with multiple recent insider purchases, and no recent insider sales, at or around the price of recent insider purchases.

Rules:

* Initial start with $2,500, aiming for a portfolio of 25 stocks

* Use VTI as my index for benchmarking

* When I want to buy more, I will sell a stock, preferably one of the highest profiting ones, or one that has been stagnant for too long. (Any suggestions of a better rule for sale price/time targets would be great)

* Report all purchases and sales in weekly post, as well as updates on performance vs. benchmark, and lessons learned.

* As value of portfolio increases, so will amount invested into new stocks, proportionally (total value divided by 25 will be initial investment amount to each new stock, approximately)

* Updates based on results after market close on Wednesdays, to post Wednesday evenings

* Most research on new stocks will likely be done on the weekends due to work schedule

Disclaimer: I hold stakes in all stocks at the price included in the spreadsheet. I am not a fiduciary, financial adviser or broker, and am not offering any investment advice. This is merely for my own personal interest and learning, and a project I am happy to share with you. I am receiving no financial incentives nor compensation for this project, and am not asking you to invest with me. 

**First Update**

[See the performance here](https://imgur.com/qgXyvNr)

I started off with just 6 stocks, and have decided to expand to 25 stocks, currently sitting at 22 with recent purchases made this week.

As you will see in the profit/loss column, the portfolio currently sits at just under **$89** profit, with growth of **4.12%** since inception.

More interestingly is the **$ Gain vs VTI column** which represents how much each stock is up or down versus if I had invested the same amount into the VTI at the time of purchase. You'll see currently the portfolio has made about **$82.69** more than the VTI.

Since inception, 11 stocks are beating the VTI by greater than 1%, 4 are trailing, and 7 are flat (beating or trailing by under 1%).

I really admire the guy's extreme curiosity and ability to add a sensible narrative to things (though admittedly mostly in the entertainment world.) I really think he could make some insightful stock picks.

Joe Rogan is another guy who is really really turning into one of those people with their finger on the nation's pulse. He's growing one of those types of networks that you wonder who he *can't* pick up the phone and call considering the wide range of people he has on his enormously successful podcast. He definitely isn't into finance (he did have Peter Schiff on his podcast once, but I'm really not a fan of that guy, it wasn't a good pocast.) I would kill to hear Jim Cramer go on his podcast. I know many people here aren't a fan of Cramer, but I think if you look past the gimmicks (which can be annoying I admit) and keep in mind that he is just giving advice and not promising sure things he really is a smart person. Also, the amount of shit he has seen over the last 35 years both in and around Wall St would make for some tremendous stories.

Another guy who is very insightful (though I may not agree with his politics and think he has a tendency to jump to conclusions) is Malcolm Gladwell. I think he would only be useful in very limited situations, but I could see him approving/calling bullshit on a stock phenomenon or two. I think he would be the celebrity hedge fund short specialist.

The guy who I think would be the worst at it is Bill Burr. He is my favorite comedian, but I'm pretty sure he would go 100% Gold and then decide that it's all bullshit and stick his money into a Nike shoebox lolol. Love the guy though.

Fundamentals and all of those ratios that we look at are important, but so are the long term stories that we most believe in that get people to vote with us in this massive ""popularity contest"" that is the market. I got a bit off topic here but I think the one most important thing for us all to do is to inspect those quarterly earnings reports. It is where the numbers and the narrative meet, and listening to those calls and pouring over that quarterly PDF is just so important imo.

ShadowK2;1521120271;84mezt;Advice Request;5;;3;"Hey Guys, so I currently keep about 32k in a ROTH IRA and 80k in a (Mostly ROTH) 401k. 

The 401k only allows mutual fund purchases... I can't buy stock or EFT's, so i'm stuck in boring but solid funds like Vanguard Target Date 2060, Vanguard High Dividend Yield, Vanguard total stock market index, vanguard international stock index, and some random Fidelity IT fund.

I'm only 25 years old, and I want to do something exciting with my ROTH IRA since the 401k is so bland and boring.  I have simulated an investment style of picking individual stocks based on this criteria:

1.) Choose 3 market sectors that analysts agree are poised for growth in the next 6 months to a year.

2.) In each of the 3 market sectors chosen, choose 3-4 large-ish cap stocks that have the highest analyst score.  I really like the Thompson Reuters StarMine score... they seem to be the most accurate, but I would like to consider the opinion of multiple market analysts.

3.) Now I own about a dozen stocks with high analyst ratings in market sectors that are theoretically poised for growth.

4.) Keep tabs on changing analyst scores.  It seems like it would be prudent to basically sell everything and re-allocate every 6 months to a year using the same strategy.

Anyways, I've run some simulations and looked at investing this way, and it seems to be a valid way to attempt to beat the boring mutual fund returns.  I don't mind the hands-on investing approach as investing is just way too much fun!!

This seems like a low-brains approach for someone who is just getting into the financial world.  I feel like it is best for me to lean heavily on analyst opinions at this point.  Any input from my fellow reddit investors?";225413;New Way of Investing my Roth IRA;

I have a small holding of SND because I believe that their stock is undervalued and I believe their services will be needed for as long as I am interested in holding them. Not going to sell.

I saw it as already undervalued because of the PE ratio and I thought it's place in the market was fairly stable.

I felt validated when it opened up a little in the morning but now it is down 12% or so. I don't plan on selling it but I am upset that I do not understand why the market reacted this way I am hoping someone will give me some information or something to look over so I can learn and be better prepared in the future.

SatoriSlu;1521206282;84vcbx;;2;;4;"Greetings All,

I'll try to keep it short and sweet.  I recently inherited a TD Ameritrade Account which has $24,000 in cash.  I plan to use $20,000 of it for my masters degree, but would like to invest the other $4,000.  I've been reading John C. Bogle's ""Little book of common sense investing"".  So, I'd like to go the index fund route. I have two questions, keep in mind, I am 28 years old.


1) I want to allocate my investment into the following breakdown:

 
- 70% into a broad US based Index fund: FUSEX? VTSMX ?


- 10% into a foreign based Index Fund: FSIIX? VEA?


- 10% into a Cannabis based Fund: MJ (Alternative Harvest


- 10% into Bonds: FTBFX ? VCVSX ?



Question:  Given my goals(including the fact that I'd like to invest into this Cannabis based ETF), should I move my cash over to Fidelity or Vanguard?





2) Since the money in the TD Ameritrade account is all liquid, how difficult is it to transfer this account into a Fidelity or Vanguard account?  Is this even worth doing or should I just keep the money in TD Ameritrade and invest in these funds throw them?  I just don't want to pay unnecessary fee's if I can avoid it.

All 10 of these picks provide a yield of over 2% and I feel that for most cases you should strive for over 2% yield if your strategy is dividends. Anything below that is typically not worth it, unless a company is expected to raise dividends soon. You may be better off looking at some banks that offers GICs and such which usually guarantees a yield &lt; 2% if that's the route you want to go for less than 2% plays.

* So coming in at #10 is a drink everyone has heard of (and most likely tried before) - KO
-Coca Cola is one of Buffets long term holds, and its a solid company
-Provides stability and diversity in your portfolio
-KO provides a 3.02% yield

* In at #9 is one of the dominant players in semiconductors that is most likely powering your computer - INTC
-Strong company, stable growth and performance YoY
-They bring in a 2.31% yield which is impressive seeing as this company will probably keep growing in the near future

* #8 was the #1 performer in the DOW in 2017 up over 89% and providing an excellent dividend - and that's BA
-Aerospace company that again provides exposure to a different sector outside tech
-Brings in a dividend of 2.07%

* #7 is a company that is widely used, but not many people talk about - MMM
-If you've ever had to tape something, you've most likely used a 3M product
-This is a very underrated stock and it had an incredible 2017 as well
-3M gives us a 2.32% yield and is one of the safer plays out there as they are so dominant in their space

* Planning a home renovation? Chances are you will drop by a HD - which is my #6 pick
-ANother stock that had an incredibly 2017, and with home sales doing well, this will continue doing well
-HD gives us a 2.32% dividend

* #5 is a company I've talked about investing in before - JNJ
-They are big in the healthcare space, but my only concern right now is AMZN entering this space
-Nonetheless, they still provide a solid dividend at 2.54%

* Can I have fries with that? MCD is my #4 pick
-This is a stock I personally hold in my portfolio for the safety and dividends, but I also believe they will have good growth in 2018 and 2019
-They have made advancements using technology and apps to increase sales and I believe that will show in their profits and revenue
-MCD gives us a 2.55% dividend

* #3 is a company that typically partners with MCD, at least here in Canada, and was a top pick for 2018 by me - WMT
-The only true company IMO that can compete with AMZN
-They are making advancements with online shopping, and AMZN really needs a #2 competitor and I believe that is WMT
-WMT gives us a 2.37% dividend yield as well

* #2 is a company that profits from our garbage - WM
-Well run company with great growth
-They provide a 2.15% dividends

* Finally, #1 on the list is a company that continues to benefit from the strong economy - CAT
-Dominant player in their space, and I don't see that changing anytime soon
-Along with good growth, it gives us a 2.05% growth


Here's a summary:
1) CAT - 2.05%
2) WM - 2.15%
3) WMT - 2.37%
4) MCD - 2.55%
5) JNJ - 2.54%
6) HD - 2.32%
7) MMM - 2.32%
8) BA - 2.07%
9) INTC - 2.31%
10) KO - 3.02%


So that's my top 10. As a bonus, I included another stock - AAPL. They currently only pay a 1.41% yield, but investors are expecting this to go up significantly over the coming years as iPhone sales slow down. Apple's true future business isn't the iPhone - it's services and cloud - and as they rake in BILLIONS in profits here, they will most likely raise their dividend over the years.

So now I turn it over to you - what are some dividend plays that you think are a must-have in a portfolio? I know there are TONS of other's other there ($PFE, $VZ, etc.) so I'd like to see some discussion here.";225801;10 Dividend Picks for 2018;

So i figured a few months ago to work online. Plenty of slave labor work available online, but those won't cover my expenses (which i have minimized as much as realistically possible).

I opt into joining Nadex to trade forex (binaries/spreads) and after doing it for a few months, i feel that particular system isn't working for me (what you make is minuscule compare to how much you can lose). Basically, i am not comfortable in needing 2-4 wins to cover 1 lose. It's almost like gambling... and the odds are horrible.

I am wondering what are my options, with a small starting capital, when i'm looking at stocks, penny stocks, day trading, etc... There's a lot of information, and i did burn myself out after a few months of VERY intense research/work with Nadex and now i feel i am back at square 1 (or even square zero).

I guess i am looking for the next direction to take, but i do not know my options. Most brokers want $25,0000+, i can't do that.

From my research so far (only into it a few weeks for stocks/bonds/etc), it seems i need a LOT of starting capital to make any (decent) money. Is there really nothing available to someone with a few thousands and wants to grow it and then live off the profit? Nadex seemed like a good option, but the odds are rarely in my favors (i have taken the courses, practiced, practiced, practiced and then used the live account extensively).

gorillaz0e;1521459079;85irjf;;1;;4;"The financial media is drawn to catchphrases, acronyms, and buzzwords that can be sold as the new thing. FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) is the latest of these. But does this constitute an investment strategy?

For journalists, commentators, and marketers, acronyms like FAANG are useful. They fit easily into headlines and they appeal to a feeling among some investors that their portfolios should match the “zeitgeist” or spirit of the age.

But as we’ll see, investment trends tend to come and go. This is not to downplay the transformative nature of new technologies and the possibilities they present. But as an investor, it is wise to recall that all those hopes and expectations are already built into prices.

The FAANG acronym has become particularly popular in 2017 as returns from the five members of the unofficial club have far outpaced the wider market. Exhibit 1 shows the total year-to-date returns of the FAANG members compared to the S&amp;P 500:
https://services.ifa.com/art/images/1406_2017-12-4-10-38-47.png

Such is the public interest in the tech giants that the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange recently launched the NYSE FANG TM Index that includes the quarterly futures contracts of the FAANG members apart from Apple (hence only one “A”), plus another five actively traded technology growth stocks.

So, does this mean, as some media gurus suggest, that you should reweight your portfolio around these tech names? After all, these companies have fundamentally reshaped traditional sectors like newspapers, television, advertising, music, and retailing.

For investors, there are a few ways of answering that question, none of which involve denying the significant influence Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, and other technology names are having on our lives.

Firstly, market leadership is constantly changing based on a myriad of influences, including shifts in the structure of the global economy, commodities, technology, demographics, consumer tastes, and supply factors. Trying to build an investment strategy by anticipating these forces is like trying to catch lightning in a bottle.

In the 1960s, the then often-quoted Nifty Fifty of solid, buy-and-hold blue-chips included such names as Xerox, Eastman Kodak, IBM, and Polaroid, all of which were disrupted in one way or another by newer, more nimble competitors in the following decades.

By the late 1990s, the media was full of stories about the dot‑coms, companies that were building new businesses using the transformative power of the internet. A handful of those companies (Amazon, for instance) fulfilled their promise. Many others (retailer Boo.com, prototype social network TheGlobe.com, and pet supplies firm Pets.com were just three examples) crashed and burned.

In the mid-2000s, the focus turned to companies with a large exposure to the so-called BRIC economies, an acronym based on the fast-growing emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China.

Several financial services companies even set up BRIC products, with mixed degrees of success. One investment bank, having argued that the superior growth for emerging economies justified a bias to stocks exposed to these markets, ending up closing its BRIC fund in late 2015 after years of poor returns.1

So, while individual sectors each can have their time in the sun, it is not clear that weighting your portfolio toward an industry currently in favor is a sustainable long-term strategy.

A second way of looking at this issue is that accepting it is difficult to pick winning sectors does not mean you should exclude these zeitgeist stocks in a diversified marketwide portfolio. You can still own them, but you do so by casting a much wider net.

The more concentrated the portfolio, the more you are exposed to idiosyncratic forces related to individual stocks or sectors. Being highly diversified means you can still benefit from the broad trends driving technology or whatever is leading the market at any one time, but you are doing so in a more prudent manner.

Put another way, by diversifying you are not only reducing the risk of placing too much of a bet on one sector, you are improving the odds of holding the best performers. Look at Exhibit 2, which shows what would have happened if you had excluded the top 10% and top 25% of market performers in a global portfolio from 1994–2016.Exhibit 2:
https://services.ifa.com/art/images/1406_2017-12-4-10-38-55.png

We’ve seen that even professional investors can find it tough to pick which sector will lead the market from year to year.

It’s true that technology companies like Amazon and Facebook have performed well recently. But it is worth recalling that current prices already contain future expectations about those companies. We don’t know what future prices will be because these will reflect information we haven’t received yet. Because no one has a reliable crystal ball, a better approach is to diversify. That way we increase the odds of being positioned in the next big winning sector without chasing hot trends or latching on to cute‑sounding acronyms.";226145;Catchphrase Investing;

There is another aspect to Boustead...they were the lead underwriter for the private placement, the 10 million dollars that boustead used to acqurire service800 and likely a few other companies. 

If George, Boustead, and Maxim convince companies bringing in significantly more revenue than 10 million dollars to merge their company for a couple million up front, that likely means the companies see the great ability for growth.

I got around $50,000 I wont mind ""throwing"" over Amazon for the next few years, and I really think amazon could pull of atleast %15 annual returns, which might make the $50K to $141K, a pretty nice change, I will be in college at that time and wont need the money. Of course there is a chance of losing it, but as I already said I dont mind losing those $50,000 for a chance of making $141K in the course of my studies. Also, there is always the option amazon could magically go %20 or even %30 annualy which will make it $400K, It is very unlikely but I do trust miracles. 

I was thinking about making another investment for a really long time (around 20-30 years), on NVDA , MSFT , and maybe TSLA. 
What do you guys think? Nvidia will most likely explode since graphics increase all the time and the chance of losing is pretty small in my idea, even %3 annual can make $50K to $122K, and thats only with %3 annual intrest, which I predict is going to be around %6-%10 for NVDA.

NateStanley;1521588771;85xixo;;1;;2;"I had heard last week about a detailed fraud accusation involving Vuzix, by Mox Report. At first glance, it looks in-depth and professional to me, but the vernacular reads like a 100 level research project. On top of that, the link to the file is called ""$Short VUZI. Fraud""; the fact that they are giving financial advice in a LINK to a file also makes me question the validity. I could go on but it seems like a suspicious source. You can see their website below for a better idea. 

https://moxreports.com/all-articles/


A quick google search of "" Vuzix fraud"" returns 3 relevant results, 2 of which just mention that it was reported/tweeted by Mox report. The 3rd was a seeking alpha article.



Fast forward to today and 2 significant things happen:

1. A lawsuit was filed against Vuzix by a few different firms for misleading shareholders.

2. Vuzix announced 10 companies evaluating waveguide optics.

The timing of these 2 announcements complicates this more for me. Damage control? Poor timing? Idk. Either way the stock close at 6.95 (down 6.7%).

ScottyStellar;1521669614;8669ws;;2;;11;"Happy Interest Rate Hike Day to all, and welcome to the second weekly update on the Insider Track Portfolio.

It was a rough week for the market in general, as well as for the Insider Track stocks. The VTI from the time of last Wednesday's post was down 1.19%, beating the Insider Track which was down 1.52% or $39.45.

The good news is that we are still profitable, and still beating the VTI, giving back only $8.74- that's the amount we lost this week compared to if we had been in the VTI, so overall a small loss against our benchmark, and still up **$72.03** over the benchmark, or **2.88%**

[See the results and individual stocks here!](https://imgur.com/a/nGgN8)

Notable changes this week:

**3/15: Bought CRBP**. Dozens of insider buys over past few years, with some up to the $9 range, mostly $6-$7. Targeted under $7 and purchased at $6.85. 

**3/16: Bought BRS, WAAS, BRX**. 

* BRS- Two insider buys this month between $12.5-$13, with more insider buys over last couple years up to $15-16 range.

* WAAS- Stock declining but millions of dollars of insider purchases under $16 range, purchased at $13.2.

* BRX- Purchases last year up to $21, with recent purchases this year from $15-$15.5. Purchased at $15.24

**3/17: Sold KALA, SYRS**. Both had quick runs and were up above where the insiders had purchased lately, so I took quick profits to reinvest in others.

**3/19: Sold KFS, FGP, NURO**, upon further review did not look as strong as others, sold for new options.

**3/19: Bought NMFC, MTSC, INFU**

* NMFC- Lots of purchases and some options exercised, in $13-$14.2 range, purchased at $13.3

* MTSC- Some options plays and grants in $46-$54 range, purchased at $53.49, higher in range than I'd like but given the large value of investments by insiders, may be an ok play.

* INFU- Multiple insiders purchasing stock on its way up from the $1.8 range up to $2.4 most recently, looks like stock may be on a run up and insider expecting continued growth. Would've loved to get in the 1.8 range but taking a crack at $2.45 hoping for a continued run up.

The total gain on all sold stocks, including a quick $7 loss on CRVS due to mistaking my target price and purchasing far above target, comes to $34.83. Not bad for a quick turnover on some early stocks that I didn't do enough research on.

Now that I've reached my target of 25 stocks, I hope to be a bit more stable with the purchases/sales and not trading as frequently. Going to make sure I don't repeat past mistakes, and target stocks with large amounts of insider buys, preferably multiple purchasers, and target under the price of recent purchases, potentially missing some good ones but avoiding buying above where insiders are showing confidence.

Woru1989;1521724017;86bclb;;17;;0;"Hey All, the least that you can say is that AMZN is a trending ticket on this page. But I really don't see the value in this company at this moment. Why are people buying this? Can someone please explain it to me?! What am I missing here?

My analises is based on the EPS which are published on nasdaq.com (https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amzn/earnings-forecast). The most optimistic analyst predicts an EPS of 68.4 for 2021. Which is about a 1000% increase compared to last year eps. So yes, amzn's earnings will have a giant raise in the comming years. At current price levels they will have an forcasted PE ratio of 23 in 2021!!! 

How can amzn grow it's eps with 1000% in 4 years? And even if they can manage to grow that hard, it will still be very expensive in 2021. 

I think that 500 - 600 dollar range is a fair price for AMZN now. But propbably I'm crazy :-) ";226913;AMZN - Is everyone crazy our am I stupid?;

iknothing;1521736671;86cwmb;;10;;4;"President Donald Trump was set to sign an executive memorandum on Thursday that would impose about $50 billion in retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports.

The new measures are designed to penalize China for trade practices that the Trump administration says involve stealing American companies' intellectual property. They will primarily target certain products in the technology sector where China holds an advantage over the U.S.

The new measures follow a so-called 301 investigation led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer into China's potentially unfair trade practices with the U.S.

Lighthizer's office will publish a list of targeted products in 15 days, and there will be a 30-day period for public comment, according to senior administration officials.

The Trump administration had previously signaled that the tariffs would apply to at least $30 billion in Chinese imports, multiple news outlets reported. Trump himself has pushed for $60 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods.

In the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday before Trump's announcement, Lighthizer outlined the Chinese products that will be subject to the new tariffs, including aeronautics, modern rail, new energy vehicles and high-tech products.

Trump will consider further actions against China in two weeks, based on the effect of the first phase of the tariffs, CNBC reported Wednesday, citing sources. The president is reportedly concerned about the severity of the new measures' impact on American universities.

The Trump administration has regularly highlighted China's $375 billion surplus with the U.S. as evidence of an unfair trade relationship.

In an opening statement to the House Ways and Means Committee this week, Lighthizer said that long-term trade deficits ""to some extent reflect market distortions,"" and said they are ""having a negative effect on U.S. workers and businesses.""

The chairman of that committee, Texas Republican Kevin Brady, told CNBC on Thursday that the president should be cautious in his approach to new tariffs on Chinese goods.

""The challenge for every president is how to do it in a way that doesn't punish Americans for China's misbehavior,"" Brady said. ""So, you've really got to narrow these and target these. It is a very discerning line to do that.""

China's foreign ministry argued on Thursday that it should not be punished if it doesn't want to buy what the U.S. is selling.

Lighthizer also suggested that the U.S. may take action against the World Trade Organization for its failures on promoting a fairer trade landscape. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Trump administration is weighing the possibility of a lawsuit against the WTO policies that cover Chinese trade.

The new trade restrictions exacerbate fears of sparking a global trade war that were raised after Trump signed executive orders enacting broad tariffs on steel and aluminum on March 8.";226952;Trump to slap China with $50 billion in tariffs over intellectual property theft;

The question is, what are we going to do to confront the uncertainty market?

Some analysts still recommend concentrating on the stock market, even if there might be less earning this year. Due to inflationary pressures and higher interest rates, the market will be up somewhat less than earnings. Traders may want to avoid high-flying growth stocks and focus on value names.

In the last 2 years since finishing uni and starting my career I have become incredibly interested in all aspects of Investing. I’m the black sheep of my family as none of my relatives are in any way involved in finance or investing, also my career is in engineering/sales, so completely unrelated.

JumboNate;1521825730;86meeq;Discussion;17;;10;"NOTE: I am NOT an expert.

After conducting very basic research over the last few hours, I've somewhat noticed that corrections within the DOW only seem to last anywhere from one to three months with a ~1,000 to 2,500 point drop, peak to trough. Each correction is typically a higher point value drop as the market grows relatively over time. (Think percentage wise!)

After a few quick Google searches of ""DOW (month) (year)"", it is very apparent that global economies, specifically China, are the main source of investor concern. What's happening now just seems normal to me, right? On the other hand, I looked into the beginnings of crashes and bear markets, and the news correlating to those are much more drastic and more well-known to be an issue to the general public. For example, housing crash, oil price volatility mostly as a result of political turmoil and war, and even ebola!

I am no politician, but I don't see the two leaders of these countries starting a brutal trade war that would lead either market into such nerve-wracking conditions.

TLDR: I think we'll be fine by the end of April, assuming Trump doesn't do any more crazy stuff.

nathanj37;1521859549;86qbu2;;20;;23;"Background: I mostly lurk round these parts but occasionally post regarding biotech plays, mostly my own. 

$ARNA is a small-cap biotech play that fell apart after licensing its lead drug to another company to sell and develop and turning back to its pipeline candidates -- not something a drug company typically does, and its stock fell nearly 90% off its 2012 highs as a result. Despite the strange narrative of Cincinnatus returning to his plow, there's a compelling reason to think that $ARNA is poised to be one of the biggest rebuilding stories of the next three years.

1. Ralinepeg is a best-in-class treatment for Pulmonary Artery Hypertension, entering Phase III trials in the 2nd half of 2018. JNJ has an inferior compound which it valued at *$8 billion* when it acquired Actelion. Ralinepeg also has Orphan Drug Status, which increases the likelihood of FDA approval and may speed the review process.

2. Etrasimod is a potential best-in-class treatment for Ulcerative Colitis, and has a plurality of other ""bonus"" indications in Phase II trials. Celgene purchased Ozanimod from Receptos for *$7.2 billion,* but Etrasimod does not appear to have the safety issues that may complicate Ozanimod's trials.

3. There are a number of other early-stage $ARNA prospects that could have significant value, but they are not yet through Phase II and hard to appraise.

4. If you were to just value Etrasimod and Ralinepeg at the same value as their competitors, and do not consider the additional value from their superior pharmacokinetics, safety profile, additional indications, you would value $ARNA at a market cap of at least *$15.2 billion.* This also does not take into account Belviq or other pipeline compounds.

5. The compelling case for $ARNA is that it currently trades at a Market Cap of $1.62 billion. As speculative as biotech plays may be, $ARNA smacks of being an enterprise that as time winds on could prove to be trading at a fraction of its intrinsic value.

Im always open to constructive criticism, and suggestions, so don't be afraid to mention anything either with these diaries or with my habits. 

**The Story**

I started my trading making a pact. This pact is to put at least 100$ a week in my account to assist with growing my portfolio. I started with 100$, growing to 200$ in my first/second weeks, both detailed here. I went hard into CVEO to start, a natural gas/oil habitation on site habitation provider. With the pipelines going down in central US, I figured they were a good start. Their graphs showed a relatively stable, but slowly rising uptrend over the last 3 months. After depositing the other 100, I split my money into GERN (Before the takeoff, but I made a mistake! More on that later), NVCN, and MBII. MBII showed promise, but has been also shown unwilling to move. I sold out my MBII and CVEO after GERN spiked to go all in on GERN. I pulled out of GERN at 6.20 for a hefty profit for what I had in. However a tingle of greed came about me, and I went back in anticipating it to go back up. It did not, and started to drop, so I sold to mitigate losses. It wasn't until after this situation that I realized that this entire exchange was a mess of me not knowing what I was doing, before I made the distinction to, again, go back in. I picked a good downpoint, and went back in after sacrificing at the time what was 20$ worth of profit on 2 terrible whims. I went back in at 6.03, up from where I sold in a panic, ultimately costing me money. The only good side to this is that with what I had in CVEO and MBII, I how have a solid share base in GERN, which I will attempt to ride out. As for NVCN, well, they've been showing losses for almost every day both weeks. Turns out to have been a bad investment, but at 11 cents a share, and me having only invested 7$ in it, im willing to ride it out and see what happens, and I wont cry if the price crashes and I lose the price of 2 cups of coffee and a few doughnuts. 

I ended Friday with 229.53. Just shy of a 15% rise in profit. To me, despite my serious blunder, I would say that's productive.

**The Lessons**

* Don't be so quick to pull out of a stock just because youll make a profit/lose some profit

* Make sure youre ready to pull out completely if youre going to pull out. Don't play hot and cold with your stocks, unless youre a day trader who knows what their doing.

* Penny stocks kind of suck

**Speculations**

I really feel like the Facebook thing is going to blow over. If I had the kind of capital needed, I would buy into it hard. Social media is to much a part of peoples lives for them to completely cut it out, and considering the whole thing appears to have not even really been facebook's fault, they have deniability.

As for GERN, I really want to buy into them as much as possible. I predict that J&amp;J(Their funding company) will definitely bank roll them another year, and once they get greenlit, and the money flows (and it will, because of COURSE J&amp;J wants some of that delicious, cutting edge blood cancer cure) their stock price is going to hike again. Ill be there, waiting!

*Investment bank values this Permian Basin play at~ $16 a share which is small part of their bigger picture and leaves the rest of their operations undervalued. They are finding new oil deposits in other areas recently as today. 

*Production has potential to ramp up to 10 fold in the next 5 years for the Permian Basin play and 35% overall for the company. 

*US Oil prices are consistently rising and it looks to be a continuing trend through the year 

*Sold off bad investments in 2017 to allow more capital towards infrastructure and production in more profitable areas

*Recent drops related to market corrections and one article mentions a 3rd party pipeline malfunction affecting production last year

*High 2.8% dividend

So what to do?

With IPOs this is actually one of the easiest decisions in stock trading. Simply note the high price and the low price on day one of the IPO. Those are the lines in the sand.

Buy on a close above the high of the first with a stop loss below the high of the first day. With DBX that buy is a close above 31.60. If the stock drops back below that number, take the loss (likely small) and forego the anxiety of being locked into a foolish IPO buy made on whatever day.

&gt;Investors in German equities have had an unpleasant surprise this year: a traditional strength of the market has become a liability.

&gt;The global footprint of companies on the benchmark Dax index has turned it into something of a ground zero as money managers are forced to reckon with the implications of an escalating trade war. Home to companies including BASF, Adidas and Siemens, the Dax has tumbled 11 per cent since late January, making it a laggard in what has been a testing first quarter for global equities.

&gt;“The debate about protectionism is making investors feel queasy with regard to German stocks,” said Joachim Schallmayer, head of equities and strategy at Deka, a Frankfurt-based asset manager, adding that the time when German blue-chips were the big winners of globalisation seems to be gone.

jchang23;1522150661;87hoy8;;13;;15;"A big driver for many social media stocks is MAU's (Monthly Active Users) and activity. 

Years ago investors figured out that a website that makes money mostly off ads can have many registered users but it does not mean they are active. 

Many are anticipating a big drop in Facebooks monthly active user number because of the privacy issues and the #DeleteFacebook trending hashtag. 

However, Deleting Facebook is not that easy for people. Besides the addiction aspects of it, many users use their FB login to access others sites and apps.

Furthermore, what about the people who logged into facebook that have not logged in for a long time just to see how many of their friends are gone? Aren't they now an active user for the next report?

What about people who logged in to FB and intended to delete it but never actually did? Once again, there go more active users. 

I would be concerned to short FB leading up to the next report as I fear a black swan event like this. I would be way more open to shorting it leading up to the third qtr report when we can starting see more accurate MAU numbers and activity.

1) Nvidia
-Number 1 is one of my new favorite companies - Nvidia! These guys are just a profit machine and growth machine and they keep posting outstanding numbers and show no signs of slowing down. The last month or so as the market has been a bit weak and volatile, NVDA has kind stood its ground. Everytime it sells off, buyers come back in to push it higher and this stock is really outperforming the market right now, and is showing similar strength as AMZN and NFLX as well. In march, we had 2 analysts come out and reiterate their view on NVDA
	-Argus	Buy	$250 → $280
	-RBC Capital Mkts	Outperform	$280 → $285
Both have targets that are a lot higher than the current share price and it's clear analysts are also very bullish on NVDA's future. Looking @ the technicals, we can see that NVDA is really holding above all its MA's well. Everytime we come down to the support level, people have the BTD mentality and then push it higher. We can see its making higher lows, but is finding resistance at around the $250 level. We need one of three things to happen to push this higher:
1) good news about the company - maybe a raised guidance for the upcoming QoQ
2) good news in the sector - Micron for example reports earnings this month and if they show strength, investors will believe NVDA will as well
3) market needs to move higher - NVDA follows the market, like any stock, to some extent
If we have a big rally in the market, we'll see NVDA make new ATHs IMO


2) Facebook
If you don't know my current stance on FB - I believe all of this negative news right now will blow over in a few months. Once next earnings come around, investors will remember why they love FB - because of their huge reach and huge profits. This is a stock I personally hold in my long term portfolio, and it's a company that just keeps growing. They own FB, Insta, and Whatsapp, and they have over 2B users on these platforms. Celebs are switching from Snap to Insta, which is where I think FB will be seeing a lot of $ coming in from. The selloff imo was unwarranted - I gave my reasoning in a different post I made recently. I believe FB will recover this year - but April in a great time to scoop up more shares in this company. It might be a slower recovery than we're used to, but as long as their earnings and growth continue, it should be back to ATH this year. In march, they had a hold rating by Stifel reiterated with a $168 price target. Nothing significant IMO. From a technical standpoint if we jump to the charts, FB is around its 200 day MA now and typically stocks stay at this level for a little while as they test it. I don't think FB will be any different. To move higher and past it, we'll need some good news to come out. I think Earnings can be that good news and they are scheduled to report May 2 - and I think we'll see a run up to Earnings in April. I'm watching the $145 level for support, but we did get pretty close to that yesterday with a successful gapfill.

	

3) Home Depot
-HD - of course a home improvement store, the largest in this space in North America - and their only true competitor is Lowes - who is far behind. Morgan Stanley said the recent weakness has created a ""compelling entry point"" for investors. Now, you shouldn't believe what these Analysts say, but you should pay attention to the general sentiment. Nothing has fundamentally changed in HD and they are still strong, and MS recognizes that. There are fears out there that interest rate hikes may affect home sales and renovation sales - but this is something we'll have to wait and see about. We did have hikes in the past, and home sales just kept rising QoQ, so if the last few years tells us anything, it's that people want to buy houses! In march, Loop Capital initiated coverage on HD with a HOLD rating but no price target set
-as for the technicals, if we jump to the charts, we can see that HD is moving sideways for the most part recently, still above its 200 day MA. I believe we will most likely dip down to test this before we move higher and this would be healthy for the stock. It's kind of fallen back in a range it was in 2017, so we could test the lower bound of this range at around $168 if we see weakness in the market. That would ideally be my entry point for HD if I was looking to play this

jchang23;1522218315;87ppgj;;19;;19;"I remember in my early days of trading I often wondered if I can sell a service that alerts investors to what stock I purchased. If only they did the opposite, they certainly would make money quickly.

Another service I felt I can sell, is getting paid to sell my shares in a given stock. I had enough documented proof to show, that the minute I sell my shares, the stock rises.

The obvious reason why it feels like the minute we buy a stock it goes down, is simply because we watch it more. In many cases the moves the stock is making are similar to the moves they made before you purchased, however, now that you are invested in it, you notice it more. 

When we get out of a stock we watch is less, so there is a chance that the next time we notice a move it will be a big jump (up or down) but in reality it was a bunch of small jumps that just appear big because you didn't check it so often.

The lesson is that if you did your homework and purchased a stock for the long term or semi long term, sometimes it's best to not check on it too often. The sometimes irrational emotional side that is part of us humans, causes us to invest in a way that is not always beneficial to our financial stability.

ScottyStellar;1522329550;8816t6;;2;;0;"Another rough week for many of us, and for the markets in general, with the VTI dropping from my last post from $139.93 down to $133.88 as of my recording last night.

It was a better week for the Insider Track however, still losing money overall, but beating the VTI this week by **$85.54**

[See the results here](https://imgur.com/a/kHXe6)

We are now in just three weeks beating the VTI by **6.18%** or **$154.45**, while maintaining profit of just **$24.85** on the original investment, or just a dash under 1% gain during a tumultuous few weeks. Perhaps there is something to this Insider thing after all, but the real challenge will come when the market rises- can we beat that pace?

**Weekly Sold Stocks:**

Sold BOMN. Got lucky on this one, it was my top earning stock as of the night of 3/25, so I sold with a stop limit of $26 on the morning of the 26th, and got lucky with a sale price at the peak of $26.29 before it dropped down to the low 20s.

Sold GE. This one had been weighing on the portfolio, no insider buys in a couple months, and seems like it might be a longer term play, with a lot of controversy. Took the loss.

**Weekly Buys:**

Bought ZYNE at $8.9/share, lots of insider buys up in the high teens before recent big drops, and more purchases around $9/share lead me to believe the Insiders feel it dropped more than it should.

Bought TCON at $2.3/share after seeing multiple insiders buying at $2.7/share, which looks like it's in line with a stock offering or options. While I usually avoid options/offerings, seeing large insider investments at that rate, and my ability to get in more than 10% below their purchase price looks too good to pass up.

**Overall** A solid week for us, losing a bit of money but hanging on better than the market in general. Starting to feel a bit more confident about this idea, though it is still early on and a weird time in the market.

We've taken some dividends as well, a whopping $2.25 overall, and a couple more on the way.

I don't want to expose myself to a large amount of risk while I am learning so I'm trying to start with small amounts. I'm also trying to figure out call spreads as they seem much ""safer"" than regular calls. 



Here is an example of one I'm looking at.

https://imgur.com/a/lWRCh

If I buy a $95 WMT call set to expire June 15 for $128

And I sell a 97.5 WMT call Expiring on the same date for an $83 credit.

This cuts my max loss down to $45 correct? (the difference between the two) 

It would also cap my max gains at $45 or 100% right?

So if I have this right by doing these call spreads I'm lowering my break even point, lowering my max losses, but limiting my max gains. Most importantly this would limit or get rid of time decay also?

If on a day of good news Walmart jumped up 5% and I was up $22 or about 50% on this bet would I be able to sell the option contracts immediately before the expiration date and take my profits? 

Does this look/sound right? Is there anything that I'm missing?

Long time stock holder, but new to making moves with my Dividends and holdings.  I've shifted some of my long term stocks (employer/employee contributions), to FB recently and a couple of little stocks, for some long term.  I've just started to really focus on what to look for in the market and the lingo thrown around here and WSB.  What I cant entirely wrap my mind around is, Options.  

I understand conceptually the call and put and the buy and sell, but what I'm not entirely sure of is whether or not you actually have to own the stock, or if your'e gambling when doing a naked call?  Are contracts only traded in 100's?  So if I buy a facebook call, I'd be looking at $16K to buy the stock, or lose my contract?

If I were to buy a call for FB as an example, can I sell my call without ever closing the deal on my buy?  Like am I just passing the call to the new buyer?  How does it work in laymen terms?

Im not looking to trade options right now for the record.  I just assumed that I invest in companies, see the stocks go up and down, sometimes get dividends, and thats it.

I used to have Scottrade, which was recently acquired by TDAmeritrade, and my account has been transferred over.

When I had scottrade, if I make an ACH deposit through a linked account, within 10 minutes the funds were almost immediately available for trading without delay. I couldn't withdraw the funds or cash it out since it hasn't settled, but I could use the funds to trade it.

With TD Amerritrade, this doesn't seem to be the case.
My other bank account is linked to Ameritrade. Despite having made an ACH deposit well before the supposed cut-off of 4pm (11am), the funds are still not available for trading now, which is well past the cut-off (6:44pm).

The bank I'm using to fund Ameritrade is the exact same account as the one I used to use to fund Scottrade - which is Discover, so I don't think the difference is with how fast Discover is processing it.

So is this just how it is with Ameritrade? The funds are never available for immediate trading? Or maybe it's just because ACH is clogged and today was an unusual delay..? Please let me know.

If this is just how Ameritrade is, can someone please recommend a brokerage with low trading fees but quick-clearance/fund-availability like it used to be with Scottrade?

Doesn't this fail to account for the decrease in cash on the company's balance sheet? Does this hold true for regular cash dividends as well? For example, if a company has been paying a $0.20 dividend for years and there's no expectation that will change any time soon, would that be priced into the stock, meaning no increase at announcement?

Currently I'm still in process of thinking, if it's right time or not to buy stocks.

I understand that an index like the S&amp;P tracks the prices of the companies that make up the index and that it is computed by weighted average market capitalization. Index funds (SPY for example) then track the S&amp;P500. 

If a company goes up in value (AAPL for example), then the S&amp;P will go up and then SPY fund will go up - all proportionally (ignoring for the moment fees/friction/etc.).

Funds like SPY are also subject to high frequency trading and shorting.

1) EXPR's intrinsic value is $13.07 per share (Currently trading at a 49% discount to its intrinsic value).

2) Expected Annual Earnings Growth = 34%

3) EXPR has $236 million in cash on its balance sheet with $0 debt.

4) The average 12 month analyst price target = $9.90 per share.

5) Forward P/E is a low 12.66

6) Quarterly Earnings growth = 29%

7) Book Value = $8.35 per share. It's trading at only 80% of its book value.

8) Extraordinarily high probability of being taken private. It would be accretive to the acquirer (rare in retail).

9) Operating Cash Flow positive by $188.5 million.

10) Levered Free Cash Flow by $64.6 million

An additional pending bonus via accretion to current shareholders is the company's willingness to buyback up to $145 million worth of its stock which would roughly retire close to 25% of its outstanding shares.

I know the progression-free survival on both Incyte's and NewLink's drugs from the phase 2 data are not much better than Bristol's currently marketed Opdivo/Yervoy drug combination for melanoma, but it seems like if Incyte's ECHO-301 reports greater then 14 months of progression-free survival, then both Incyte's and NewLink's stock prices could rise 40% and 100% respectively.

ECHO-Respect;1522822953;89n1ku;;3;;3;"&gt;This is going to be a neat little Trader's Diary for me. It will basically be my week in review, detailing positions I've taken, money I've made, and lessons I've learned. This will also allow me to write down the things I've done to further analyze my actions in a better light, while also opening myself up to help others avoid my mistakes, learn from my lessons, and allow other, much more experienced traders to teach me. Im always open to constructive criticism, and suggestions, so don't be afraid to mention anything either with these diaries or with my habits. 

**The Story** 

This week was kind of grim. I pulled into it with 300 banked, and feeling sky high, leaving my portfolio worth almost 340, and an additional 100 later in the week on an AKER buy. Holding neovasc, GERN, and late in the week, AKER, I felt I was in a pretty good position. Neovasc, of course, I never had high hopes for. Im holding onto it as a ""wait and see"" stock, since it costed me 15$ to go in on them. Not enough for me to care how they do. They have interesting ideas that would be nice to be able to cash out on, but given their recent news, I doubt much will come of them with threats of delisting. GERN, on the other hand, my darling stock, and the gift that keeps on giving after last week's blunder, gave me another harsh lesson. However, in the aftermath, I learned quite a few things that might be critical to my future as a trader. All in all, what I lost in money on GERN, I gained in knowledge, which might just be worth more. GERN dropped, hard. It never did spike again, and in fact dropped more. Down to $4, actually, leaving me with a loss of between 1.50-2$ a share, and also deleting my previous profit. In my effort to restore my blunder last week, I held GERN and I really shouldn't have, expecting it to spike again, essentially making the same mistake of a different nature twice in a row. Between that, and going in on AKER on the behest of a gentleman with a convincing argument as to why they would do really well (They were expecting REALLY good news Tuesday, and FDA approval for a massive development.) come to find out that the FDA approval never came, and they reported dismal returns further causing damage. I bought in expecting good profit come yesterday, only to take a huge smack and lose between GERN and AKER, 85$. This leaves my portfolio at 314.45. Bad, losses, estimating a 20% loss. 

**The Lessons**

* The opposite of a lesson from last week. Where last week I noted that its important to know when to keep a stock, I posit today that I now know how important it is to cut your losses. 

* I learned a lot about market swings, and breakouts. I wish I would have had this knowledge moving into GERN, but better late than never. For those seeking, or unknowing, familiarize yourself with the terms *""Breakout""* and *""False Breakout""*

* Among familiarizing myself with these terms, Ive also learned a lot about day trading, and patterns, along with how to read some charts (admittedly, I didn't know WTF a candlechart was) and a few prediction methods.

* RHOOD's GRAPHS SUCK. Moving to finviz to find stocks, and ThinkOrSwim for analysis. I want to try tradestation for their analytics, but they are NOT friendly with startup traders. You need a lot of capital before they'll even shake your hand.

**Speculations**

Facebook rose up a bit, and then dropped back to 155. I still anticipate the damage being reversible, especially with them playing damage control as hard as they are right now. I still believe that they will rise from the ashes, though I have no money staked on it. Knowing what I know now, about breakouts and chart reading, I wouldn't dare touch them, despite my belief. 

In an effort to correct my previous mistakes, my plan is to sell the entire portfolio, and start again. I have my eyes on AKG, and maybe going back into CVEO since I regret pulling out. They have a nice trend, and have only gone up. I might try to pull a few Day Trades on OPTT, which has a really predictable fluxuation pattern.

Once data is in the excel file, you can do all sorts of fancy reporting. Just wanted to let people know.     
use the ""=googlefinance()"" function in google spreadsheets online and connect your local excel file to the online sheet by publishing data online.    
edit 1:      
Step 1: Go online to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets and open a new spreadsheet    
Step 2: Create a table with ticker symbols you are interested in.     
Step 3: Use the formulae ""=GOOGLEFINANCE(D2,""price"")"" in one of the cell where cell D2 will have your ticker symbol.      
Step 4: The resultant formula will give your current price for that ticker in cell D2.     
Step 5: Play around the formulae to get more info for eg:     
=INDEX(GOOGLEFINANCE(D2,""price"",today()-5),2,2) gives you closing price 5 days ago     
Step 6: =GOOGLEFINANCE(D2,""high52"") will provide you with 52 high data while =GOOGLEFINANCE(D2,""low52"") will provide 52 week low data for that particular ticker.     
Step 7: Once the table is created, go to File-&gt; Publish to the web...     
Step 8: A window will appear ,where you will copy the link.     
Step 9: Open an excel in your computer. Go to Data -&gt; From web and paste that link from step 8.     
STep 10: wallah now you got your numbers in the excel file getting updated from the web.

ScottyStellar;1522879912;89u3ry;;0;;7;"Over the past week (frankly, mostly today), the market held its ground and finally bounced upwards in the last couple hours of trading today. I'm happy to say the Insider Track has once again outperformed its benchmark, through a very volatile period in the market.

The VTI was back up to $135.79 up from the close in the 133s last week, up **1.43%** over that period, while the Insider Track put up a weekly gain of **2.07%** or, in my preferred way to analyze the challenge, a **$16.19** increase over where an investment in the VTI would have landed.

[See the Week 4 results here](https://imgur.com/a/kKaOz)

After the first four weeks of the project, the Insider Track has earned **$77.06** on the initial $2500 investment, or a **3.08%** growth, while the VTI has lost **3.83%**. This leaves us with a gain over the VTI of **6.91%** or **$172.85** over the first month!

**Weekly Changes:**

**Sold** INFU on 4/2 at $2.85/share, netting $17.60 or a 16.33% profit.

**Sold** BGFV today 4/4 at $7.2/share, netting $12.80 or a 12.5% profit.

**Bought** COGT on 4/2. Lots of insider purchases over the past year, and in 2018 alone 4 separate purchases of over $100K, with three of those being over $200K. Lots of confidence around the $2.50-$3 range from insiders.

**Bought** IFF today 4/4. There was a small insider sale this year at $141/share but over $20M in purchases between $134-135. Unfortunately I got in a little above 135, but comfortable with that due to the volume of insider purchasing. This is a bit overbalanced in the portfolio since I'm still targeting around $95-105 as the total entry value, but I want to keep this realistic and not get hypothetical with fractions of shares.

Full disclosure, I did not actually purchase the IFF shares in my personal portfolio, as I decided to grab a share of SHOP instead, but I did verify the price it was going for on multiple sites- I will never backdate a purchase or pick a lower entry-point, and all decisions/purchases will be made and added in real time with current market data.";229741;ScottyStellar's Insider Track- Week 4 Update- One month down, another week up!;

The building achieves and surpasses [LEED® Platinum Certification](https://new.usgbc.org/leed) from the [U.S. Green Building Council](https://new.usgbc.org/).

3. established a Joint Venture with [Scottish Government](http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/03/20/1442496/0/en/SHARC-Energy-Systems-UK-and-Scottish-Water-Horizons-Launch-JV-to-Support-Green-Energy-Agenda.html) called Bandwith (YouTube: watch?v=UM5LChtLBZA), ""which has created a $36.8 million CAD pipeline of potential installations across Scotland"".

[Meriton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meriton) has 15k(!) apartments in development pipeline and their projects equate to ~0.05 % of Australia’s GDP.

6. CEO [Lynn Mueller](http://www.sharcenergy.com/?team=lynn-mueller) has over 25 years of experience in geothermal heat pump sales and used to be president of [WaterFurnace](https://www.waterfurnace.com/).

The company also has several other projects in the [pipeline](https://www.worldwatertechnorthamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lynn-Mueller-SHARC-Energy-Systems.pdf):

1. a [joint venture in California](http://www.sharcenergy.com/us60-million-financing-commitment-1000-iws-systems-california/) with ""funding of $60 Mio. USD over five years"" and production expected in Q1 2018. So, probably sooner than later now...

2. working with [BC Hydro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Hydro) to implement Sharc systems in educational institutes. Probably in British Columbia as BC Hydro is owned by the government of British Columbia.

3. Several sites in Australia were identified for Sharc and Piranha systems and are in planning stages.

4. Planning stages for district heating opportunities in Richmond, Ottawa, Chicago and Los Angeles.

predictionmonk;1522982563;8a60uq;;1;;0;"I built an AI-lite model to predict the daily price performance of the QQQ (tracking Nasdaq-100). It should work about two-thirds of the time.  
Feel free to check the performance tomorrow and let me know your thoughts.

Today displayed the pattern predicted a day ago. All predicted ranges were struck!!!
https://twitter.com/predictionmonk/status/981988197763706880

&amp;nbsp;

price prediction (QQQ) for tomorrow (April 6, 2018): the forecast is again complex, and what is worse, complicated by the lobotomy-in-chief's declaration of new tariffs against China. This forecast was produced before those news came out, so I will provide a conservative estimate of their effect on the prediction.

Tomorrow is slightly unlikely to open flat, with no clear indication as to initial bullishness or bearishness. The primary model is straight-up uncertain about it, while the secondary slightly hints at a non-flat open.

As to the market high, the primary model expects it to be about $3 higher or lower than today's close of 160.65. The secondary model is more assertive, saying that the high itself will be in bearish territory. So, the high is currently predicted to be either slightly bullish to plain bearish. Note this suggests that it is unlikely to see any extended drive into positive territory.

The picture, however, is the opposite for the lows: the primary expects a flat-to-slightly-bearish low, while the secondary expects a bullish low. This can mean a low that straddles the flat line, and may end positive.

Finally, as to the close, the primary model seriously does not expect a flat close, with high probability (.8). The secondary is uncertain.

This forecast is admittedly complex, and offers a murky picture. It fits with a possible flat market with zig-zags throughout the day. The flatness is suggested by the lower high predicted, coupled with the higher low predicted. At any rate, we can discount some scenarios. It will be unlikely to see a day that is markedly in one direction, either bullish or bearish.

Amidst this complexity, we have the threats of further trade war - which dropped the QQQ in the afterhours. I can only guess here, because the model did not run using the afterhours figures. By 8pm EST, the QQQ was around 158.63, which still places it within the predicted bounds for tomorrow. So, it seems that the trade war happenings will not completely undo the behavior predicted for tomorrow. On the other hand, a simple guess is that whatever zig-zags were to occur tomorrow, will simply happen a few points lower during the day. It's as if we shifted the whole market behavior downwards for the day. I admit this is a simple guess, and perhaps the fears will interact more directly with the market - but the controlled drop in the afterhours suggests to me that tomorrow will not be a freefall.


(! indicates ""not the case that..."")

open:	!(160.15-161.15)
high:	&lt;157.54-163.22
low:	157.93-160.65+
close:	!(160.15-161.15)

(Keep in mind today's close was 160.65)

Note: the ranges above may occasionally show some incoherence. For example, the open range may sometimes be higher than the high range. In those cases, I interpret the highs to apply after the open itself. (A similar thing applies to closing-price ranges). You should still be able to draw a general picture from looking at all the ranges in conjunction.

VRgamer84;1523025451;8aa0lb;;8;;2;"I have a very STRICT day trading strategy. I have 50k of my own money but with 4:1 margin, 200k in day trading buying power. My STRICT rule is the second I am at a $1000 loss on the trade, I am OUT, period. Literally as soon as I buy the stock, I IMMEDIATLEY put in a stop order equal to $1000 loss so I am assured of exiting the trade and taking emotions out of it. (For stocks that I short, I just create alerts since a stop buy order would get filled right away)

Anyway, this week (yesterday actually) I made a 4 grand profit.. I shorted 1000 FB for $2300 profit, shorted 1500 shares of MSFT for $700 profit and bought 3000 shares of INTC for $1000 profit. All this yesterday. All those stocks are normal “slower volatility.” Well today I thought I would short NFLX, took maybe 30 seconds and my $1000 loss limit was reached and closed for a loss.

I know the general rule when it comes to day trading is more volatility is better, BUT if you employ a very strict risk management system that I employ, it seems like you will just hit your stop loss a lot faster the higher volatility the stock is. Oh and I utilize $180,000 worth of my buying power on every trade, since I have a good exit strategy, I am ok with using a ton of margin.

Bottom line is it seems like day trading the more “boring” less volatile stocks are much better for sustained success.";230066;Contrarian view on day trading.. Lower volatile stocks are actually BETTER to day trade for sustained success than higher V stocks.. Thoughts?;

-Attractive dividend @ 6.48% (although high dividend common in the RE industry)

The reason I ask is because I plan on starting development on an app that takes anywhere between 50-150 of the most common technical indicators and lets the user know whether it's a buy (or a sell) and in which time frame (day/positional/swing/long-term).

My thought process behind this is that while a few indicators are good, I believe firmly from a technical standpoint that the more indicators favor your trade, the better chances you have of profiting. It would be nice to get a visual of say 70-80% of 100 indicators saying it's a good time to buy (for a certain time frame) rather than just the 5-7 that I would typically use.

This also begs the question whether traders would have a use for this regularly and whether you would pay subscription costs for this type of service.

MapleSyrup2911;1523302425;8b19iw;;2;;12;"Hi /r/stocks,

I started investing half a year ago and all in all I'm pretty fresh with investment topic. I made a small (simple) portfolio consisting of index ETFs and I invest in on monthly basis. My current portfolio looks like this:

Emerging markets - 20% https://www.justetf.com/de-en/etf-profile.html?isin=FR0010959676
Euro STOXX 600 - 20% https://www.justetf.com/de-en/etf-profile.html?isin=LU0908500753
MSCI WORLD - 60% https://www.justetf.com/de-en/etf-profile.html?isin=FR0010315770

So this MSCI WORLD ETF when i opened its factsheet (https://www.justetf.com/servlet/download?isin=FR0010315770&amp;documentType=MR&amp;country=DE&amp;lang=de) it clearly shows 50%+ coverage of U.S. but apparently when I checked on my bank account and some other information it shows that its covering Europe over 70% with 0% on U.S.? Am I seeing something wrong here or i made ""lucky"" mistake because apparently this one is doing almost the best out of MSCI World ETFs in last 6 months?

If I indeed made a mistake and my portfolio is not covering U.S. do you suggest that i transfer my money from this one to one that acutally covers U.S. or keep going as it is?

Sorry for asking beginner questions and thanks for answers in advance.

YabukiJoe;1523318090;8b37ij;Discussion;27;;1;"I invested with Disney in early 2015 when it was around $106/share, because I thought The Force Awakens would mean something stock-wise. Now, over three years later, it's floating around both sides of $100, the newest mainline Star Wars movie wasn't without controversy, the toys aren't selling, and Disney has utterly failed to fully capitalize on the videogame potential of their IPs. 

I mean, giving the rights to make new Star Wars games to a single publisher? Are you insane? With all the potential Star Wars has already demonstrated across multiple genres? We had racing games, multiple flight combat games, and now what? Two milquetoast FPSes and mobile trash? When it comes to videogames, Star Wars is like SEARS in the age of Amazon - pathetically behind. As an avid gamer and investor, for me to say this is unacceptable is an understatement. Sad! 

And that's before we start getting to crap like ESPN, and the fact they're so stubborn on holding onto sports league licenses, that when people drop cable (and ESPN with it), they *raise* the price to recoup the costs of the licensing, instead of lowering it to try appealing to the customers with tighter wallets. It's a violation of basic economic sense - supply and demand! Why don't they just cut the licenses?

Has Bob Iger even been good for Disney? When he getting ousted?

nastynate14597;1523364106;8b7ayh;;2;;2;"I bought into a pharmaceutical company (Antibe) after reading through their latest press release comparing their phase 2B results to other NSAIDS. The company has stated they will be looking to partner with a buyer to complete their research process. They recently decided to proceed to the next research phase with their own cash. 

My question is, would you consider their decision to use their own cash as a sign of faith in their product? I would assume that a company that has lost faith in its product wouldn't drain cash on research, and would instead distribute the cash to its main owners before failure.

FuninUSA;1523373019;8b89kk;;0;;1;"Tuesday this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered an address from the Boao Forum for Asia, an annual summit that's been dubbed the ""Asian Davos,” reported by FuninUSA.

Xi's address comes amid escalating trade tensions between China and the US as the world's two largest economies take turns announcing punitive trade measures against each other.  (Details on Chinese and US measures are reported in previous FuninUSA news)

There’re basically several points that Xi was trying to emphasize during his speech:
1)  China does not seek trade surplus and will ""work hard"" to import products that are required by the population.
2)  Xi sold a vision of China as a benevolent leader of the global economy, emphasizing that open systems are the best course of action for the world.
3)  Xi downplayed any geopolitical ambitions China may have beyond its shores regarding the Belt and Road Initiative. (Belt and Road Initiative: an infrastructure and investment program widely seen as an attempt by China to construct a massive, multi-national zone of economic and political influence that has Beijing at its center)

At the end of the Tuesday Chinese stock market, Shanghai composite index rose 1.66% to 3190.32. The market closed at 3138.29 Monday. Among all the sections, medal, bank, household appliance and several sections had the best performance, with the bank section’s net capital inflow of the fund of about 2.162 billion RMB. The news of Xi is obviously a useful catalyst for the general rising of the market after several days of fluctuation.

Gabenism;1523377836;8b8z9o;;14;;3;I have a question about options trading. I know the fundamental ins and outs, but, as we all probably have learned by now, the actual act of trading and the understanding of trading mechanisms tend to differ rather fundamentally. So for the question, I want to buy a single put option on a stock, XYZ. Option price is $3.80. Stock price is $154.70. I want the option to sell 100 shares for $150 each. My question is this: is a strike price of $150 the price at which the option is exercised? Or can I choose to exercise my option when I wish before expiration? My previous understanding was that I would have a designated sell price, e.g., $150/share, and I'd wait until the actual stock was worth only $133/share to exercise the option. Now I'm not entirely sure how to interpret the actual process. Can someone run me through a full hypothetical round trip put trade, maybe?

ScottyStellar;1523478075;8bk9ml;;3;;1;"Before I get to the numbers, a couple brief changes:

* Changed name from Insider Track to Inside Track, because I think it sounds cooler. A friend tells me R is the most menacing of letters, so we're going to get rid of one.
* Removed Dividends from my calculations. Since I am not tracking the dividends earned by VTI, it seems only fair.

Now to the fun part- Numbers! From the time of last week's update, the VTI is relatively flat- it gained .06% compared to the Inside Track portfolio which gained **1.86** over the week. This translates to the Inside Track increasing the lead by **$46.48 more** than we would have earned by investing in VTI.

This solid week for us brings our overall growth since inception to an even **5%**, compared to the VTI which has **lost 3.77%** over the same time period. 

Our overall Profit so far is resting at approximately **$125**, and our gain vs. an initial VTI investment is **$219.43**, or **8.78%** ahead of the market.

Wow, 9% ahead of the market- looks like the Inside Track so far is the faster path to take, although it is still early!

juicyfizz;1523479988;8bki90;Advice;18;;8;"I've combed through the wiki here and in a few others subs (plus google) and can't quite find what I'm looking for, so here's the deal.

I'm in a good financial situation for the first time in my life. I'm 33/F, stable career as a data engineer. Husband is an electrical engineer. 401K and IRAs are maxed, I have a good savings and emergency fund built up. I have about $500 built up in company stock as well (I keep contributing to this through my company's stock purchase plan as the company is doing well just to reap the benefits). I have 2 kids, husband and I (plus grandparents) all contributing to 529s for the kids for college. Student loans are paid off, and my car is paid off. I don't do credit cards, so no debt there. We do HSA and FSA (for the dependent care) every year.

I've had a pretty decent salary bump combined with one kid out of daycare (which gives me back an extra 350/month) plus other kid moving to a new daycare room (which gives me another 130/month). I've begun using an app that rounds up my purchases and a few other rules (1% of each direct deposit over 200, set and forget $10/week, 52 week saving rule, etc).

All that amounts to me saving up about $160/month using this method. For the past couple months, I've been compiling this money at the end of each month and putting it into a brokerage account. I have about $500 in there now, just put in $VOO.

My end goal is not to save for retirement (I mean it is, but not with this money), it's more of a saving for something (maybe a big trip, maybe a large purchase, I don't know), but not for at least 10 years. So I want to buy and hold. Here are my questions:

1. For this small amount starting, I assume just an index ETF is the best bet. Should I diversify at all yet?

2. Each month the amount grows... how should I diversify going forward? How often should I ""rebalance""?

FuninUSA;1523621946;8bypia;;4;;10;"Chinese billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Financial is about to become one of the world's most valuable companies.

Seven years ago, Ant Financial was stripped of Alibaba group. It operates the popular mobile payment service Alipay, which is also one of China's largest non-bank lenders. 

Ant Financial is in discussions with potential investors, said the source. So far, investors’ demand for subscribing Ant Financial’s shares are quite strong.

The source said, Ant Financial is preparing to raise $9 billion (about 57 billion yuan) in a round of private financing, up from its previous target of $5 billion. This round of funding could make Ant Financial the world’s largest unicorn company so far. 

Unicorns refer to private companies valued at more than $1 billion.This round of funding for Ant Financial comes ahead of its highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO). The company will IPO this year at the soonest.

If ant financial goes public with a valuation of more than $100 billion, it will be worth more than some of US biggest financial firms, including Goldman Sachs group inc., Paypal and Blackrock Corporate.

The last round of funding announced by Ant Financial was in April 2016, when it raised $4.5 billion from Chinese investors, reaching the valuation of about $60 billion.
Ant Financial's current financing targets include the investors from China, US and other foreign countries. These investors have already subscribed at least $3 billion shares of Ant Financial.

In February, Alibaba said it would buy about a third of Ant Financial shares and end its profit-sharing agreement with Ant Financial. The deal is expected to be completed in the second half of the year. When Ant Financial goes public, Alibaba and its shareholders will benefit.

For long term, the best strat seems to be to keep some in cash, most in blue chip stocks, and some in upstarts or high growth stocks.

For short term, I've heard everything from sell everything every Friday and buy intra-week during a dip to buying options only.

What advice would you give to someone looking for gains short-term in the mid 10% to 20%?

From what I've observed in this recent market at least (January to April 2018) it seems that selling every Friday and buying mid-week has the best rate of returns as long as you're buying stocks.

When buying options it is a crap-shoot akin to playing Blackjack. A buy put or buy call can make you $200 today and lose you $750 tomorrow with this volatility.

Netflix Could Be Hero for Weary Tech Investors Needing Spark.
If there’s anything left with the potential to cheer up technology investors, it’s an earnings report from Netflix Inc.

Through an onslaught of market swoons, privacy scandals and antitrust threats, the Los Gatos, California-based television and movie service has stood unscathed. More than that: the stock just had its best quarter since 2015, while companies like Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. lost ground.

“Netflix earnings can not come soon enough,” Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer for GBH Insights LLC, said in an interview. “This is a key earnings season, especially given some of the macro and political uncertainty and regulatory worries.”

The company’s earnings report on Monday is the first of the tech megacaps -- and it comes at a critical time. After four selloffs of 3 percent or more this year, the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index is trading just above the halfway mark between the March 12 record and the 2018 low on Feb. 8. 

Alphabet and Facebook, which report on April 23 and April 25, are both in the red for the year. Apple Inc. reports on May 1 and has gained 3 percent.

Enter Netflix, which has shot up faster than analysts can raise their price targets. The stock has added more than $50 billion in market value in 2018 and traded above the average price forecast for most of the past three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 

The shares rose as much as 2.7 percent Friday, their fifth consecutive gain, after Deutsche Bank raised its rating to buy and Comcast said it will add Netflix subscriptions to its cable packages.

The average estimate for Netflix’s first quarter revenue has increased by about $163 million to $3.69 billion after a blowout fourth quarter in January, according to Bloomberg data. Higher expectations combined with recent stock gains leave little room for error for Netflix, which is the second-best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 this year after Nektar Therapeutics, which only joined the benchmark index a few weeks ago.

Wall Street is looking for first quarter total subscriber net additions of 1.45 million in the U.S. and 5.0 million internationally, according to the average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. That compares with the company’s forecasts of 1.45 million and 4.9 million on Jan. 22. Deutsche Bank, in its upgrade, said Netflix may have added up to 1 million more subscribers globally in the first quarter than forecast.

“The market has been distracted by legitimate political noise, but once earnings season starts, I think the story will change dramatically,” said Ross Gerber, chief executive officer of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management. Gerber’s firm owns Netflix shares and he expects subscriber growth to exceed estimates.

Keeppgoingg;1523892055;8coaxr;;0;;1;"Hi everyone. I'm new here, so advanced apologies if this post doesn't belong. I work on the buyside and have access to resources many here do not. I figured that I could add to the community by putting out a weekly commentary on the tech market / stocks. This doesn't cause a conflict of interest for me since I will focus on broad themes and moves, rather than pitch individual stocks with specific price targets (which is my job). Below is my first attempt. I know there is a lot I can do to make it better, and I'm open to all suggestions. 

http://zenanalyst.com/2018/04/16/weekly-summary-4-13-2018/

So the question I have for the community is, ""what would you find helpful in a weekly tech summary like this""? I'll do my best to implement them! 

Some ideas / changes I've thought about implementing for the next weekly column:
1) Post every Saturday morning. This gives me enough time to digest the entire week, and leaves room for Friday night surprise announcements. 
2) A screen for weekly movers, with commentary on the driving factors such as earnings, regulation, sector rotation, etc. 
3) Start with a summary and proceed in chronological order from Saturday through Friday. 

Thanks for your feedback!

Robo13;1524025949;8d2zg9;;5;;12;"Hello, I'm pretty ignorant on this subject and would like some guidance. I was interested in what the US unemployment rate chart looked like the past few decades and you'll notice there is a pattern of extremely low unemployment followed by a very large spike in unemployment _generally_ over the course of 2 years.

&amp;nbsp;

[Here's what I'm using as a reference](https://i.imgur.com/aph5uam.png) Which is the US unemployment rate from ~1942 - 2018. It also shows the trend line which has an upward trend over the past ~80 years.

&amp;nbsp;

As you can see we have been at an almost all time low for the past 6 months (4%) which does not happen very often. It looks like we're at the bottom of that last curve, which seems to mean unemployment may start to go back up. The lowest points of unemployment seem to be in 10 year cycles:

* 1950 - 1955
* 1955 - 1960
* 1960 - 1973
* 1973 - 1980
* 1980 - 1990
* 1990 - 2000
* 2000 - 2007
* 2007 - 2018
&amp;nbsp;

Most of the lowest unemployment times only lasted ~2 years until it started to rise again. We seem to be at the mid point of that 2 year ""cycle"" and I'm wondering if I'm just seeing meaningless patterns or if we're ramping up for another rise in unemployment that might go into another 10 year cycle.

**Prepared Notes:**

- We believe that **content growth remains a powerful multiyear driver of demand in the data economy.** 
- Context for multiyear customer investments is not simply a byproduct of market efficiency.. ..**it is more fundamentally endorsed by the evergreen verticals** of climate change, education, food and water, healthcare, AI, security... etc etc
- 5G networks will drive the need for nearly **2x the DRAM contents in smartphones relative to the current global average.**
- Additionally, density increases associated with higher layer counts in 3D NANDs create the opportunity for **terabyte level storage in smartphones within the next few years**.
- For 2018 **investments by our customers remain prudent and demand led.**
- For NAND and nonvolatile memory broadly the totality of our perspective would be that **long-term demand drivers are compelling.**
- It seems that the perpetual bull-bear debate surrounds the sustainability of memory based investments. In that context, we think it is worthy to note that associated with the emergence of cloud and collectivity, **the 7-year cumulative annual growth rate for memory WFE is 15%, 10x greater than the comparable foundry logic WFE CAGR.**
- **A strong memory business in the new data economy is a sustainable asset** and not a liability from our perspective.
- **We target outperforming overall industry growth again in calendar year 2018**

**Q&amp;A:**

- **Evercore**: ..clearly a lot of debate around sustainability of memory and I was hoping maybe you could help out on the DRAM side.
- **Lan**: …it’s true to say that our customers have never spent more money, it’s also true to say that in many respects they have never spent a smaller proportion of their profits… **pricing stability of DRAM appears there.**

- **Nomura**: .. at what level do you become concerned that your DRAM customers are adding too much capacity?
- **Lan**: I would be concerned that our customers are adding a few much capacity … if end use demand concluded that there was a dramatic imbalance and **we have no evidence of that.**
- …when we look at consensus and then the construct of the market and isolate, for example, a **45% server bit growth assumption in DRAM** … We end up in the same place that our customers are articulating plans.

- **JP Morgan** (this guy fucks): overall DRAM industry capacity has been relatively flattish for the past several years, the market has been getting nervous in the amount of announced DRAM CapEx spend … **but a lot of it is just to offset capacity declines and technology conversion and just to maintain a stable bit supply output**, so wanted to get your views on how much you see total industry capacity going this year?
- **Lan**: 100% agree with what you articulated in terms of the rationale for investments whether tradition or conversion … **we do see a modest increase in capacity in DRAM associated with the driver of demand** … it’s perfectly relevant to the choices that our customers are making … **it appears modest and balanced and rational**.

yakattack145;1524069897;8d73jy;;15;;0;"Hey all,

So I've been a low-risk ""Bogleheads"" investor for years; emergency savings fund, maxing out my IRA (Vanguard) and 401k contributions (Fidelity), and some low expense ratio index funds in a taxable brokerage account (Vanguard).

However, I've been eyeing cannabis stocks for months and I think this is a unique opportunity that is hard to pass up. Although I'm late to the game, I still think there is quite a bit of growth to be seen after Canadian legalization this summer. I want to invest $2k total, split among the Big 3 (Canopy, Aurora, Aphria). 

I would ideally like to buy and hold for a few years. However, I don't have any experience with buying individual company stocks, let alone foreign ones. I want a broker with low trading commission, minimal to no account maintenance fees, and a good foreign exchange rate.

From my research, the Global Account at Charles Schwab looks pretty good. No account minimum. No account fees. Just C$14 per trade. So it would just be C$42 (14 x 3) to buy the initial shares of the 3 companies above (plus any foreign transaction fees).

What do you guys think of this? Should I go for it? Do the same capital gain taxes apply to international stocks like these (i.e., 15% long-term capital gains tax if held &gt;1yr)?";232250;Looking to invest $2,000 in cannabis stocks, appreciate help;

ScottyStellar;1524083756;8d8xt6;;0;;3;"Happy Hump Day r/stocks enthusiasts and thanks again for reading.

This week let's start with the changes:

**COGT** changed their name and stock ticker- now shows as **FLNT**

**Sold:**

* VSI on 4/18. Sold at $4.7 for just under 19% profit. One of the first holdings I've had, seemed to be bouncing around $4-4.70 so I decided to sell it off at high level, will consider purchasing again if it dips back down.

* BRS on 4/18. Sold at $16.32 for just over 25% profit.

**Bought:**

* TUP on 4/18. Bought at 44.06, wanted to get in around the $42.5-$43 level but was late to the game and didn't want to miss the opportunity as it looks like one that's hit a bottom around 41 and should be bouncing up maybe to a midpoint between there and its past home at the 60's.

* ANGI on 4/18. Bought at $14.01. Actually got in at 14 even on a limit buy in my account, but at the time I put the limit in, the stock was 14.01 and I want to keep using current market rates for this experiment to be fair.

**Weekly Change:**

Over the past week, our portfolio has grown by **3.65%** or **$95.85**

Over the same period, the VTI has grown by **2.57%**. This leads to a weekly Gain over VTI of **$28.42**, just over 1% of the initial investment value ABOVE what we'd have made if investing in VTI at the start of the week.

**Total Stats:**

From the time of conception, the VTI is actually *down* **-1.3%** or **-$32.58** on a $2,500 investment.

Our portfolio since conception is *up* **8.84%** or **$220.91**.

This lands our Overall Gain Over Default or ""O GOD"" as I have now decided to call it (yes, I just came up with that, yes, I know it's terrible), at: 

**10.14%**

- that's the percentage gain versus if we had invested in the VTI. In dollar terms, we're beating an initial VTI investment by **253.49**

FraterThelemaSucks;1524412852;8e44tz;;16;;170;"In case people didn't know, if you use a platform which ""contains"" a paper trading acccount, rather than relying on the TOS platform entirely, you can take advantage of the free real-time US equity data for paper trading.
So to keep this simple you can get NinjaTrader for free here, it's generally considered a free platform for those who didn't know.
https://ninjatrader.com/FreeLiveData
When you get NT through this method, you can pick Futures or Forex data. You *can* go back and fill out each one if you'd like say, do Futures first (that'll be through CQG and give you a *lot* of data for 7 days or 14, I can't recall) and the Forex through FXCM. Regardless, you don't have to use either one if you don't want.
After that you'll be able to download NT installer, I always go with NinjaTrader 8, it works well. Rather than 7, that is.

Simply click ""connections"" in the main panel once it's open, and add a TD Ameritrade connection with the same login/pass you'd use to login to TOS or your TD/AT online account.

One important thing to note: If you want tick data, at the least NinjaTrader will say give you 10 tick, 2, 1 tick or even intervals like 1s (literally type 1s or 10s or 1t 3t 10t etc and hit enter when you have a chart open) but I believe it's *derived* from the bar data, if that makes sense. Also if you're viewing anything less than the 1 minute bar timeframe, itll just start off at the time you've opened the chart with such tick/second/range/interval data, and no historical on the chart. So if I'm doing that I like to open a second chart in another tab of the same instrument to show the historical data.

So the paper trading account is within the NT platform, and so long as you make sure you have set up your default account to be say Sim101, the usual name of the default paper trading account, you won't be actually executing trades through the TD Ameritrade broker, but you get to trade on real-time data.

Between this being free data, the possibility of using Rithmic, CQG and FXCM trials for futures and forex, you can get basically all free data. For a paper trader like me, that's nice because I have no skin the game... I think that's the saying.

Keep in mind I'm not promoting NinjaTrader in any commercial capacity and have no affiliation with them whatsoever as a company or in any manner I can conceive. There's one other platform I use which isn't free that's compatible with TD Ameritrade's data and that's called MotiveWave. It also does support simulated trading very very well. I suggest checking it out and I'll just say Google MotiveWaveTM 4.2.8 Ultimate Edition ;)
Hope this isn't just old news everyone here has known. If so, let me know. Happy trading and hope this coming trading week is a good one.


Edit: 
Some other resources which at least have free trials available without necessarily needing any payment info I find useful are:
1) www.livesquawk.com (Especially Steve K's market signals... I've only heard of McAffe's signals but never tried them, however Steve K is a good guy and seems to really know what he's doing. Tl;dr, they work for me in paper trading).

2) https://www.tradethenews.com - you need a linkedin with 5 or more connections to get the free trial but they have a great squawk service with a guy from NYC who seems to be on literally almost 24 hours a day 5 days a week.

3) https://pro.benzinga.com - a Bloomberg Terminal alternative basically, but not as fancy... for more fancy see:

4) http://www.metastock.com/fundsoft4 This one isn't really explained the best on their own site, in my opinion but I've been using the free 30 day trial and what it is, is Metastock's own way of selling Reuters Eikon service. Eikon is about the best Bloomberg Terminal alternative I've found yet in many years of searching. I'm more into looking at data and figuring out how plats work than the actual trading in some ways. Important note on this one: Once you do have a trial, and they take a little while to rubber stamp it so be patient with the emails they send, you can login through the regular Reuters Eikon web login if you wish rather than using the Windows standalone program. They're the same one's just web-baed.

5) Lastly for now, https://www.money.net - definitely worth checking out. Has it's own live squawk for news during trading hours and definitely no payment info needed for a trial. You can login once trial acquired via login.money.net or the now 'legacy' installable platform. They're both good but I'm not crazy about the iOS/Android versions at all.";232851;You can use TD Ameritrade's real-time equity data for free, for paper trading without the 20-minute delay.;

Santoshr93;1524450538;8e86u2;Resources;14;;225;"Hi guys,

I was working on this few months back for my personal use and thought would share it with you peeps and help fellow investors.

For those who are not familiar with modern portfolio theory, [here is wiki article about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory). It is a method to optimize the allocation of your assets/stocks in a way that gives the most return for the least volatility. So given a set of stocks you would like to hold, this probably is a nice tool to determine how much percentage you could invest to reduce your net volatility while holding the maximum return.

 
Link to the drive - [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BCSEsv8AkMExHHoHPU2ZSLB3Bf0vWESU)


you can run this by typing ""python portfolio.py"" in command prompt after going into the directory where the python file is. If someone can turn it into an executable so that people not so tech-savvy people can easily use it, that would be great ! 

Once you open that you should be greeted with instructions, I have not made them handle errors data, so if things break down rerun the command again !

**inputs -**

1) number of stocks in your portfolio and the name of them (use the ticker symbol not full name - (ex - AAPL))

2) number of simulations required for calculating the optimal sharpe (higher the number of simulated portfolios better the results, i usually choose between 10,000 - 20,000 and it takes few secs in my dumb M3 surface pro)


**outputs -**

it generates a ""portfolio.png"" that contains the best percentage allocation it has found in the simulation with the sharpe ratio, expected return and standard deviation. so the outputs would be 

1) percentage allocation

2) sharpe ratio

3) expected return


Sample output - [output](https://cubeupload.com/im/5ectmG.png)



PS: starting dates for calculating everything is 01/01/2015 (data before that seems to make errors when collecting from the iex api)

Donanana;1524584477;8elddt;Question;4;;0;"I've been through Google, Youtube and of course their own website (DeGiro), but I'm just unable to get a grip on how the leverage stocks work on DeGiro. I'm a beginner in stocks and trying to get my head around all the possibilities. I'd like to invest a small part of my portfolio into these volatile turbos/speeders/sprinters. 

Lets take for example the ""AEX-INDEX SL 566.3014 HB 39.54 FN 566.3014 R 10.00 Citi BEST Turbo Short"". I think all info should be in the name, because the dashboard doesn't help me any further. My guess is that the SL stands for Stop Loss, because this isn't displayed anywhere else. The chart that's showing on the page of this turbo, has small numbers (1,000 - 1,500). This makes me conclude that they do not represent the price of the original stock. Do they represent the percentage change, maybe? This position is a short, so after buying this, I'm suppose to hope it's going down right? Would that mean that the number is already a negative (hence it should rise)? 
Besides, If what I say about the Stop-Loss is true, how can I determine when this is? Am I supposed to find the original stock and watch where it's going compared to the SL? 

I hope my description still makes sense. It's a lot of elements to cover. 

The HB in the title, stands for hefboom I suppose. Which is dutch for leverage. In this case that would mean a 39.54 leverage. So if the original stock rises €1, my turbo rises €38? Or is it a percentage?

I guess it's clear that I haven't got any grip on this concept, in the DeGiro system in specific. It would be really great if someone could clear things up for me. Please let me know if you need any more info to help me out.

New_Age_Caesar;1524585567;8elij7;;0;;2;Hi all, I’m relatively new to investing, and although I’ve seen a lot of talk regarding rising interest rates and an inflationary environment, I don’t fully understand the concept and how bond yields tie into the global economy. I understand that rising rates essentially devalue older bonds issued at lower rates, and I would presume that this would also encourage more investing (as investors will receive more $$ over time for the same amount of principal) I was wondering though what exactly the significance of the 10 year hitting 3% is. Will this lead to an increase in consumer spending as inflation ticks up and the incentive to save decreases? Thanks in advance;233296;Bond yields explained;
Nordlysvegen;1524585822;8eljst;;8;;7;"Hi,

I'm fairly new to trading, but I have read the forum rules and hope to receive some help here.

A few weeks ago I bought stock from the airline Norwegian Air Shuttle. I bought the stock at a low price and hoped that it would suddenly go up as much as they did in the past.

A few days ago International Consolidated Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, bought 5% of Norwegian and rumours went around that the IAG may be interested in completely taking over Norwegian. Over night the stock went up about 50%, even higher in the following days, and I made a low 4 digit Euros profit, which made me very happy. Now the stock has fallen, and I've already 'lost' several hundred Euros profit, which makes me less happy.

I know that predicting the future of stocks is always difficult, however, with this special case I'm curious what I can expect to happen next, for example if IAG actually fully buys Norwegian. What would happen to my stock? Do you have experience with similar past situations?

The price dropped from a high of 305 NOK to as low as 273 NOK in the last days. I'm wondering if I should sell now at still a nice profit, or hang on to it. Below I'm posting a screenshot of the last 5 years of Norwegian stock.

justinbro430;1524600049;8enge9;;1;;1;[removed];233338;$NSPNY. Does anyone have anything bad to say about this stock at its current price? Obviously, on a SOTP basis, it is grossly undervalued.;
Goal1;1524602111;8enq9h;;2;;2;"Amidst all great gains and exciting volatility in industries such as tech, one cannot help but wonder if there are still any truly undervalued stocks or industries. I for one think its getting tough, but still possible to find companies that are trading way below their proper share price range. 

I want to post a stock either once or twice a week that I feel based on fundamentals and Oscillation and Indication events that I can strongly deem very undervalued. You can take this however you want. But I feel it would be nice to have more conversations on the sub that relate to undervaluation with fundamentals in mind. 

So without further ado, here is the first stock of my list that I see making great gains in the coming year and further out.

1. Apogee Industries

This company stands out to me for many reasons. Its nice to see that we have such an undervalued company so close to the bottom of its 52 week range. It has fallen more than %18 percent in the last 52 weeks nearing its bottom. Its rocking a P/E ratio of under 16 and a PEG Ratio of 1.24. The fact that it pays a dividend with a payout ratio of of over 20% puts it at around the average of the market in general when it comes to dividend yields. Our price to cash flow is at a great 9.10, followed by a price to sales under 1 and a price book under 3. 

These numbers are good in their own right but what really makes them shine is how it compares to the rest of the industry. These numbers are 2-3x better than the rest of the building products industry. As for the growth of Apogee, its the same story. EPS growth in the last five years is nearly 5x higher, along with the Revenue growth showing the same results. The projected EPS for Apogee is equivalent to the rest, but their revenue and cash flow growth rates is enough for me to strongly state that their EPS projected will be higher than listed.

Profit margins of Apogee aren't anything special, but also nothing to cry about or be deterred away. They stay steady with the industry average. As for returns though? Apogee kills the competition. The average company in building products has a return on equity of -790%!!. Apogee is rocking a pretty 15.80% return on its equity. If you dont know Return on equity (ROE) measures how much a company earns within a specific period in relation to the amount that's invested in its common stock. This is also supported by strong return numbers when we look at their Return on investment which is over 12x higher than the rest.

Total Debt to Equity of Apogee sits at a beautiful 38%. Of course this isn't the lowest number ever but its fair. How does it compare to the industry? The industry sits at a whopping -2,982%.
When looking at short term debt the current ratio is a great indicator of how well a company can pay back their debt due in a year or less. Many value investors will argue that a current ratio above 1 is good, but I like to take the Graham approach and keep it above 1.5. Apogee is in safe to homeplate with a clean current ratio of 1.78.

Other things we can look at that many people tend to overlook are things such as Earnings yield and turnover rates. Apogee has a great yield that is over 6.47% this is VERY HIGH. Turnover rates essentially establishes the multiple that measures the efficiency of a companies use of assets and cash, and how well debt is used to boost the business' output. Its no surprise that after all these great numbers that Apogee has higher than industry and higher than the market in whole multiples on their turnover rates. No free cash flow isn't good. Some may argue that debt isn't always bad for a company and that is true, but why not have a company that's growing its operation while keeping debt down along with a good amount of cash as a cushion? Apogee does all of this.

Overall, Apogee Industries is a solid company with outstanding fundamentals ( especially compared to its industry, ) Its found a way to turn very high earning's while keeping debt down and in control. They are using their assets and loans to full advantage, while still being able to increase cash flow and revenue. ( this is told by their current ratio and interest coverage rates )

InterestingNews1;1524637405;8ergas;;8;;9;"Signet Jewelers (SIG) has had a few bad years with the stock price falling 75% as traffic mall sales decline. In March the company announced a turnaround plan to close more than 200 stores this year, cut costs, and enhance e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities. The CEO Virgia Drossos has signaled her confidence in the turnaround with a purchase of $350,000 of stock on April 16th.

With the stock trading on around 10 times the company’s own guidance for adjusted EPS of $3.75 to $4.25 this year it does look cheap. Additionally the company announced plans to buy back $475 million (or about 20%) of stock and those store closures (and other measures planned in “Signet path to brilliance”) will save $200 million or more over the next 3 years. Coupled with the share count reduction those cost reductions should boost EPS by $1.50 or more taking annual EPS to around $5.50.

Despite the huge drop in the stock price, Signet is not like numerous other retailers that are about to go bust or under attack from Amazon. Signet is a highly profitable, highly cash generative company with little debt and little competition from Amazon (as people do not buy diamonds or expensive items online).

With the stock trading on a trailing PE of 10 and forward PE of 7 it does look cheap.

1000PointsOfWhite;1524676026;8ev7ti;Advice;4;;1;"The MVIS reddit forum began with a former yahoo message board posters  desire to control the flow of information that was posted on the old yahoo message board. He started the MVIS Reddit forum and attempted to recruit the yahoo users onto his board, this was back about 2013 or so. He was unable to accomplish this task, but continued to try his best to recruit users, only ever managing to gather his pump and dump circle of thieve friends onto his latest forum. Eventually, Yahoo board made changes to their format and these changes made it more appealing for the users to switch to the controlled Reddit board, thus his recruiting efforts began to pay off. Once Yahoo message board was finally shut down, the MVIS Reddit board really began to flourish. 

The entire goal from the getgo was to  create a board where the flow of information could be controlled by the mods in an attempt to pump the stock when they so see fit and dog the stock when they see fit, follow the money as they say.

The end result is a message board that is controlled by a ring of con men that number around a dozen or so. They make  90 percent of all posts and they control what is allowed and what is not, when they see fit. All the earmarks of a pump and dump scam message board. When anyone questions this, they ban them. New posters are quickly insulted and suspected of trolling their board. A dozen or so control the over 800 members. They control what is allowed, they control what is said to be their history, which is a total fabrication made up of half truths and lies together with timeline distortions.

Here is an example of the latest poster that posted information that was not first ran past the mods :

"" \[–\][**mugsymealine**](https://old.reddit.com/user/mugsymealine) **\-1 points** 18 minutes ago 

Henry James is not going I just talked to him. That means it's a wash

\[–\][**geo\_rule**](https://old.reddit.com/user/geo_rule)\[[S](https://old.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/7tugoi/more_evidence_of_change_at_mvis_ir_leaving_at_end/)\] **2 points** 14 minutes ago 

So anonymous freshly minted Reddit account talks to Henry James about MVIS and then reports it on the internet? Nothing sketchy about that, right?

Did you post this on the thread you intended?""

Notice the down voted Karma rating, that is just one more tactic they use to control the flow of information on this forum. Henry James is a manager of State of Michigan investments which include MicroVision at present, so this info was spot on relevant to the discussion of MVIS, that Henry James was not going to attend the Annual Share Holder meeting that is coming up for this company.

The mods of this forum have very recently used a statement of an MVIS engineer \(Kevin Watson\) in a twisted attempt to pump the stock. The day that they did this, the stock had a 5X increase in volume and a 10X increase in share price. When confronted with this, the response of the mod, geo\_rule, was to ban my account.

Bottom line, **MVIS REDDIT FORUM IS A PUMP AND DUMP** that should be added to the pump and dump list for Reddit

I'm sorry for the long read and if this is posted on the wrong forum. I just get angered when I see any attempt to swindle good folks out of their hard earned cash, and that is precisely what is going on with this chat forum regardless of what happens to the stock itself.

**Weekly Portfolio Changes:**

Altered the Weekly Report spreadsheet. I had some issues with the weekly reporting sheet numbers not matching the real-time data, but have worked it out. This week's report might be a little off as I fixed it after posting, but from now on should work well!

**Sold:**

GTE at $3.11, for a total gain of $22.62 or just under 23%

BGS at $22.8, for a loss of $14.8, or just under 14%. Yes, I bought high and sold low, I'm not happy about it either but since I don't do a ton of DD into each of these stocks, I would rather get rid of some poor performers than hang on hoping for a turnaround, without any real reason to believe in one.

**Bought:**

SIG at $38.94. Already up over $40 as of this writing, for almost 3% gain so far, while the VTI has dropped 1.2% since I purchased.

RNWK at $3.52. Up a dash to 3.6 now or 2.27%, while the VTI is down 1.29% since I purchased.

**Weekly Stats:**

Over the past week, our portfolio has *lost* **1.17%** or **-$31.8**

Over the same period, the VTI investment would have lost **2.47%** or **$61.71**.

This comes to a one week **Gain over the VTI** of **$29.91**, a little over 1% over the initial investment amount.

Still, it's hard to feel good about beating the VTI when I am down on the week!

**Total Stats:**

Inside Track total gain: **$189.11** or **7.56%**

VTI total gain (on $2,500 investment): **-$93.48** or **-3.74%**

Gain over VTI: **$282.59** or **11.3%** gain over the VTI!

RandomRedditer11;1524703078;8eylh2;;17;;5;"Hello Fellow Redditors,
I am looking at investing, for long-term growth, in either Visa or American Express. Visa overall looks like it has a better and stronger company with more net income, a greater 3 and 5 year dividend increase and has a large portion of the global market share. American Express does not seem to be as strong but it is the most popular credit card, according to google statistics, in US, India, and China. These are 3 very strong and growing economies. Keep in mind I am keeping this as growth for at least 10 years.

FuninUSA;1524844999;8fcsd4;;4;;1;"According to a report, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Uber’s strong competitor, Didi Chuxing is  holding talks about an initial public offering (IPO).

The company could go public as early as the second half of 2018, the source said, but as talks are in the early stages a set date for the listing is not entirely clear.

After raising $4 billion from investors including Japanese conglomerate SoftBank last year, Didi now wants to reach a valuation of between $70 and $80 billion through an IPO, reported by the source. 

Didi Chuxing bought Uber's business in China in 2016. After fierce competition, it’s clear that Didi is the biggest platform for car-hailing so far in Chinese market. Recently, Didi said that it wants to expand its service to Taiwan. Also, Didi has expressed that it was expanding its service to Mexico, which marks the first instance of a direct expansion outside of its home market. (FuninUSA will continually report on this news)

I personally look to further development of Didi.

hybreko;1524922223;8fjw0e;;8;;5;"I have a very small position in that company (about 2% of my portfolio).
On paper it looks like a great company with a return on equity above 12%, a small debt to equity ratio (42%), they keep growing and making profit.

Now the things I find weird is that it’s a very small company (market cap of 33 millions) but they keep diversifying wich doesnt really make sense to me for such a small company...

The other thing is that they keep buying other companies but their debt stays pretty low...so I’m not saying they are cooking the books but some things look too good to be true.

To finish their brand new product is a “smart desk” wich I don’t really know what to think about.
To me everything is going towards hand held devices and I’m not sure there is a market for smart desks but maybe I’m wrong.

Anyway I brought shares a while ago but lately the company has been confusing me a lot and I’m not so confident with my investment anymore....

InterestingNews1;1525011038;8frjse;;37;;61;"Independent director Timothy Haas purchased 200,000 NBEV stock for $176,000 on Wednesday.  It was his second purchase in 12 months having also bought 85,000 stock last August.  Mr Haas has been a director since January 2017 and, having previously served as Group President of Coca-Cola Latin America, is pretty familiar with the drinks business. 

NBEV was created in 2016 and produces healthy beverages such as Búcha Live Kombucha, XingTea, Coco-Libre, and Marley.  In the short time since its inception it has become the 8th largest healthy beverage company.  Full year 2017 results saw revenues increase by over 100% while adjusted EBITDA increased to $5.2 million from $0.2 million. 

Brent Willis, CEO, commented, ""2017 results were excellent, but we know we have so much more potential and opportunity.”  He hasnt taken long to deliver on this with the announcement a week later on April 24th that  the company would be rolling out its distribution points across 83,996 points of distribution in 30,060 stores nationally in a move that is expected to boost revenue by $2 million per month or $24 million per year.  That move alone would take the revenue to $76 million compared to the stocks valuation of $73 million on Fridays close.  

For a company that is growing by 100% that looks cheap to me.  Mr Haas certainly seems to think so.

1. Stock pickers post their picks on to the blockchain, encrypted
2. The picks are automatically decrypted after a certain amount of time \- say 6 months
3. People can pay to get access to picks earlier, this price is set by the pickers

Why it could work

1. Pickers can now get fees on top of their investment gains. Furthermore there will be more buy interest, which will also increase their investment gains
2. Buyers can get access to transparent and trusted data about stock pickers’ true returns \(since blockchain is uncompromisable\), allowing them to make better decision w.r.t who to follow

ROI_Rogers;1525102490;8g0by3;;70;;50;"This stock came across my radar as I teach on an adjunct basis and I also manage money as my primary business. Every student I know who has utilized their subscription service tells me it is a platform used to help students cheat, but under the guise of ""tutoring"". This is reflected in their fast growing subscription service. They also own a few other similar firms like Cramster, explicitly known as a cheating aid. They pivoted to this model after getting caught selling bootleg textbooks for profit.

Is this business sustainable? Is it just unethical but not illegal and will continue to grow? There is a great case for longs too, it is a business that should grow if nothing gets in their way. The way I see it they are capitalizing on the IP I have created (exams and homework that I personally create) without compensation. My other thought is that if I ""can't beat them, join them"", and I can provide my own answers for my courses for compensation on their site. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts and experiences.

A few months back, TMUS and S tried to merge but couldn’t come to an agreement. Stock dropped. Months later, topic comes up again, seems like an agreement is reached, stock drops a lot more for some reason??? I don’t understand why the stock has dropped when it seems like an agreement is reached, and not too bad of a deal for TMUS. Seems pretty good for T-Mobile. Is the worry that the DOJ won’t accept this merge, so people are trying to get out? 

I am thinking about buying more stocks of TMUS bc now I feel like at $60 this stock is undervalued. I just feel as though people are worrying to much. I am not looking to sell at all, the minimum I think I am going to do is just hold unless it is looking extremely bad for TMUS to where it will drop far below where I bought it.

whiteSkar;1525291645;8gkg5i;;4;;12;"If US dollar is going to soar up after the interest rate has been decided to stay, why would it dip right after the news? Why does it just no soar up without the dip?

Same of the stock market. Why does it soar up right after the news then dip? Why does it not just dip after the news? 

I know, in general, if interest rate goes up, companies revenue growth gets hindered which causes the stock market to have a slower growth thus causing people to sell their stocks, on top of the bond going up due to higher interest rate which also causes people to get their money out of stocks and put in the bonds.

Therefore, the immediate response to the news, US dollar and bond dipping while stock market going up, makes sense to me.

What I dont get is the next phase where the inverse, dollar and bond going up while stock market is dipping, is happening.

1. I want to know why staying interest rate is causing stock market to go down and US dollar and bond to go up.

2. I also want to know why US dollar and bond dipped before going up and why stock market went up before dipping. Like, the reason why the stock market is dipping is because people are selling more since they think the market is gonna go down. If they thought the market is gonna go down, why in the first place they bought stocks causing the market to rise first?";234609;"Why does US dollar &amp; Bond dip and soar up while US stock market soar up and then dip after the news Fed kept the current interest rate?";

**Weekly Changes:**

Solved the spreadsheet Weekly report issue I was having, so all numbers now match up against the total report.

**Bought:**

**PM** at $83.10. Only one share due to not wanting to overinvest in one individual stock- and good thing, as it's down 4% since I bought it.

**NBEV** at $1.95. Also down over 3.5% and might not hang onto this one for long, but I have an affinity to smaller stocks and beverages.

**HMST** at $26.00. Finally, a winner (so far on the week), this one fits the model well with some good insider buying lately, and plan to hang onto it for a while, unless there's a quick early gain.

**Sold:**

**AAT** at $34.15 for a small gain, I only had two shares and took the opportunity of a smaller investment to get into PM after a dip and recent insider purchases. $3.4 profit or 5.3% over a month and a half.

**VERU** at $2.04 for a nice little gain of $18.15 or 19.3%.

**EPD** at $27.13 for a gain of $5.16 or 4.99%

All of these sales were at a profit, and all of the stocks have since declined from where I sold them, so my timing must be good (so far).

**Weekly Stats:**

Over the past week, our portfolio *lost* **$12.43, or .46%**

Over the same period, the VTI investment lost **$3.54, or .15%**

This comes to a one-week **Loss against the VTI** of **$8.89** or **-.36%** of the original $2500.

**Total Stats:**

**Inside Track's total gain:** **$176.08** or **7.04%**

**VTI Benchmark:**  LOSS of **$96.49** or **-3.86%

This brings us to a **Total Gain against Benchmark** of **$272.57** or **10.9%**

Barryli123;1525312588;8gmuim;;8;;0;"Just curious on your opinions on AMZN after the quarter and where it's heading. A brief summary of my research is below.

TLDR: Slowing GDP, increasing bond yield, concerns of decreasing consumer spending, and May selling led to stagnant stock price. There is good news but higher than usual amazon stock volitility makes me think that the market doesn't know how to react. Overall trend will be upwards after S&amp;P 500 stocks contacting.

I'm trying to figure out why Amazon is rather stagnant after a great quarter. So from my understanding thus far, revenues were up tremendously, leading to a ~7% hike in stock price, however, half of that was lost by the end of the day. I'm assuming this was mainly due to slowing GDP, and concerns of decreasing consumer spending. Others investors pretty much think that amazon is overvalued. More factors put into play are: increasing bond yield, increasing FED interest rates, increasing unemployment rate. (There's definitely more that I'm missing, but I think these are the major factors)

But if we take a look on the other spectrum, we see Amazon raising the price of Prime and Prime retention, rapid growth in their AWS business, and a majority of analyst mark it as a buy.

I personally think it's currently a battle between US market correction vs stock performance pricing. So relative to the market (tracking by S&amp;P 500), AMZN is doing well but stock price is decreasing because the whole market is contracting. So once the market contractions end, AMZN price should increase, but the question now becomes how long will the contraction last, and will there be a recession? A thing of interest I've noticed are larger fluctuations in AMZN stock price sometimes from roughly -1.5% to +1.5% and vice versa. I think for a stock at this price, it's highly unusual that the stock price is this volatile so the market is uncertain of how to react.

This is my personal opinion and feel free to leave your opinions.

the percentage of companies that have beaten consensus analyst EPS estimates this season stands at 71.6%.  Any reading over 70% is very strong relative to past earnings seasons.

Below we take the beat rate analysis a step further and look at sector beat rates this season.  As shown, five sectors have beat rates that are stronger than the overall market, while six sectors have weaker beat rates.

The Industrials sector is the standout with a beat rate of 79.5% this season.  Technology ranks second at 75%, followed by Health Care and Consumer Staples at 73.1%.

On the weak side, Telecom and Energy both have earnings beat rates below 60%, while Utilities and Real Estate are below 65%.

wannabemanwhore;1525505458;8h61j8;;24;;0;"Hi, I'm from Indonesia and new in stock investment. So about 10 days ago I decided to buy 3 stocks consisting of 3 of the 5 largest banks in Indonesia with nearly equal portions each.

My reasoning was that:

1. I wanted to be safe so let's buy large banks stocks. Historically, the 1-year return was very good, 30%-40% and had always grew YoY. There's no chance of these banks going bankrupt.

2. I thought in May, the price would soar, so I decided to buy a lot because I thought now is a good entry point.

3. At first I wanted to invest and not trade. So I thought I wouldn't mind the volatility but now it got scary.

I decided to spend about 75% of my asset to these 3 stocks. Shockingly, once I bought, the price dropped ridiculously since the very same day until now. Many believe that it will continue to drop until about September. This is so frightening.

My mistake was:

1. I didn't set any cut loss point. I thought I was gonna go for long term and I didn't think it was gonna end up this bad anyway. My mentality was ""I just lose money on paper, but one day the trend will reverse inevitably"". I thought I was gonna go for long term, but apparently I need the money to make more money. 

2. I invested too much for the first time, instead of doing a trial first. I really thought It was gonna go up.

Please help me how can I save these stocks? I'm thinking to average down once it reaches it's lowest point. I can't afford to lose this much as a beginner.

Alternatively, should I stop thinking about these 3 stocks at the moment and use what's left for investing in good bullish stocks?

Thanks so much in advance.

One of the many pearls of wisdom dispensed by Warren Buffett is “Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Don’t forget rule No. 1”.  Unfortunately this is easier said than done in the real world. Fund managers are acutely aware of investor aversion to losses.

Losses on portfolios can be due to market movements in the price of the investments or when investments go under or default on their obligations. The latter is permanent capital loss, as there is no opportunity to recover the losses suffered. African Bank is an example of this. Investors may get some of their capital back, but will unlikely get a material portion of it back.

When suffering losses, an investor requires a return higher than the loss to return to breakeven.

 I was an avid swing trader with great success for about a year which allowed me to accumulate some wealth. I had one harsh lesson where I lost about 2k and brought me back down to reality a little, as well as neutered me when it comes to biotech investing. However TRVN looked to juicy despite their financials(not that financials are a major moving point in small biotech companies) and ive make a fast 5 or 6% in just a few days when I noticed the ETF IBB was a strong swing trade. A product with proven efficacy, safety, and is marketable is the goal here. Then a larger company will buy them out and you make bank, unfortunately I let emotions of past experience affect my investment amount. Its up 40% in I think about 2 months, and they already have brokered 2 partnerships in Asia. 

So far in my 2 years of trading, Ive not only times markets with precision. Ive assumed correctly when to rotate out of sectors and into others. As for the meat, well kinda bragging but Im wondering due to my short experience if Im just constantly lucky. Which I consider the most logical explanation.

When we had the run up in january I noped the fuck out of stocks.  Hastely, I went into bonds, a REIT ETF , and a few odds and ends. BABA has treated me well as for every 5% down I bought 5 more shares, then ive been selling back for an alright profit. I managed to pull off $190 limit orders on Friday halfing my position. The stock I have left was bough at I think $172.

Now for a little proof so you dont think im just talking out of my ass [after then january runup I felt a correction was imminent and acted fast](https://imgur.com/a/glnAEr3). Is sold most my stocks I pulled out of financials with amazing results, id been lowering my positions beforehand as over 100% profit on BOA and 60% on MS seemed alright with me. Right now im at about 15% equities and need my investment money short term so plan to keep it that way unfortunately. 

Sometimes I feel the mantra that you cannot time the market is something fed to us by institutions so they can take our money. From my 2 years experience, maybe its sheer luck. However I have timed the market and made changes with almost 100% success. If you look at the graph I posted you can see how I felt a correction coming beforhand. I realized most of my gains so thats why you see a small loss. BABA and VNQ are both up and not showing due to pending settlements so the actual amount is down -1.03% vs Also because my dividends on my bonds are mostly paid monthly I am much closer to -0.5% loss over the period of time. DJIA is down 7.22%

Am I just getting really lucky? TBH I really feel its a mixture of both. My purpose of this post is not to just gloat. I want to know if there is some delusion in my mind as to my abilities to notice changes of trend in equities markets. ";235129;Dont try to time the market they say, im starting to have my doubts;

Based on my research, the stock price remains undervalued due to a lack of concrete earnings, and long-term investors getting tired of delays regarding their most advanced drug, RGN-259 eye drops.

The next news we’re expecting is the approval of RGN-259 for sales as soon as the phase 3 re-trial is completed. The re-trial will be the same as the recent phase 3 trial, but with a larger population sample size (to prove safety more accurately). Since the first 3 trials all went very well, the probability of any setbacks with the last re-trial is very low. It’s about as close as I’ve found to a sure-thing in a while (in terms of a new drug moving to market while stock price is this low).

basil_nuts;1525804367;8hz2z7;;61;;65;Hello all, so I've been doing some research on a company called First Solar and I really like their product and how its more environmentally friendly and more efficient. The thing is, because of Trump's Solar Tariffs which are expected to gradually decrease for the next five years, it will make the pricing more competitively. This is because the CdTe solar modules that are produced by First Solar are not affected by the tariffs unlike the traditional crystalline silicon solar modules and the ending of the tariffs will allow their competitors to lower their prices. I guess what I'm asking is, can the company still present strong growth in the years after the tariffs? Customers pretty much will have to decide if the marginal cost for the marginal benefit (more efficient energy, more environmentally friendly) is worth the investment.

Biotechs;1525879429;8i6to5;;9;;4;"Long time lurker, long time biotech investor. Thought I might as well share the research behind my investments. Here is the first one, if people like it I can do a write up on my other investments:

Achaogen’s stock has been unfairly punished following the recommendations offered by the FDA advisory committee. If anything, investors should be assured about the almost guaranteed FDA approval of Plazomicin for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI).

10% –That’s the estimated percent of women with a urinary tract infection in any given year. More conservatively, the number of cases per year is estimated at 150 million, putting it ahead of world-wide cancer cases by a factor of 10 (~14 million), and on par with the flu. Often these are simple to treat, but in the case where the infection involves the upper urinary tract, is recurrent, occurs in men, or in a patient with diabetes or who is otherwise immuno-compromised, the infection becomes a complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI). This is the pool of patients that Achaogen is seeking to treat with its soon-to-be-approved candidate, Plazomicin.

Pathology aside, the cUTI market is too widespread for an accurate assessment of the number of patients. The number of generics already in the market, such as meropenem, also makes an estimate for peak sales difficult. Perhaps the best comparable is the acquisition of The Medicine Company’s cUTI portfolio by Melinta Therapeutics for $270 million in upfront payments and up to 25% in royalties on world-wide sales. An analyst has predicted peak sales for Vabomere, a cUTI treatment from The MedCo’s basket, at $350 million in 2027. This brings forth two important considerations: Vabomere is a combination of meropenem and another drug that prevent bacteria from degrading meropenem. The second consideration is that Plazomicin was tested against meropenem and demonstrated clear superiority. Thus it is likely that this therapy will take a backseat to Plazomicin.

Two phase 3 trials were performed to evaluate the efficacy of Achaogen’s Plazomicin compared to the current gold-standard treatment. The Phase 3 EPIC trial conformed to the FDA’s guidelines on developing drugs for cUTI, and demonstrated statistical superiority to meropenem. The minimum requirement for a drug approval in this space is proof of non-inferiority. Hence the determination of superiority guarantees FDA approval of Plazomicin, despite a slight uptick in the number of treatment related adverse events.

The second Achaogen trial, CARE, was conducted to evaluate plazomicin for bloodstream infections using a non-conventional trial format. This trial also demonstrated improved survival, but the low sample size led to an 11-4 recommendation against plazomicin for BSI. Fortunately for value investors, the loss of the BSI indication is not worth the 28% drop seen in the stock following the AdCom results.

Furthermore, a rejection of Plazomicin for BSI treatment is not assured, the AdCom provides only voluntary guidance. The bloodstream approval would be evaluated under a novel FDA program, and the beneficial safety profile of Plazomicin gives the FDA an incentive to approve Plazomicin, if not for any other reason than the fact that few options exist for treating patients with carbapenem-resistant bloodstream infections. Of course, one potential outcome is that the FDA asks for additional data post-approval, draining Achaogen of important financial resources.

Finally, what do the financials at Achaogen look like? The market cap of $500 million doesn’t make AKAO a screaming buy. With only a single approval for Plazomicin, it will have to perform extremely well post-launch, likely requiring a resource-intensive marketing campaign. While there are other candidates in the Acahogen pipeline, these are exceptionally far from approval. Negatives aside, with an almost guaranteed approval of Plazomicin by June 25, investors can expect an almost certain bump in the stock price. Perhaps even a doubling in the next 6 months. With cash equivalents of $144 million and an available credit facility, dilution shouldn’t happen for the remainder of 2018.

Short-term, AKAO looks like a great investment, if for nothing then to capitalize on the hype from an FDA approval for cUTI, and perhaps a bonus approval for BSI. Long-term, the potential looks much less certain, but with considerable upside possible.

As always, investors should perform their own research and risk assessment before purchasing stocks, and I don't assume any responsibility for losses incurred.

**Macro**

*Buffett indicator*In a 2001 Fortune piece, Buffett outlined a formula that offered the best snapshot of the overall value of the market.

The formula is total stock market capitalisation \(as measured by the Wilshire 5000\) value divided by US Gross Domestic Product.

*3\% Treasury Yield*The 3&amp;#37; treasury yield isn’t a valuation metric, but it’s an indicator that the tide is turning on equities. T\-bills are largely considered a low\-risk investment option. When yields approach 3&amp;#37;, the rate of risk\-free return in the marketplace increases for investors.

This means that some market participants could be convinced to leave the market in favour of safer returns.

*Debt To GDP*An overall metric for the amount of debt in an economy. This figalonelong might not help much \- it functions best when paired with other metrics.

For example, a rapid acceleration in debt in high debt to gdp countries can foreshadow the bursting of a credit bubble, provided the debt is high enough.

Value Investing Metrics

**Value Investing**

*PE Ratio*PE ratio shows a company’s price relative to its earnings.

e.g. A company earning $100m per annum with a market cap of $1bn. would have a pe ratio of 10.

PE ratio is a good measure of value for a business generating considerable free cash flow in non\-changing industries.

Investors should be careful though because the valuation metric can sometimes be misleading. For example, if a company’s earnings are expected to drop, the pe ratio fo the stock might fall because the market is forecasting the drop. The stock might seem cheap, but it’s pe ratio will jump from really low to really high when earnings are released.

*ROIC \- Return On Invested Capital*ROIC is the return on an investor’s capital over a particular time horizon. A high ROIC normally indicates that a company has a high quality brand.

If you invest 1,000 in a business and your investment generates $1,100 in a year, the ROIC is 10&amp;#37;.

ROIC is similar to return on equity, except it measures the return on equity and debt. Return on equity just measures equity.

*Current Ratio*Current ratio tells investors how well a company can pay back its short\-term liabilities and short\-term assets. If the current ratio is over 1.0, the firm has more short\-term assets than liabilities. If the ratio is less than 1, the opposite is normally true \- the company could be vulnerable to shocks in the economy.

*Discounted Free Cash Flow*This is the metric favoured by most value investors. The discounted free cash flow model gets investors to future earnings over the next 5\-10 years.

It is important to select companies with relatively predictable future cash flows and positive cash flows. Most small companies will not meet this requirement, because they usually have larger capital expenditures.There are three components to the DCF model

*Free Cash Flow*The amount of cash a business is generating and can distribute to the share holders.

Terminal value \- value of the money at the end of the investing horizon

The DCF gets users to calculate the total cash flow from an investing horizon. This model is then compared to return on treasury bills \(considered almost risk\-free return\).

If you think a stock is worth $20 based on a DCF model and the current price is $10. It is under\-valued.

A:Present value \(PV\) is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flow given a specified rate of return. Meanwhile, net present value \(NPV\) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time.

*Piotroski F Score*The P F score is named after Professor Joseph Piotroski who devised the investment thesis while at theUniversity of Chicago. Piotrovski identified that value investors were attrcated to companies under temporary stress. Most times investors put capital in businesses that turned around, but sometimes businesses never picked up again and petered out.

The scale is designed to weed out the companies which have a better chance at long\-term survival and the companies will fail.

The scale is from 1\-9. 9 Represents the best companies. You can read more here

\([http://www.midf.com.my/images/Downloads/Research/EqStrategy/Earnings/Strategy\-Quant\-Piotroski\-F\-Score\-MIDF\-131017.pdf](http://www.midf.com.my/images/Downloads/Research/EqStrategy/Earnings/Strategy-Quant-Piotroski-F-Score-MIDF-131017.pdf)\)

The P\-formua was the only stock picking strategy which yielded positive absolute returns in 2008.

*Price To Book Value*The value of a firm’s assets minus its liabilities is the book value of a stock. Value investors can guarantee a margin of safety when they invest in a company trading below book value.

This means that the entire business were to stop suddenly generating cash, the assets on the balance could still be paid off to return money to shareholders.

Value investors will usually calculate the book value of a stock themselves without relying on screeners. Companies have intangible assets which are not counted on the stock’s balance sheet like human capital, or franchise value.

A stricter version of book value is breakup value. This is the value of the assets if the company were to break up.

*Dividend Growth History*The growth of a company’s dividend is important for long\-term dividend growth investors.

Dividend payouts illustrate a company’s attitude to shareholders. The longer a company has increased their dividends, the more shareholder friendly they become.

Coca cola for example has increased its dividend every year for the past thirty years and probably long before that as well.

*FCF To Debt*Indicates whether a company can cover its own debt expenses. A higher number means there is more FCF from operations to cover debt and interest expenses.

*EV/EBITDA*PE ratios can sometimes disguise the true nature of a business’ health. The energy sector for example is a cyclical business in which earnings fluctuates.

Generally speaking, the metric means you are spending less money for $1 earnings. Be careful not to get caught in value traps, because there are exceptions:

1. A high growth company might have very low current earnings but huge upside and therefore will trade at a higher multiple.
2. Some companies are riskier \(however you want to define risk\) and thus warrant a lower multiple.
3. Some companies are cyclical and thus the current multiple is skewed by where the market thinks we are in an economic cycle.
4. There’s important line items underneath EBITDA such as reinvestment needs \(WC needs, Capex, R&amp;D etc\). This will skew an EV/EBITDA calc.

The EV metric should never be used on its own, but rather to get a snapshot of the business’ overall health. Investors should

Net Net Working Capital To Net Current Asset Value

**Value Investing Checklists**

*Ben Graham*

1. An earnings\-to\-price yield at least twice the AAA bond yield.
2. A price\-earnings ratio less than 40 percent of the highest price\-earnings ratio the stock had over the past five years.
3. A dividend yield of at least two\-thirds the AAA bond yield.
4. Stock price below two\-thirds of tangible book value per share.
5. Stock price two\-thirds “net current asset value.”
6. Total debt less than book value.
7. Current ratio greater than two.
8. Total debt less than twice “net current asset value.”
9. Earnings growth of prior ten years at least 7 percent on an annual basis.
10. Stability of growth of earnings in that no more than two declines of 5 percent or more in the prior 10 years.

*Walter Schloss*

1. Ten\-year track record
2. No long\-term debt
3. A low price\-to\-book value ratio
4. A stock at hear 52 week low
5. High insider ownership

*Joel Greenblatt*

1. While studying the footnotes is crucial, the big picture is most important: Earnings yieldand ROIC are the two most important factors to consider, with the key being figuring outnormalized earnings.
2. High earnings yield, based upon normalized earnings, is important in order to have amargin of safety. High ROIC \(again based on normalized earnings\) simply tells you howgood a business it is.
3. Independent thinking, in\-depth research, and the ability to persevere through near\-termunderperformance, are three keys to being a successful value investor.
4. Worrying about near\-term volatility has nothing to do with being a successful valueinvestor.
5. Think of a concentrated portfolio as if you lived in a small town and had $1 million toinvest. If you have carefully researched to find the best 5 companies, the risk is minimal\(As Charlie Munger says, “The way to minimize risk is to think.”\)
6. Special situations are just value investing with a catalyst.
7. International investing may offer the best opportunity, at least in terms of cheapness.
8. Finding complicated situations that no one else wants to do the work to figure out is away to gain an advantage. \(You have discussed and given examples of many suchsituations in your book, You Can Be a Stock Market Genius.\)
9. Looking at the numbers best way to learn about management. What have they done withthe cash? What are the incentives? Is the salary too high? Is there heavy insider selling?What is their track record?
10. Focus on understanding and buying good businesses on sale, and don’t worry about themacro economy. Everything is cyclical, so value can always be found somewhere.
11. Focus on situations that are not of interest to big players \(usually small\- and mid\-cap,although currently large caps are cheap; spin\-offs may be such opportunities, but the keyis to figure out the interests of insiders; bankruptcies, restructurings, and recapitalizationsmay also be such opportunities\).
12. Trust no one over 30, and no one under 30; must do your own work, rather than simplyride coat\-tails.
13. Risk is permanent loss of invested capital, and not any measurement of volatility developed by statisticians or academicians.
14. All investing is value investing and to make a distinction between value and growth ismeaningless.\) Thus, you understand the context of value investing. The most important step, which you have already completed, is to understand the market in context. If your investments go down, but you have done your homework, then understanding this broader context means that the short\-termunder\-performance should not bother you. Again, understanding this context is crucial whenthings don’t go your way. Buffett on the two things you need:

*Jim Chanos \- Value Traps*\-Cyclical and/or overly dependent on one product \(e.g., anything housing related in 2000s. –Ed.\)\-Cycles sometimes become secular \(steel, autos\)\-Fad does not equal sustainable value \(Coleco, Salton, renewable energy\)\-Illegal does not equal value \(online poker\)\-Hindsight as the driver of expectations\-Technological obsolescence \(minicomputers, Eastman Kodak, video rentals\)\-Rapid prior growth – “Law of Large Numbers” \(telecom build\-out\)\-Marquis management and/or famous investor\(s\)\-New CEO as savior – ignoring Buffett’s maxim \(Conseco\)\-The “Smart Guy Syndrome” \(Take your pick!\) \(Lampert/ESL/SHLD? – Ed.\)\-Appears cheap using management’s metric\-EBITDA \(cable TV, Blockbuster\) \(EBITDA\[anything else\] too. – Ed.\)\-Ignore restructuring charges at your own peril \(Eastman Kodak\)\-“Free” cash flow…? \(Tyco\)\-Anything non\-GAAP, industry specific, and/or new deserves special cynicism. – Ed.\-Accounting issues\-Confusing disclosure \(Bally Total Fitness\)\-Nonsensical GAAP \(subprime lenders\)\-Growth by acquisition \(Tyco, roll\-ups\)\-Fair Value \(Level 3 assets\)\-“A lot of our best shorts have looked short all the way down. Just because something is cheapdoesn’t make it a good value. A lot of times the company can get into distress due to a decliningbusiness. That defines a value trap.”

*Buffett \- Qualiative Metrics*

• Strong And Honest Management 

\- Buffett probably took this from Fisher, still it’s a very significant metric for him. When you’re looking at a company, it’s impossible to identify the honesty and integrity of every employee.

But the culture a management team creates peters down through an organisation. If the management are honest, the employees will be too.

• An Easy To Understand Business \- Buffett looks for uncomplicated business in his investing areas \(something he called his strike zone\)

**Growth Investing**

*Zulu Principles*The Zulu principles were coined in Jim Slater’s investing book “The Zulu Principle”. The concept is to buy companies which analysts are forecasting will increase earnings but that are trading at a low price relative to earnings.

Criteria:

• Low PEG \(price\-earnings ratio relative to the growth rate\) .075

• PE ratio of \&lt;20

• Strong cash flow per share. The preferred criteria is a pe of 10\-20 with a forecasted increase in earnings by 15&amp;#37;\-30&amp;#37;.

• Solid competitive advantage \(high ROIC and good operating margins\)

*Scuttlebutt method* 

Philip Fisher was a famous growth investor and the scuttlebutt was the formula he outlined in his 1957 book \- Common Stocks Uncommon Profits.

The scuttlebutt method is a series of criteria for investing in a stock.

1. Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizeable increase in sales for at least several years?
2. Does the management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will still further increase total sales potentials when the growth potentials of currently attractive product lines have been exploited?
3. How effective are the company’s research and development efforts in relation to its size?
4. Does the company have an above\-average sales organization?
5. Does the Company have a worthwhile profit margin?
6. What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
7. Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
8. Does the company have outstanding executive relations? Does management hire from within? Are salaries regularly reviewed? Is their confidence in the president and/or the chairman?
9. Does the company have depth to its management?
10. How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
11. Are there other aspects of the business, somewhat peculiar to the industry involved, which will give the investor important clues as to how outstanding the company may be in relation to its competitors?
12. Does the company have a short\-range or long\-range outlook to profits?
13. Does the management talk freely to investors about its affairs when things are going well but “clam up” when troubles or disappointments occur?
14. Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?";235755;Useful Investing Metrics;

http://www.wipro.com/documents/resource-center/library/Wash_Sale_Adjustments-Impact_on_Cost_Basis_Reporting.pdf

Wash sales are something i’ve paid a lot of attention to since the first year I was trading I got a tax bill much higher than the profits I made. This was because I kept buy back shares of companies I took a loss in within 30 days. My profits were around $14,000 but I had to pay about $20,000 worth of taxes. Not too bad, but avoidable.

One question I have that I wasn’t able to find out through the PDF is how averaging down effects your wash sale.

Lets say I bought 1 contract of RTN for $169 (strike and expiry don’t matter in this case). Over the course of a few weeks I continued to average down to the point 5 contracts had the average price of $60. I then sold all 5 contracts for $90.

Does the sale count as a loss from my first contract, despite my subsequent contracts being in profit, thus triggering a wash sale if I buy more contracts within 30 days? Or does it take into account the average cost of the contracts?

Hoping someone has the answer to this complicated question. If I were to guess, its probably whatever disadvantages the most, so they probably count my first contract as a loss and I should wait 30 days before buying another RTN contract.";235769;Wash sale rule question;

My interest actually stems from the many potential applications for the photonics industry. I understand that there was some craze about OLED screen potential, which has cooled off a ton. But I still feel like there could be a variety of applications in the years (yes, years) to come. And maybe now is a good time to buy since there is so much bearish sentiment from the OLED situation.

wyatt2139;1525957923;8ierjw;;6;;3;"Hey guys,

I just wanted to quickly ask a question regarding YoY vs QoQ and it's significance in stock trading. I do know what they mean, but I just don't understand their dynamics..

For example:
Company A recorded earnings in Q1 2018, of $10M in net income and in Q4 2017 it recorded $5M in net income.

For this I understand that the company is growing on a YoY-basis (by 50%) which is a good indicator that it's doing well. But what I don't understand is this part:

However in Q1 2017, it recorded a net income of $15M compared to this year where it earned (Q1 2018) $10M of net income (-$5M less).

Does this indicate that, on a QoQ the earnings have decreased? Is this a bad thing, that they haven't beaten last quarters profits? Which indicator should I be following best? And does it matter they haven't reached Q1 2017 profits, but managed to increase profits in  Q4 2017, instead?";235856;YoY vs QoQ;

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DcqzcKlU0AEyEoj.jpg

The indexes are widely used as a kind of shorthand for U.S. economic health, appearing on nightly newscasts and President Trump's tweets.

But for many, perhaps most, American households, those indexes measure an economy far removed from their own daily concerns. One figure from a recent working paper by New York University economist Edward Wolff illustrates that point: Fewer than 14% of American households directly own stock in any company.

Even when you consider indirect ownership via 401(k) retirement accounts and similar vehicles, about half of U.S. households don’t own any stock at all.

Until the early 2000s, stock ownership had been on the rise. From 1989 to 2001, the percentage of households directly owning stock rose to 21.3% from 13.1%, while the percentage owning any stock — including indirect ownership via 401(k)s — increased to 51.9% from 31.7%, per Wolff's analysis.

But since then, stock ownership has declined. The share of households directly owning stock in 2016 (13.9%) is similar to the share in the early 1990s. The total rate of stock ownership, including indirect holdings, has fallen too but by a slighter amount, owing to the continued popularity of 401(k) retirement plans.

GroundControl13;1526271490;8j9kku;;3;;5;"I’m reading about $TVIX on Six Figure Investing and I come across this

&gt;the price of TVIX is not driven by supply and demand—it’s a small tail on the medium sized VIX futures dog, which itself is dominated by SPX options (notional value &gt; $100 billion).

&gt;The index is maintained by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The theoretical value of TVIX if it were perfectly tracking 2X the daily returns of the short term index is published every 15 seconds as the “intraday indicative” (IV) value.

Yet later, this:

&gt;Wholesalers called “Authorized Participants” (APs) will at times intervene in the market if the trading value of TVIX diverges too much from the IV value.  If TVIX is trading enough below the IV value they start buying large blocks of TVIX—which tends to drive the price up, and if it’s trading above they will short TVIX.

Why would buying a ton of TVIX stock drive the price up if it’s not tied to demand?

BornOfAMammal;1526340236;8jgvaf;;7;;10;A couple weeks ago I read about a little California company called Kush Bottles.  They make an assortment of marijuana paraphernalia, including child-resistant plastic bottles.  They seem to be growing the business well and are actively going into states that are legalizing weed and lobbying law-makers to require child-resistant storage, which seems pretty clever.  The OTC stock was languishing around $2 most of last year but generated some interest earlier this year and went as high at $8 before pulling back some.  I bought it at $5.61 on 5/2 and it's up to $6.60 today (5/14) for a nice little 17.6% bump in a couple weeks.

akostatus;1526401215;8jmv7z;;40;;17;" For almost a decade, it’s been extremely difficult to lose money in the U.S. stock market. Over the next decade, it could be hard to do anything but, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley.

The outlook for market returns has precipitously worsened in recent months, with analysts and investors growing increasingly confident that the lengthy bull market that began in the wake of the financial crisis could be, if not coming to a close, petering out. More market participants view the economy as being in the late stage of its cycle, and a recession is widely expected in the next few years. All of that could result in an equity\-market environment that’s a mirror image of recent years, where gains were pretty much uninterrupted, and volatility was subdued.

“2018 is seeing multiple tailwinds of the last nine years abate,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a report to clients that was entitled “The End of Easy,” in reference to the investing environment. “Decelerating growth, rising inflation and tightening policy leave us with below\-consensus 12\-month return forecasts for most risk assets. After nine years of markets outperforming the real economy, we think the opposite now applies as policy tightens.”

As part of its call, Morgan Stanley reduced its view on global equities to equal weight, saying they were “in a range\-trading regime with limited 12\-month upside.” It raised its exposure to cash, following Goldman Sachs, which last week upgraded its view on the asset class on a short\-term basis.

U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annualized 2.3&amp;#37; in the first quarter, below the 3&amp;#37; average of the previous three quarters, as consumer spending hit its weakest level in five years. While slowing growth isn’t the same as a contraction, the data added to concerns that a period of synchronized global growth was coming to a close. According to a BofA Merrill Lynch Global survey of fund managers in April, just 5&amp;#37; of respondents expect faster global growth over the coming 12 months, compared with the roughly 40&amp;#37; that did at the start of the year.

One of the primary reasons for Morgan Stanley’s tepid view revolves around central bank policy, which investors have increasingly cited as a primary risk factor. The Federal Reserve in particular is moving away from an accommodative monetary environment. The U.S. central bank has been gradually shifting its monetary policy in two significant ways: raising interest rates and reducing the size of its balance sheet. Low rates and the Fed’s bond\-buying program are seen as major contributors to the equity market’s massive rally over the past decade, and losing them could lower or remove a floor that has limited equity losses for years.

“These cyclical and structural headwinds are quite the one\-two punch,” Morgan Stanley wrote, adding that rising interest rates and a possible change in the economic cycle raised “the risk of a turn that would suggest strategically depressed returns.” Earlier this year, the investment bank said that expectations for future returns were at an 11\-year low, or at their weakest level since before the financial crisis.

Howard Wang, the co\-founder of Convoy Investments, called the Fed’s ballooning balance sheet “the fundamental driver of asset prices over the last decade.” He provided the chart below, which compares the growth in the U.S. money supply against the long\-term return of all assets, including global equities, bond categories, real estate, and gold. 

**1970\-2008** 

* US Money Base Annual Growth **\(9\%\)**
* Average financial asset annual return **\(9\%\)**

**2009\-2014**

* US Money Base Annual Growth **\(19\%\)**
* Average financial asset annual return **\(15\%\)**

**2015\-today**

* US Money Base Annual Growth **\(\-1\%\)**
* Average financial asset annual return **\(2\%\)**

 Courtesy Convoy Investments“I believe the trend of shrinking money supply in the system will continue for some time to come,” Wang wrote. “This adjustment is a painful but necessary process for healthier markets and economies.”

 So far this year, the U.S. stock market has mostly traded in a tight range. After rallying in January, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, \-0.97&amp;#37; and the S&amp;P 500SPX, \-0.86&amp;#37; swiftly fell into correction territory, where they have remained ever since—their longest such stretch since the financial crisis. A relatively strong May performance, however has pushed both indexes back into positive territory for 2018, with the S&amp;P 500 up 2.1&amp;#37; in the year to date, while the Dow is up 0.7&amp;#37;.

Intellx - Today at 12:42 AM
I've said it before I'll say it again, learn from the people who've lived it. How fickle and forgetful can a government be!? 

Don't be negligent of history or else it tends to repeat itself...

This was an issue in 2013... and go figure, companies and the government abused their then, and they are doing so now. What do I mean? Currently ISPs have been regranted their rights(for no explainable reason) to illicitly monitor and discriminate against certain internet traffic.

here are some examples:
Internet fast lanes- Did you know companies like AT&amp;T not only make an insane mark up on their services of over 100% return per year.... seriously after infrastructure is in place. Its a turn key solution.. costing them maybe $7 bucks a month when the average customer pays $75-$150 a month. For very mediocre internet solutions. I get about 50Mbps when the technology to provide 20 times the performance at 1000Mbps has been around and cost effective for years. Yet they have refused to reinvest in infrastructure. This is infrastructure already being used in countries like China and Korea.  AT&amp;T and VZ have even received special  tax breaks... many times in the past SPECIFICALLY for the purpose of upgrading infrastructure. And they never did it.. So after all that congress gave them the privilege... to intentionally slowdown the connection to compeating services or really all services so that customers would pay ""EXTRA"" to be aloud to browse the internet at full speed and not throttled speed... greed

Censorship- hand in hand with this right they can slow the speed of competing services so much that they become impossible to use and unusable... cough cough... ""Imagine you're lively hood is derived from the stock market and you need access to accurate and honest new sources......... which can be so hard to come by these dayssssss...."" AT&amp;T or VZ could effectively make it impossible for you to hear about any negative press regarding their companies. That's called being anti competitive. That creates monopolies. 

Privacy- Internet being under title 2 is REALLY what will protect your privacy.... imagine you trade stocks for a living and spend hours weeks researching a company just for CNBC to buy your information and try and claim it as their big idea

Discrimination- Lets say somebody wants to go to PornHub! They have so many ads that are often undesirable, containing viruses or malware so that user chooses to use and Ad Blocker when visiting this website or all sites.
💯1
Currently a website can deny you entry or use of their services for any reason they may choose. So if PornHub does not allow their users to use an Ad Blocker they will not be able to use the website until it is turned off.
💯1
Slightly different example..... Imagine you trade stocks for a living and enjoy talking about stocks on any platform. But corrupt services like StockTwits, who disagree with freedom of speech and Choose to silence people, with no explanation.
that would all change under Title 2.
They cant reply to an email yet they still have the nerve to put my stock picks in their news letter..

Here's everything you need to know about Title II, the legal provision that gives net neutrality a chance at survival.

I like how that's not even the title of the article yet the thumbnail has an extremist connotation ""Title II is the key to net neutrality—so what is it?""
Intellx - Today at 1:16 AM
I encourage you all to call your respective states congressmen... or all of them :wink:  to call your local congressman and or leave them a voicemail to explain to them the urgency of this issue. Even if you don't know ANYTHING about technology just telling them that this is an issue that is important to you!!!! And that you will take into consideration their choice on this issue when it comes to reelection. As you will have a complete list of ever member of the house and senate who votes for or against this issue. 

Or you can read everything I just wrote in its entirety over the phone to them while they listen. They are paid by your tax dollars, they want to do what they can to make their voters happy.

You can use this link below and put in your ZIP code to see  the contact information for everyone of your states senators. including Phone number, Twitter handle, and an email address which im personally also going to copy and paste all this into and send in. It will also provide you with a optional body of text you could use, when explaining net neutrality to your congressmen. So all the work is done for you. At the end of the day it really doesn't matter what you say the shear volume of people showing concern for this issue is all it takes to see real change.

This is the same thing we had to do in 2014 to have Title 2 originally put in place.  then repealed buy bribes and now we are trying to put Title 2 back in place. People are capable of anything they just need their voices to be heard.

Just-Touch-It;1526693138;8ki2ls;;3;;1;"Happy Friday my friends! Today I was hoping to share with you all a company I recently purchased some shares of. I’d love to hear your thoughts and if you think I made a decent choice here. The company is none other than Brighter Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM) and specializes mainly in child care and daycare centers.


Some quick facts right off the bat. The company has a PE of just under 40 and pays no dividend. It has a roughly 5.75 billion dollar market cap and its listed stock price has increased roughly 30% in the past year. It experienced a 10% Growth in revenue from Q1 of the previous year while having exceeded earnings estimates several quarters in a row.


Net Income, however, decreased 9% from the Q1 of the previous year. The changes in tax law were actually a main cause behind this as despite the decrease in federal taxes paid, the company’s tax benefits weren’t as significant. The tax law changes have kind of threw off a lot of company’s financial figures so it’s tough to say just how much of an impact the new changes will ultimately have and how companies will adjust (for better or worse).


Now, why does this company draw my attention? The first is that it offers a unique sense of diversification similar to how REITs can. Childcare and daycare is unique in that for many it’s a necessity in today’s world. With baby boomers working and retiring later than their parents had, it makes it harder for younger adults to have their parents babysit their children. This leads to the question of paying for daycare or having one spouse stay at home. For many careers, taking time off can be a killer and major delay in career advancement. To add to the debate, many companies do not offer paid time or things like maternity leave making the decision even more difficult. During mighty bull market or brutal bear markets, parents need someone to look after their kids while they work.


While the almost unavoidable problem of child daycare and the growing cost of it, a company like this should benefit from raising costs in the sector. Whether parents pay directly or companies pay, the business should profit. Right now in the US, we really don’t have an answer for daycare and this isn’t a problem that is likely to go away anytime soon as it hasn’t received too much floor time on tv or political debates despite how ridiculously expensive daycare can be. I can’t really see any new law being implemented anytime soon that could change things and negatively impact a company like this.


The growing debate of importance of early education and parents willing to pay to top dollar for daycare centers offering unique and trustworthy care. This company certainly caters to upper middle class and high income parents hoping to find the best care possible for their kids. Simply put, it parents have the money they aren’t shy paying top dollar for their child’s education and care. This company tries to sell itself as offering tremendous early childhood education and social interaction.


The company has over 1,000 centers in several countries around the world. They specialize mainly in child daycare but also offer support and services in things like college coaching, workforce training/consulting, elderly care, and special needs care. I think daycare can be a big money maker but I’m curious to see how their elderly care sector will work out as it has massive potential if done correctly (which has proven difficult for many in the sector). The diversity in not only sectors but countries should prove beneficial.


The company has solid reviews from both a client and employee perspective. They were listed by Fortune magazine as a top 100 company to work for and as one of Colorado’s top workplaces to work for going into 2018 by the Denver Post. Most reviews online of the company are positive and there are no bad stories or articles when you google their name. While reviews should often taken with a gain of salt and looked at carefully, I think they still play an important part. This company doesn’t have any nightmare stories or major issues that can often plague companies involved in things like childcare or nursing homes for example.


I don’t think this company is a stock one would hold looking for a quick and easy gain. Instead it reminds me a little of a company like Visa in that it’s one of those companies that doesn’t have huge swings day to day or week to week but that you look say one year later and realize how well it’s performed. Obviously the two are totally different companies and on different scales but hopefully my comparison makes sense.


Normally I’d say wait until a dip to buy unless you absolutely love a company and have major hopes but if you look at this stock’s history there really hasn’t been too many major dips and buying opportunities. I do feel it is priced fairly reasonable in this current market environment so wouldn’t argue against buying in now. Of course past performance doesn’t equal future performance but if you’re looking for a company with pretty consistent performance this isn’t a bad pick in my view.


After looking at what both analysts and the company itself have stated, the view is that revenue should continue growing around 8-10% per year but the rate of growth should remain relatively consistent, possibly slightly lessening. For a small-mid cap company this isn’t ideal but for the type of sector this company is involved in I’d also argue its both realistic and feasible.


So what do you guys think? Right move here that just require some patience or did I miss the boat here and am perhaps missing something? Somewhere in between?


Would also like to state for what it’s worth, I do own shares of this company and have a positive long term outlook for them.


Thanks!

plusgarbage;1526722324;8kk8bu;;4;;2;Here I am. I want to invest but due to lack of knowledge of the market (and time) I have never managed to do it. The only thing I did was buy 10 AMD shares a few months ago and sell them for a profit of 16 euros (yes, I'm European). I have read that for those who have little time and little knowledge of the market, they should invest in the index funds. If I invest in an index fund with 0.07% of fees per year, how does it work? that is, suppose I bought 100 shares of some index. 0.07% of fees refers to the annual profit obtained from the index? (Dividends?). This is a first question. The second is this: I am very ignorant about the economy and the market and I would like to learn by reading some good books that give me a solid foundation. I've already read some books like that of Bogle, but I think they are already for people with economic bases. I would like to better understand how stocks work, how to calculate interest and so on.

exgerex;1526917353;8l1rit;;3;;2;"Hello, 

I just wanted to give some advice to people looking for energy stocks to purchase and or sell. Also a full disclaimer I do own or have owned the stocks I am about to list

GE- let me say that this stock is trash and if you own it I would abandon it. This is a backwards flip from my previous veiws after doing some digging. The main reason I am no longer a fan of this company is because of its debt. It carries some of the largest debt in the industry and if interest rates pick up (which they are) they are going to be unable to maintain a cash flow to handle all there obligations. I would recomend buying it only when it hits $12-$12.5 range until then it is a high risk investment with little upside. The company needs to abandon its dividend to take care of its obligations.

RIG- This is a stock I absolutely love. Why because it is volatile in a good way. This is a oil stock with its roots in deepwell mining. It also pays a great dividend and after the collapse of oil they were able to restructure and gather more assets to take advantage of the new increase in oil. Now if you believe oil is going on the wayside dont buy this. However, i believe oil is going to keep rising due to the many geopolitic issues that are driving demand up and supply down. Also now that the US is a exporter it is recomended to look at stocks like BP, EXXON, and OXY. 

CEO- everything listed above but this is an chinese based oil company. And it is and is going to be an oil powerhouse for a long time. As we are witnessing right now China is a huge powerhouse player that rivals American corporations and laughs at the attempts to impose tarriffs on it. Also with chinas ever growing population and the acces to a 1/3 of the worlds population in its backyard they have a plenty of ways to develope growth. The biggest concern i have for China is that like America it has a baby boomer surge, but theirs is way worse and I feel in the next 20 years their aging population is going to put a huge strain on their economy. But until then this is a great stock. 

OGZPY- This one has hit some recent snags but still has the potential to explode. This a a Russian own natural gas company. It currently pays a 6% dividend yeild and the Oligarch essentially has a monopoly on the natural gas market in the region. They are also pouring money into infastructure for distribution. Some would call it a value trap but even with the dividend alone it is a good buy, because all the fundamentals are there. 


So there are a few suggestions. Let me caveat all these with a couple piecea of advice. Stock in foreign countries have the dividen tax that does cut into gains a little. However, my biggest concerns are with the governments themselves. Since the US really has no control of them they have the potential to be very volatile due to the host country mingling in them and it is a risk I am willing to take until we see some real tension between countries build. 

Also the energy sector is high but i wouldnt recomend these if I didnt think it would go higher. I have a huge portion of my portfolio in them because i bought them during their crash and i would continue to buy but at a slower pace.";238139;Energy sector suggestions for yoh;

provoko;1527005448;8lb6h9;;65;;411;"I wrote this long comment answering OP, but before I got the chance he deleted it, but here's what I had to say:


Use a screener like finviz. Look for companies that have sales q/q 30% or more and gross margin over 40% (ideally over 80%, but new stocks closer to their IPO might have extremely low gross margin, but if they can keep growing their sales and EPS, then gross margin will improve and the stock price will keep rising). FB had phenomenal fundamentals for almost the entire time it's been trading publicly.

EPS q/q should be positive, but it depends, sometimes high growth means spending a lot in the beginning, but if this is an old stock, years after IPO, then stay way from negative EPS growth, old companies should have 15 to 30% EPS growth Q/Q like ZNGA. If it's reverse, negative sales and positive EPS and negative ROI like GPRO, you know something is wrong.

Look for market caps over $2 billion and don't be tempted in buying micro caps (under $300 million).

Lastly institutional ownership below 75%, if it's already over, it could still be a good stock, but you're looking for smaller companies that institutions haven't completely gobbled up yet; same is true for large stocks. Institutional buying is like fuel that keeps stocks going. Likewise, don't bother with near 100% institutional ownership since those stocks will just get sold off by institutions when the stock goes through bad times, Pandora comes to mind when it was completely owned by institutions.

Kane97;1527007315;8lbf66;;7;;0;"So I know investing on Margin can be risky if you're not careful. I personally don't use margin on extremely volatile companies. I don't use it to make a quick buck either. However, I do use it when I don't have the cash to get into really fundamentally strong companies on the Russell 2000 that I like. Generally small and mid caps since it's the Russell and occasionally I'll get into a large cap. 

The way I view margin is it gives me the necessity to keep adding to my account. To one, pay off the margin so the rates don't cause me to lose too much money in interest and also to keep the wheel turning in my portfolio. I generally have my margin paid off within 1\-2.5 months after using it and then the cycle begins again. This approach has allowed me to get to a 45K portfolio in only a year and a half.

That’s largely due to the banks powerful low cost growth story, with an efficiency ratio of 32% (operating costs = 32% of revenues)  about half that of bricks and mortar banks, meaning it can charge borrowers less and still pay better returns to depositors and stock holders. 

Despite the stock price appreciation it still trades on a very reasonable PE of 18 with the outlook being for 20% annual earnings growth.  Additionally the bank has plenty of room for growth.

ACCESSWIRE	ACCESSWIRE•May 21, 2018
BELGRADE, MT / ACCESSWIRE / May 21, 2018 / Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: XTNT), a leader in the development of regenerative medicine products and medical devices, announces U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for InTice™-C Porous Titanium Cervical Interbody System.

InTice-C is designed using OsteoSync Ti, a best-in-class, cost-effective, highly porous titanium scaffold material for improved implant fixation. The material more closely resembles the bioscaffold of cancellous bone, and further combines Xtant Medical's hardware and biologic portfolios. In addition to InTice-C serving as a bioactive scaffold, it is also cleared for use with Xtant's proprietary allograft lines, including OsteoSponge®, 3Demin® Cortical Fibers, and OsteoVive™ viable cell allograft.

""InTice-C represents Xtant's latest addition to our spinal implant portfolio and is our first spinal implant to be engineered using a best-in-class porous titanium material,"" stated Dr. Gregory Juda, Chief Scientific Officer and General Manager of Xtant Medical. ""The porous architecture of the titanium was designed to improve implant fixation, both prior and post fusion. We expect a positive reception of this technology from our surgeon customers in the cervical spine market.""

The InTice-C Is designed to provide cervical intervertebral body fusion options for each patient's varied anatomy. It is offered in multiple footprint, height and endplate options. The commercial pure titanium structure offers continuous pore interconnectivity from the top to the bottom as well as from the outer perimeter to the large central graft cavity of the implant. This optimizes vascularization to the fusion site allowing the implant to be a participant in the fusion process. The implant utilizes machined endplate structures in conjunction with the inherent texture of the porous titanium to provide migration resistance. The implant is offered in individual sterile packages. InTice-C was developed in collaboration with Sites Medical.

InTice-C will help the Company further penetrate the $285 million dollar cervical spine market. Xtant's other cervical interbody options include Calix®-C, Calix-C PC, Atrix-C®, and Irix®-C, which offer PEEK, PEEK with a plasma-coated titanium, a structural biologic solution, and a standalone cervical option, respectively.

Signs abound that the Trump administration plans to take tough action against pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, including CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) and Express Scripts Holding Company (NASDAQ:ESRX), in order to lower the price of prescription drugs.

Even though their 2017 stats show a loss of about 6.9b their products are quickly overtaking their competitors in different markets \- mostly Asian atm. Though their presence can be seen in Europe I don't know the statistics. Moreover, their total revenue rose for about 67&amp;#37; \(up to around 15b eur\) compared to 2016 where they were still making profit.

They have a fan base, a ""diversified"" product portfolio \(rice cookers to smartphones\) and they are seemingly innovative. Their products are also very affordable, so extra points for potential future popularity.

The IPO is expected to be huge and will be used for overseas development and R&amp;D.

Consumer staples is the easiest to see it in, as companies like KHC, JNJ, PG, etc are all down &gt;10% over the last year.

My friend and I were discussing averaging down and he suggested something I didn't consider or was even aware of. 

He said, instead of buying stocks that have fallen in price to reduce your weighted average; why don't I sell my stocks at a loss and then buy them back at the reduced price in order to reduce my average cost? He also mentioned the advantages of having a smaller weighted average, that you're guaranteed maximum gains.

I disagreed because why would I consider selling my stocks at loss just to reduce my average cost, not to mention this being very risky? I could just buy them at the reduced price instead, especially if the company is strong and people are just panic-selling due to overhyped news.

Any thoughts on this?


TL;DR: selling your stocks at a loss, and then buy them back at a reduced price, in order to reduce your weighted average.

FuninUSA;1527306533;8m7kgi;;1;;0;"It’s reported that Apple is providing software for automaker partner Volkswagen recently after it readjusts its self-driving dream, resigning to work with Volkswagen after earlier negotiations with several automakers fell through — in part because Apple was hesitant to relinquish control over the vehicle design.

To interpret this cooperation, in addition to consider it as Apple’s self-driving car ambitions around vehicle design, investors could also view Apple's new Volkswagen partnership as another investment in the hardware giant's growing services business, written in FuninUSA. Apple is leaving money on the table by failing to capitalize on the growing subscription economy. A long-term self-driving software play might make up the difference.

Apple's software and services segment — the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Pay, iTunes and cloud services — has been a particular growth point for the iPhone maker in recent years. 

Morgan Stanley said this week that the market is undervaluing Apple's services business, predicting the company's services business will represent 67 percent of Apple's sale growth in the next five years, according to report in FuninUSA.

""The concept of an autonomous service is a departure from Apple's current hardware and content services business,” said venture capitalist Gene Munster. “Specifically, delivering their experience through third party hardware is a strategy that Apple rarely employs,"" Munster added. Apple will finally partner their way to autonomy. Any resulting Apple-Volkswagen vehicle, Munster said, is likely to yield an ""Apple-like experience,” reported in FuinUSA.

""Autonomy is one component of optionality that is currently not reflected in Apple's share price along with AR, original content, and health,"" Munster also said.";239004;Market is undervaluing Apple’s service business: Apple’s self-driving partnership may be the next step of Apple’s service;

It might sound odd for banks to be deregulated now, when they are [reporting record profits](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-banks-report-record-first-quarter-profit-1526999856)and the highest rates of return since 2007, just before the last crisis.

In fact, that’s typical. “Regulation gets tighter after busts because people say, ‘We don’t want to have another financial crisis,’ and then it loosens during booms as the bankers complain that the rules are too stringent or just find ways around them,” says Richard Sylla, a financial historian at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “This has been going on in the U.S. since the very beginning.”

Use 5m chart and draw a trendline for the CURRENT trend. If/when price pulls back to that trendline, you take a long/short IF PRICE moves in the direction of the trendline. (I.E. If it's a long trendline price goes long after pulling back to trendline)
Use a 200 EMA. BUT the ema is there as a no fly zone, so if price is near or on the 200 ema you don't trade, period.

As earnings season continues, one thing is becoming clear: tech is king.

Coming into Q1 releases, conventional wisdom was that sectors such as energy and financials would be the big winners. Tech, on the other hand, had largely led the moves down over the last couple of months, and was not often mentioned as a place to be. Energy earnings are, as expected, showing tremendous growth, which is hardly surprising if you so much as glance at a chart showing oil prices, while early in the season most financial firms did reveal the expected increase in trading profits.

The headline grabbers, however, have been in tech, and especially big tech.

The big four, Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOGL), collectively known as the FANG stocks, have all reported EPS beats, ranging from a penny in the case of Netflix to a massive 168% upside surprise from Amazon. Now that we have all their earnings, it is time to take stock, if you’ll forgive the pun.

Anyways, I almost sold quite a lot of it when It peaked a few weeks ago, It was right around $78 a share, highest its been in, well, ever I think. Then It took quite the dip recently and seems to slowly be getting lower and lower. I have close to 500 shares, and my gain is right around 148% since I started buying them early.

 The S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled (up 194% to be exact) since its low point on March 9, 2009. The surge reflects America's recovery from the Great Recession.

Yet the bull run has slowed considerably, especially in 2016. Stocks started the year with a scary plunge that was fueled by fears of a new global recession and worries about the downsides of cheap oil. Some even feared the bull market was near its death bed.

""The more fun part of the bull market is probably over,"" said Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock. ""It doesn't mean stocks can't advance. But the gains are going to be more muted -- and accompanied by more volatility."" 

 Still, the market freakout of 2016 highlights the serious challenges facing the bull market as it grows older.

After soaring 30% in 2013 and 11% the next year, the S&amp;P 500 was basically flat in 2015. Not only has the market stopped smashing records, it's down 7% from its May all-time highs.

Seven may not sound very old, but in stock-market years it's practically senior-citizen status. Only two bulls have lived longer, led by the nine-year run that ended in March 2000.

""Time to buy the bull an AARP membership,"" jokes Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indexes.

In some ways, this bull market anniversary should carry an asterisk. That's because the record books may actually need to be amended if a bear market (20% decline from previous highs) happens soon.

Thump604;1527703540;8naruy;;5;;1;"Hi All,
Aside from a 401K with fidelity I have 3 core accounts with TD.  Individual(larger than Roth), Roth(smallest) and traditional IRA(largest). Aside from getting into options, I have tried many strategies.  I gave dedicated day trading once and lost my ass.  So, I have been been doing the active trading and learning about active vs passive and had TD manage a portion of my IRA for a few months.  I stopped that because I think I can accomplish the same sort of approach without paying them.  I'm not really lazy and so I'm willing to put in some work, but this is where I get to my question.   These are what I hold positions on now.   You will see I have some positions on stocks that I am just waiting to dump, but is it sill our counter productive to have this sort of mix with small positions spread around or should I be consolidating into just a few.  I have a feeling a got a little carried away with diversifying and the passive approach. My current thought process was to transition both IRA's to passive with an occasional re balance and keep the individual for various short terms plays.

FuninUSA;1528044317;8o9t2l;;9;;0;"In the past several months, the related news about Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk alarmed some investors. But lately, shares were up about 2 percent on the news that Consumer Reports had reversed its previous position.

And if you invested in Tesla in 2010, when it made its initial public offering, that investment could have paid off, too, according to the report in FuninUSA, a platform which provides product-reviews and global news. Based on the professional calculation, a $1,000 investment in the company would be worth more than $12,000 so far, or over 12 times as much, including price appreciation and dividend gains reinvested.

However, many analysts are still bearish after the company's earnings call, even labeling Musk's behavior a red flag. Still, Tesla executives, among other industry analysts, are generally optimistic about the company's future. ""To ensure that Tesla is well prepared for the future, we have been undertaking a thorough reorganization of our company,"" Musk wrote in a statement to employees.

If you're considering investing in Tesla or in the stock market in general, experts advise starting slow, reported in FuninUSA. Experienced investors Warren Buffett, Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins suggest beginning with index funds, which hold every stock in an index, offer low turnover rates, attendant fees and tax bills, and fluctuate with the market to eliminate the risk of picking individual stocks.

I was wondering if someone might be able to tell me how I can find out if I have an old piece of paper or if the certificate of shares I found is worth anything.

BuzzingStocks;1528262903;8oy2vj;Advice;0;;2;"Are you holding any delisted shares? How to deal with such delisted shares in online stock trading? Delisting of shares is a complex process and you also need to follow certain guidelines to tender shares.

## So, what is all about delisted shares?

Delisted shares mean it will not be available for online stock trading in exchanges. Normally a company delists from stock exchanges due to expansion, restructuring, or when acquired by other company. Delisting can be done voluntarily if the company decides to delist its shares from stock exchanges. If there is any compliance issue not fulfilled then stock exchanges can forcefully delist the stocks.

If you are one of those investors who stuck and wants to exit from delisted shares then don't worry. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Delisting of Securities) Regulations, 2009 provide an exit mechanism to you if you hold any delisted shares.

## How can you deal with delisted shares?

The exit price is determined through the Reverse Book Building process by a company when they announced voluntary delisting. As a shareholder, you have to make a bid at a price either on or above the floor price. The exit price would be decided on the basis of bidding by the public shareholders like you. If the exit price is accepted by the promoter of the delisted company, then they pay you the exit price.

If you do not participate in the Reverse Book Building process you can offer shares for sale to the promoters. The promoters can accept the shares at the same exit price. This facility is only available for one year from the date of closure of the delisting process. So, if you have any delisted shares then make an offer for sale before one year.

If a small company decides to voluntary delist from stock exchanges, then promoter can finalize the exit price in consultation with their merchant banker. However, a company with paid\-up capital of less than Rs. ten crore and net worth less than Rs. Twenty\-five crores don't require to follow the reverse book building process. In addition, if companies equity shares have not been traded on for a period of one year can also skip reverse book building process.

It doesn't matter whether a company listed on more than one stock exchange as it has to provide you exit offer. If a company delisted shares from a stock exchange but continues to remain listed on another exchange it doesn't require to provide an exit opportunity to you.

## How you tender delisted shares?

In case you hold equity shares in a Demat form you may tender it through your stockbroker. You can do so by indicating the details of equity shares to be tendered under the delisting offer.

Recently Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) compulsorily delist 200 companies and also ban promoters for 10 years from accessing the stock market. As per SEBI delisting regulations, promoters of these delisted companies will be required to buy the shares from the public shareholders. The exit price will be as per the fair value determined by the independent valuer appointed by the BSE.";241343;How To Deal With Delisted Shares In Online Stock Trading?;

Vaeliss;1528315399;8p3vd6;;14;;4;"Hi, just wanted to share something I was thinking, I really want to hear your opinions and tell me where my reasoning is flawed. So here it goes..

I've always heard sentences like ""you're young, you can take risks in investments"" or ""as you get older you switch to safer investments"".
I kinda get it, I have plenty of time to make money back in case something goes wrong if I'm young..
 But.. compounding effect lose importance as you get older, so the earliest you invest your money in ""safe"" long term bets (sp500 etf for example) the most you'll get out of it, I feel like every dollar you earn while in your twenties is worth a lot long term, so why risk it? On the other side as you get older might aswell invest in riskier stuff with the fresh money you get, if you managed to set up a good amount of money in ""safe"" long term stuff when you were younger, your money has less time to compound anyway and there are always opportunities.

 So wouldn't it be more logical to invest your paychecks in progressively riskier stuff as you grow older and be really conservative with your investments early on? ";241508;Age and risk;

In Feb 2018 the lowest is about $156. Many people believe it is a low point to buy, which is right because it is $190 in June 2018.

In June 2018 it is $190, most people tell you to sell or hold but not many people tell you to strong buy. If the stock go to $220 in 2019 $190 is consider low.

I am looking into the CXO which is a US domestic shale oil producer. At the moment, CXO is trying to acquire another shale oil producer RSPP. CXO had a strong Q1 and their P/E is relatively low (around 20, which is below the industry).  I read some reports about the cost shale oil per barrel is around $40 on average for US shale producer and current oil price is at $65. I would shale oil production will remain profitable even if OPEC raises supply or US domestic producers add more supply.

New trader here looking to swing trade stocks. Not sure if I'm understanding position sizing correctly... assume $10,000 account for the example. The book I'm going through recommends risking 2% maximum and looking for profit objectives between 2-5%.

If I go long on a stock with $2500 and risk $200, a 5% profit would only give me $125, making my reward to risk ratio well under 1. How is it possible to get 2:1 or 3:1 trades? Are 2-5% price swings just not ideal for swing trading? Thanks for the help!";242487;How to increase reward-risk ratio?;

The general trade\-off with such a move is that ad pricing falls while ad impressions rise, with the advertising company hoping that the extra volume will make up for lower prices.

Overall /investing and /stocks are bullish on Visa, and the stock has done extremely well in this bull market. It seems like there's tremendous growth in the payment processing realm, due to impending global transition from cash to electronic transfers.

BornOfAMammal;1528839669;8qmxf8;Resources;3;;2;"In April I had a lot of downtime due to illness, so I finally read a book that's been on my shelf a long time: ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" by William O'Neil, the founder of Investor's Business Daily.

I read it because I've had a sizable increase in my 401(k) in recent years and didn't want to give it up in the inevitable coming recession.  I knew from browsing this book in the past that it had information about the signs to look for.

But after reading through it, I got the feeling that my 401(k) really wasn't performing all that well.  So I decided to try to use the system from the book (CANSLIM) to see how well it compared.  My 401(k) allows me to set up an account within it to manage any amount of the money myself.  I did that and transferred 10&amp;#37; of my funds into it.  I also signed up for the free trial period of Investor's Business Daily to see how much it would help.

The results for the first month have been solid.  I started outpacing the S&amp;P 500 within the first few days and have beaten it most days.  After taking out the contributions I and my employer have made to my 401(k) during the period, I'm still up 5.77&amp;#37; for the month vs 2.17&amp;#37; for the S&amp;P 500 (vs 2.3&amp;#37; for the rest of my 401(k)).  I've done enough playing around in the market in the past to know those kinds of returns may very well not be sustainable, but at least it's enough to make me consider managing more of my 401(k) myself.

For auditing purposes, here are the stocks I worked with during this time.  I only purchased full shares, no options.

By the way, I consider IBD's basic subscription to be worth the cost.  They condense all of the CANSLIM principles down into just a few numbers you can use to narrow down your watch list considerably.  The add\-on services seem too pricey to me, though, and really only save you a little homework you should probably be doing yourself anyhow.

I'd be happy to answer any questions anyone has, if I can.

Historically, crude oil prices and the S&amp;P 500 index have influenced each other. Crude oil (USO) prices have been falling since June 2014. The correlation of the S&amp;P 500 index and crude oil was highest when crude fell below $30, and lowest when crude oil was at around $100.

Oil is an important driver of the world economy. Energy demand constitutes a significant portion of US consumer spending. Equities and crude oil move in a cycle. A sudden rise in prices pressurizes consumer spending and strains economic growth in consuming nations. On the other hand, a sudden fall in crude oil prices could indicate a slowdown in economic activity. Plus, a sharp drop in crude oil prices could affect other industries that support it, employment in the sector, and the financial sector that lends to it.

Do you think this correlation between S&amp;P 500 sales growth and the oil price will continue for many years in the future?";243005;"S&amp;P 500 sales growth vs. oil price: year 2010 - 2018";

RedditerAlways;1528969058;8r0in1;;1;;2;"&gt;Social  trading works more or less like a social network. The only difference  is that instead of sharing selfies or lunch photos, on a trading network  people share trading ideas. Here traders interact, watch trading  results of other professionals and brainstorm on market situations in  real time.

As  an investor or less experienced trader, in social trading your  financial trading decisions are based on other skilled investors  generated financial content collected from various reliable platforms.  In other words, once you identify a successful trader and you like their  trading strategy, you can start following them and copy their trades.

#### What are the benefits of Social Trading?

Well, some of the benefits of Social Trading include:**·**   


***Quick access to reliable trading information***Social  Trading platforms cut down on the process of searching for reliable  trading information by providing extensive information from professional  traders across the world. You also get to interact with the skilled  traders on the platforms like one\-on\-one Tutorage.  


 ***Quick grasping of the trading market***Social  Trading platforms reduce the duration and cost of becoming a  professional investor by allowing you to learn from seasoned investors,  quickly and efficiently.  


***Earning while still learning***Social  Trading platforms allow you to learn from experienced investors, where  you get to know how to navigate the trading market and still earn some  money by copying their trades. Therefore you don’t have to wait until  you have all the required knowledge for you to start earning.  


***Build a trading community of investors***Social  trading platforms build a community of investors, where you get to  interact with other investors and share information, while also  collaborating on different ventures. It being an online platform, you  can access trading information from anywhere in the world quickly and  easily as long as you have the internet.

China’s economy fell short of expectations and its central bank chose not to follow the Federal Reserve in raising borrowing costs, adding fresh caution on the outlook for global growth as trade tensions with the U.S. escalate.

With President Donald Trump renewing threats to impose tariffs on the world’s second\-largest economy, May data for industrial output, retail sales and investment all came in beneath economist forecasts on Thursday. The People’s Bank of China kept the cost of reverse\-repurchase agreements steady, defying predictions it would track the Fed’s hike of Wednesday.

Investors now face greater uncertainty over what had been the strongest global upswing since 2011. That doubt is set to fester after Trump said on Wednesday that he’ll confront China ""very strongly"" over commerce in coming weeks. His administration is scheduled to announce a new list of duties on Friday.

""A slowing China will add to the challenges for the global economy,"" said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong and a former International Monetary Fund researcher. ""Until recently, the resilience of growth in China was an important buffer for the global economy in the face of headwinds from trade friction, slower growth in Europe, higher oil prices and issues in various emerging markets.""

Both industrial output and retail sales rose less than expected in May compared to a year ago. Fixed\-asset investment growth in the first five months was the slowest since the data began in 1999, as was the investment in the services sector. The decade\-long decline in investment has intensified this year, as policy\-makers act to reduce leverage at state\-owned companies and local governments. While that’s a deliberate policy, officials risk a worse\-than\-desired deceleration in growth.

### Tit-For-Tat

China’s weaker performance comes amid a slew of mixed signals for the global economy. While the IMF sees robust global expansion of 3.9 percent this year and next, Managing Director Christine Lagarde last week warned that clouds on the horizon are getting [darker](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-06-11/lagarde-says-clouds-over-global-economy-are-darker-by-the-day) by the day. Topping the worry list are ongoing fears of protracted trade disputes between the U.S. and China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico.

China has promised to retaliate if the U.S. pushes ahead with plans to levy tariffs on $50 billion in imports, threatening an escalating, tit\-for\-tat trade war. At the same time, rising interest rates have jolted emerging markets, while fears of an Italian debt crisis have returned, along with worries over higher oil prices. A gauge of world trade devised by Oxford Economics Ltd. fell in May to its lowest level since early 2017.

China, which is the world’s second\-largest economy, is already slowing after a stronger\-than expected start to 2018, even before any new U.S. tariffs on its exports.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg see a 6.5 percent expansion this year after 6.9 percent in 2017, in line with the government’s own target. A gauge of early indicators developed by Bloomberg Economics in May showed some sectors of the economy slowing while others, buoyed by global trade, held up.";243178;Draghi Ends ECB Bond-Buying Era Saying Economy Can Beat Risks;

Jeremy_Edwards_20XX;1529028275;8r7eec;;4;;1;"My strategy is to squeeze trade on short term directional momentum. I prefer buying medium term options to lower the risk of the option expiring out of the money, and for the leverage of course. I also prefer buying options that are already in the money with strike prices at levels of strong support. I try to buy stocks that have good potential through the length of my option so that I have the choice of holding the contracts for a few weeks or months if I don’t want to exit the trade quickly. 

My current positions are:—

1. 6 contracts for $100 calls on Weibo (WB) expiring 19/10. Position was entered on June 13th for an average cost of $15.20. Current price as of COB June 14th is $17.90; unrealised PnL $1,560 (16.99&amp;#37;). 

The rationale for this position is that the market is eating up JPM’s upgrade of Twitter. I personally don’t like to buy a stock that moves as much as TWTR did just on the basis of a salesperson’s say-so, and I’m also pretty sure people like soccer in China too. I also think a lot of people turned to WB after they were done buying TWTR. WB is 100&amp;#37; safely moated behind the Chinese government and is not going anywhere in the medium term. It is also posting very healthy growth numbers, as would be suggested by its very strong performance in the last couple of years. Still, I think the stock is overvalued, and that long-term prospects aren’t that great since they will be likely limited to China, but I also think that a lot of stocks are overvalued *cough* Netf*lix c*ough. At $107, I can see the stock trading higher towards resistance at $130 at $140. There was also a bizarrely abrupt move to $130 a couple weeks ago, and now that the price has bounced off of strong support at $100 I can see attempts being made for $120 and $130 within the next month. Most importantly, TTM Squeeze indicates that WB is in a lull before volatility returns. RSI, MACD, and WaveABC indicate that volatility is more likely to be to the upside. 

2. 10 contracts for $5 calls on Corbus Pharmaceuticals (CRBP) expiring 19/10. Position was entered on June 13th for an average cost of $1.75. 

The rationale for this position is that CRBP is close to, but above, major support at $5.50. The stock is neutrally poised in my opinion and a move back below $6 is as likely as a move towards $7. That being said, the stock has spent a lot of time above its current price in the last few months and has a decent amount of volatility within a well defined range between $5.50 and $10. 

My plan tomorrow is to watch how WB opens. If the open is higher than today’s close, I will let the trade run for another day so long as the stock stays above $109. My expectation is that the stock will trade between $110-115 since resistance at $110 was taken pretty convincingly today. If the open is lower, then I will sell my position and monitor WB. MACD is approaching 0 while RSI is approaching recent highs. I am not convince the stock will not retest $100 in the short term, so I would prefer to take my money off of the table until TTM Squeeze indicates a bullish move. 

I am probably going to sell most if not all of my CRBP position at a loss of around 9&amp;#37; tomorrow. Although I think the position will pay off, the opportunity cost of having capital tied up in the trade does not make me want to wait around for a move to happen. 

Watchlist:

Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrup Gruman (NOC) are getting hammered by the positive developments with DPRK. I doubt the stock’s valuation is going to be significantly affected by a reduction in the long-term threat from DPRK, but if people are making money selling war stocks then I want to too. LMT looks like it might retest $300 (down $10) but NOC looks like a better option to retest $300 (down $25). 

Canon (CAJ) looks like it is touching support and is primed to bounce back. Travelers (TRV), Fomento Economico (FMX), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) are also under the microscope.

So I admit I don't know how to interpret these fears, I feel like I've always seen the click bait, year after year about how everything was going to crash.   But now that I'm in the game, I'm paying a bit more attention.

What I have a hard time wrapping my mind around, is the why of the fear mongering?  Part of me wants to believe it, because I want to remain risk adverse, I've decided at the time to sit on more cash and not put it in the market.

Yet I'm also skeptical, I know a lot of youtubers and 'infulencers' always have an angle or ulterior motivate but I don't know what that would be?  Because aren't they in a way encouraging people to not put money in and thus hurting liquidity?  What would be the angle here if you're fear mongering about the next great bear market and advising people to stay in mostly cash, what's the profit incentive on that?

I know some of these folks sell classes or books, but in my own mind that there be more incentive to try and keep as much dumb money in the market as long as possible.

I exited both my Weibo (WB) &amp; Corbus Pharmaceutical (CRBP) positions at the market open:—

1. Sold 6x $100 calls on WB expiring 19/10 for $17.20. Trade duration 2 days. PnL $1,200 (+13.2&amp;#37;).

WB was trading down $2 in pre-market around $109. I sold the early bounce back to $111 as trading opened. I am neutral short term (1-7 days) on WB and will reassess once TTM Squeeze indicates the stock is firing.

1. Sold 10x $5 calls on CRBP expiring 19/10 for $1.65. Trade duration 2 days. PnL -$100 (-5.7&amp;#37;).

CRBP was flat pre-market and I wanted to redeploy capital into other trades.

In terms of the watchlist for today, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northtrup Gruman (NOC) showed some early strength, perhaps because long-term investors view the recent pull back as a buying opportunity. The number of shorts on both stocks is small and I think the short opportunity after the Kim meeting has largely fired already. NFLX, TSLA, and TWTR all seemed to show some early weakness, but it looked deceptive. BMY was flattish in early trading, but is now firing.

I opened two new positions shortly after the bell in Invacare Corporation (IVC) and Axovant Sciences (AXON):—

In my research last night, I read a short analysis of IVC by Baptista Research. The suggested timeframe for the short was 2-3 months, but after looking at the graph I decided it was more suitable as a day trade. Price is above the long-term trend line on the weekly chart, and as the stock approached the $120 level it also began to touch the top of the medium-term downward channel. Moreover, looking at the daily and hourly charts, RSI indicated that the stock was overbought in both timeframes. For these reasons, I strongly believed the stock was entering the downward leg of its bimonthly cycle, which I expect to find support between $16-17 within the next 5 weeks. This time I went with a lower, short-term strike ($20) that was just in the money in order to increase the risk profile of the trade.

1. 50x $4 puts on AXON expiring 17.8 for $0.90. Price at COB $0.78; unrealised PnL -$600 (-13.3&amp;#37;).

I also read a short analysis of AXON by Edward Vranic. The stock appears to be in a large correction on the daily chart after an overly-bullish reaction to good news. I didn’t like my entry price and should have bought at $0.85.

My current plan for tomorrow is to cut the AXON trade if momentum does not move to the downside in early trading. Although positive today, price action was rather weak and I think a fall lower is still likely. There is some chance that the stock will go above $4 before it goes beneath $3, however, so if it doesn’t move early I’m out.

I will also exit my position in IVC in early trading if the price does not fall towards $19. The stock could be making room in its RSI for a push above $20, similar to the price action that occurred in early June. I would prefer to re-enter the trade when the stock is beneath $19 when we have more confirmation that the short-term upward trend of the stock has been broken.

All indicators are that Model 3 production targets will be exceeded, profitability shown (despite enormous capex), exponential growth in energy storage business and significant partnerships announced -- confirmation in about 3 weeks (Q2 2018 earnings).       

Recent positive news has already seen shares pop. Kinks are being rapidly ironed out of manufacturing lines. A gigafactory in China is to be formally announced. More to come. Elon Musk has been tweeting regularly discussing progress and has not been afraid to admit mistakes as he swiftly corrects them. The whole process has been transparent.      

I don't see Tesla shares falling below $400 after Q2 2018 earnings pop, unless a GFC-like event happens and wipes the entire market. Yeah, it'll still be a volatile stock (such is the case for any company innovating as much and as often) but Model 3 is Tesla's ""coming of age"" moment and consistency in production volume is about to be achieved.          

Tesla is the most shorted stock in the US. Shorts are about to burn, causing a huge **short squeeze** and thrusting the stock price into new territory.      
   
If you're short, please do your research and then, if you agree with my conclusions, cut your losses (or face a world of pain).              

I've never felt the need to post something like this nor had to confidence to make such a call but I have had my finger on the pulse of Tesla and the wider industries it is involved in for YEARS. I'm also a business man. I feel bad for everyone who is short. This is going to be a tipping point and carnage will ensue IMO.

Based on investment, Google and Jd.com will collaborate on a number of strategic projects. The two sides said that the core areas of cooperation at this stage are to provide retail solutions in the global market, provide products through Google Shopping and create a more convenient Shopping experience online and offline. The first markets to be targeted are southeast Asia, US, and Europe.

JD.com’s chief strategy officer Liao Jianwen said that the cooperation with Google opened up broad space for innovation, which enables JD.com to create high-quality consumer experience for global consumers. This is a significant step in the modernization process of global retail.

Google’'s chief commercial officer Philipp Schindler expressed the willingness to cooperate with JD.com, jointly explore to provide new solutions to global retail ecosystem, and provide consumers with valuable, personalized, and convenient shopping experience, letting the consumers can shop in their preferred ways anywhere at any time .

Obviously, both sides have their own purposes in this cooperation, written in FuninUSA news. Jd.com hope to expand its overseas market shares by copying the Chinese market mode (including supply chain management, purchasing and logistics, etc.)  For Google, it hopes to explore deeply in e-commerce field, thus against Amazon’'s growing e-commerce business and product search. The cooperation is conducive for Google to compete for the voice interaction market in the field of e-commerce field in the future. Google officials said Google Shopping has already had lots of partners: more than 50 retailers and distributors around the world, including Walmart, Target and Carrefour.

Finally,  when asked whether both sides of the data will be shared with each other in the future, Google said that the protection of users’ privacy is the first priority. Google will give users the right to control their own data and will not sell or share users’ personal info to anyone. Jd.com also promised that jd.com has strict rules on protecting users' privacy and security, and will not share users' personal info with any partners.";244113;See how the Chinese media interprets Google’s investment on Chinese e-commerce player JD.com: ONE for Global expansion, ONE for fighting Amazon;

During the longest bull market in modern history, the S&amp;P 500 surged a whopping 418% over the 9.5 years between November 1990 and March 2000.


This was during the famous economic expansion that took place during the Clinton era, in which job growth was robust, oil prices fell, stocks soared, and making money was as easy as throwing it in the stock market.


In mere months, this famed bull market may lose its title as the “longest” in the modern era.


That’s because, according to data and analysis from LDL Research, the current bull market will take over the claim to fame in late August 2018.

By looking at duration, total rate of return, and annualized rate of return, it really gives a sense of how these bull markets compare.

The current run, which will soon become the longest, didn’t have the same level of intensity as other high-ranking bull markets. Critics would say that it was artificially propped up by ultra-low rates, QE, and other government actions that will make the market ultimately less robust heading forward.

Regardless, the current run ranks in fourth place among the markets above in terms of annualized return.

What Ended Each Bull?

The market psychology behind bull and bear markets can be fascinating.

Below we look at the events credited with “ending” each bull market – though of course, it is actually the actions of investors (buying or selling) that ultimately dictates market direction.

1. The Great Expansion
The bull run lasted 9.5 years, ultimately capitulating when the Dotcom Bubble burst. From the span of June 1999 and May 2000, the Fed raised interest rates six times to try and get a “soft landing”. Market uncertainty was worsened by the 9/11 attacks that occurred the year after.

2. The Post-Crisis Bull Run
Still ongoing…

3. The Post-War Boom
This boom occurred after WWII, and it ended in 1956. Some of the sources we looked at credited the launch of Sputnik, Eisenhower’s heart attack, and the Hungarian Revolution as possible sources of market fear.

4. That ’70s Growth
The Iranian Revolution, the 1979 Energy Crisis, and the return of double-digit inflation were the factors blamed for the end of this bull.

5. Reagan Era
This bull market had the highest annualized return at 26.7%, but the party came to an end on Black Monday in 1987 – one of the most infamous market crashes ever. Some of the causes cited for the crash: program trading, overvaluation, illiquidity and market psychology.

6. The Hot Aughts
Stocks did decently well during the era of cheap credit and rising housing prices. However, the Financial Crisis put an end to this growth, and would cut the DJIA from 14,000 points to below 6,600 points.

How long do you think the current bull market will continue?

anon1995help;1529348516;8s22w0;;4;;1;So I started investing mid-December so it’s been basically 6 months since I started. I have a regular brokerage account that contains mostly stocks, but also some mutual funds. And I have a Roth IRA that has primarily mutual/index funds. I have invested across both accounts and among different funds/stocks at various points throughout the past 6 months. My Rate of Return for my IRA is -2.2% while my brokerage has a +2.69%. Overall is +1.52%. So my concern is, is it reasonable given the past 6 months activity. And is it fair to still expect “+6-10% RoR” seeing as that’s what’s always thrown around as “expected growth of 30 years” I guess it’s just I’m worrying a bit but I know 6 months is short time period but I wanted some others’ opinions. Thanks :);244141;Is my rate of return reasonable?;

Jeremy_Edwards_20XX;1529354160;8s2tug;;0;;1;"It doesn't matter if you have a good plan if you don't execute it. I ended up with company last night and didn't check the market until 10am pacific. Since I wasn't at home and wouldn't be at my computer for another couple hours,  I ended up making some quick trading decisions on the fly. 

I sold my AXON puts at $0.90 for no loss. AXON has continued to fall through the day but the bid on the puts is still $0.90 with a mark of $0.98. 

IVC moved lower in the day too and reached $19.20 before rebounding to $19.60. I missed the moment to unload my puts at $1.20 (which would have been a realised PnL of 28&amp;#37;), and the spread has been super-wide ($0.6-$1.00) with almost no liquidity since IVC started moving higher (there as actually no bid at all for a few hours). The current mark is $0.78 (-8.24&amp;#37;). I am confident in the play still, although I think there is a pretty even chance that IVC will retest $20 in the coming days before moving lower again, so I am prepared to hold the puts towards the end of June. 

BMY opened significantly lower so I am waiting to see how price moves. WB opened significantly lower and CRBP is still stagnant, so I'm happy with how the timing of those trades worked out. 

In terms of watchlist for tomorrow, Platinum Analyst wrote a good fundamental short thesis for Cisco (CSCO) that includes a DCF valuation of $31.32 per share, a downside of 29&amp;#37; from current levels. CSCO's stellar stock performance is simply not matched by their growth rate and opportunities. Furthermore, [the short term DMA is beginning to cross the medium term DMAs](https://imgur.com/ybrdTTi), and [TTM Squeeze is indicating that the stock is getting ready to fire](https://imgur.com/tC4t9GE). Short interest in CSCO was also very limited last it was reported. This looks like an attractive setup technically and fundamentally, and I'll be looking to buy some medium-term puts tomorrow.

The WhaleIndex® tracks the highest-conviction stocks held by leading hedge fund managers. It is a long-only index that tracks the 100 most commonly held stocks disclosed on the quarterly 13F regulatory filings of consistently successful managers. The index is equal-weighted and rebalanced on a quarterly basis 46 days after the end of each quarter.

WhaleWisdom tracks all managers who file 13F regulatory filings with the SEC and ranks a select number of managers using the proprietary WhaleScore. To qualify for a WhaleScore, a manager must have the following attributes: between 5 and 750 holdings in their 13F filing, have at least 3 consecutive years of quarterly 13F filings, hold no fewer than five stocks in its portfolio, manage more than $100 million in marketable securities, and hold at least 20% of its portfolio in its top 20 stocks. Managers considered to be a bank, trust, pension, or insurance company are also excluded.

The top 60 managers who have maintained an average WhaleScore over the past year higher than the one-year average WhaleScore of the S&amp;P 500 is used in the WhaleIndex. Based on the holdings disclosed on their SEC filings, WhaleWisdom identifies the 100 stocks most commonly held among the respective managers' top 20 holdings.

If you haven't visited in a while, both the WhaleScore and resulting WhaleIndex were completely redesigned in June 2016. The redesign addressed limitations in the previous calculation and also corrected a look-ahead bias in the data being used. The redesign also changed the performance measures used to determine WhaleScores in order to achieve better performance. WhaleWisdom reserves the right to update/replace the WhaleScore and WhaleIndex at any time due to improvements in modeling and Alpha prediction.

venurie;1529465876;8sf5fi;;0;;1;"The end of financial year is often the time when most companies in Australia need to complete the dreaded stocktake. This also means it’s time for a comprehensive stocktake of the entire inventory. 
Whether you are counting stock in a warehouses across multiple locations, or “Out the back”, performing accurate and regular stocktake can greatly improve your bottom line. It is the fundamental task to attain the true picture of your company’s profitability. Finding inconsistencies between stock count and records is common regardless of the size of the business. One of the obvious reasons that stock can go missing is theft or loss. Differences in stocktake numbers can also occur due to damaged stock that’s been badly transported or stored incorrectly. By determining why the figures aren’t adding up at stocktake time, you can implement strategies to minimise or prevent these mistakes from happening again.  With the right information to hand, better decisions can be made for your business.
This year, make stocktake easier with one of these great barcode scanners. Use them for stocktake and then every day for all your transactions. 
Using a Barcode scanner can greatly speed up the stocktaking process, minimise errors and repeats as the stock taker only needs to aim at the barcode and in split seconds the barcode date is captured and entered. Once the information has been entered, it can be compared with existing spreadsheet or digital POS system to find discrepancies and update information accordingly. Due to greater accuracy and increased speed, using a barcode scanner when conducting stocktake is popular among small to medium businesses that have a moderate to large amount of stock. 
The general rule of thumb when doing a stocktake with the help of a barcode scanner is to “Divide and conquer”. And there are two ways that can be implemented when using this strategy. First is by diving stock by categories or by brands and running separate counts which is called a cycle counting. 
Second method is by diving the staff and provide extra scanners so everybody can work at once. This method can significantly reduce the time and burden of the stocktake making it easier to address any potential inconsistencies with inventory records. 
Have a look at the below Barcode Scanners we stock at Barcodes.com.au to help ease this year’s stocktake and then use them every day for all your transactions.

Features and Benefits OF using barcode scanners for Stocktake
• Easy to perform stocktakes.
• Integrates into your existing ERP.
• Communicates in batch and wireless connectivity modes for accurate and live reports on stock usage.
• Manages your stock rooms, ward store rooms and warehouses.
With the stocktake done and the numbers in, get the most out of your hard work at the same time. Use this data to change any inefficiencies and also to do a product performance review. It is also a great time to reflect on what worked well and didn’t work well with the stocktake so the next year stocktake will be much easier.  If you found this year’s stocktake stressful, have a look at setting up an inventory management system so help next year stocktake.

Instead of geopolitical and other issues of FED and ECB's current rate hike showing the growth of U.S economy as investors grapple with persistently strong corporate earnings and political/geopolitical headlines, among other factors.

Growth expectation, tax cut pushed the stock market higher in Q1 but as usual market uncertainties and risk factors led the market in a negative territory but the Technology and consumer discretionary showed positive quarters and remained scorecard leaders despite elevated valuations. the year-to-date return leaders technology and consumer discretionary continued to impress during the quarters with respectively 13.60% and 13.34% up.

Consumer discretionary:

Personal tax reform has benefited the consumer discretionary, in particular.  Consumer discretionary has outpaced the market in the vast majority of the time and its relative returns have been strong due to the reductions in personal tax rates, Netflix, Trip is the best YTD performing stocks in this sector.

And on the shock loss of major customer Uber, shares sunk to just $23. Now TWLO is on a roll again and the best YTD performing stock in information technology sector.

Whiting Petroleum Corporation shares are up more than 80.93% this year and recently increased by 2.42% or $1.13 to settle at $47.91.

Jeremy_Edwards_20XX;1529525934;8slm12;;0;;0;"Today was a busier trading day.   


I sold my 20 $63.50 June 20th calls on Walgreens (WBA) for $2.98 as the market opened. Including the 10 contracts I sold at $1.23 yesterday, the total PnL for the trade was **$3,866 (+115\%)**.  

The trade wasn't perfect. Price was very volatile at the open, and I sold my entire position when it would have been better to hold the last 10 contracts to the high. However, I am happy with the position I put myself in. This may seem like a lucky trade, but there were several decisions I made that led to this win. The first good decision was to scan the market for opportunities when nothing on my watchlist looked active. I only came across WBA because it was preparing to squeeze in the 15 minute chart. I usually swing trade, but the set-up favoured a day trade, so I bought the next option to expire with a strike very near the current price level. I was hoping to collect ten or maybe twenty cents and wanted to leverage up a bit. The thing about options that are just in the money and close to expiry is that the delta on them is almost 1, so for every penny WBA moved my options were moving $30. I took my 1/3 profit at \~10&amp;#37; and made the critical decision to let the remaining 20 contracts run. I also made a critical decision not to trade out of my position when it was clear that price was moving off the daily high, in order to see how the stock would close. In the last hour of trading WBA reversed again to the upside quite aggressively, and that gave me confidence to hold the contracts overnight to see if there were more gains to be made in the morning. I felt comfortable holding the contracts overnight because WBA usually opens around the same level it closes, so my options would very likely still be in the money the day before expiry. Those four decisions — to look for opportunities in the moment, to let the day trade run when it was up 10&amp;#37;, to let it run when it was clearly off the daily highs, and to let it run into the next morning — put me in a position to benefit from the good news after the close that Walgreens will replace GM in the Dow Jones index. It would have been nice to let the remaining 10 contracts run to the high today, but I'll learn my lesson. 

My puts on IVC are currently marked at $1.18 (unrealised return **$1,650.00; +38.82\%)** due to the massive spread between the bid at $0.85 (my entry price) and the ask at $1.55. IVC broke resistance at $19.25 and will trade lower in the coming days. This could end up being a big trade, if there's actually someone there at the end to buy my puts! 

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is in a daily squeeze, and when price moved to the upside again in early trading I bought 10 $42.50 August 17th calls for $2.77. They are currently marked at $2.84 (unrealised return **$100; +3.61\%)**.

Union Pacific Corp (UNP) was in a 15m squeeze, and trading near support for its recent cycle. I bought 5 $142 June 29th calls for $3.10. They are currently marked at $2.87 (unrealised return -**$160; -10.32\%)**. I expect the stock to consolidate as the 15m MACD reaches 0, and then move higher in the coming days. There is plenty of room in the hourly RSI and MACD to suggest movement will continue to the upside, but if UNP falls back below $42.50, I will consider my rationale invalidated and will cut the trade. 

United Technologies (UTX) is a very similar trade as it was also in a 15m squeeze, and trading near support for its recent cycle. I bought 10 $125 June 29th calls for $1.67. They are currently marked at $1.63 (unrealised return -**$110; -2.40\%)**. The stock's 15m MACD is also trading towards 0 and is just crossing over on the hourly chart. Considering the short duration of my options on UNP and UTX, I will be watching price action like a hawk tomorrow to see if it invalidates the trades. I expect I may have to hold them until Friday. 

My big loser for the day was Lowe's (LOW). The squeeze set-up on the 15m chart showed momentum to the downside, and combined with the downward trend in the hourly chart, it made me think that the movement would be to the downside. I should have seen that the stock was trading with support at its price level on the 15m chart, and that the MACD was trending upwards with the short-term line not wanting to fall beneath the longer-term line, which suggests that momentum would be to the upside. I bought 10 $100 August 17th puts for $4.40. They traded as low as $3.85 as price moved towards $99, which was my stop loss. Momentum began to slow as the stock approached the $99 level, and a spinning top was formed, followed by a small shooting star, giving me some confidence that price would turn back towards $98.50. I ended up cutting the trade when price moved back above $98.50, selling the contracts for $4.05 for a PnL of -**$350 (-8\%)**. I should have cut the trade sooner instead of letting it ride towards the stop-loss, especially since the second candle on the 15m chart after the squeeze fired obviously invalidated the trade.

In conclusion, it was a mixed day **(realized PnL -$350** (excl. WBA)**; unrealised return +$1,480)**, apart from the WBA windfall, but there was some useful lessons as well. My skillset for day trading needs work for sure. I found it more difficult to manage four active positions on a daily timeframe, compared to two or three positions I'm used to on a swing timeframe. I think I was also probably on positive tilt and too eager to put my capital work, taking too many positions, too quickly (I entered all of my positions within 20 minutes of each other). This led to misreading the indicators on LOW, and not showing the same level of selectiveness that I normally do for my swing trades. I also realise now that buying a 15m squeeze when the MACD is heading towards 0 as the run meets resistance if it isn't a clean breakout. I think we got a little too speculative today, but it was good experience. 

I like my positions in BMY and IVC, but will need to manage UTX and UNP closely tomorrow. I'll be watching XOM, JNJ, and WB for some swing squeezes. I'm still interested in shorting NFLX and buying TSLA at the right moment, the latter especially since weaker reported production numbers didn't seem to affect price. Seems like the market has priced in a very low June production number. ";244732;Market Commentary June 20th, 2018;

**Four Steps Guideline:**

1. Determine how much money you can spare for investment
2. Buy an S&amp;P 500 index (S&amp;P 500  is “the market”) (for example: SPY, VOO, IVV)
3. Hold it for many years
4. Get a good return (10&amp;#37; per year on average) after years of not touching your investment. =)

The rest of the document discuss why the four steps guideline makes you a good investor. The four steps guideline is based upon four investment principles. I personally think they are the four most important ones.

**Four Key Investment Principles:**

1. Never think you can outrun the market
2. Returns always comes with risk. The higher the return the higher the risk.
3. Diversify
4. Only do long term investment

**Some Definitions to terms I’ll be using:**

market: the US stock market. By outrunning the market people usually means to have a higher return than the US stock market as a whole.index: index is a collection of stocks, hundreds of them. Index has the natural property of being diversified because of the quantity and variety of stocks it is composed of.S&amp;P 500: S&amp;P 500 is an index composed of all the big companies in US. Apple, Amazon, Coca-cola, Wellsfargo, you name it. S&amp;P 500 is a good proxy of how the “market” perform. In other words, to buy S&amp;P 500 means you are buying the “market” and performing just as well as the market.

**#1. Never think you can outrun the market**

There are always people who are smarter than you, have more resource into studying the market and trade advantage when it comes to buying and selling real time (I’m referring to the investment banks, hedge funds and high frequency trading institutions). To think that by studying the market personally you can know more than these institutions is naive.

Think of it this way: among the retail investors who do individual stock picking and trade frequently, only 20&amp;#37; of them can actually outrun the market while 80&amp;#37; of them do worse than the market and lose out on trading fee. The chances are, you’re among the 80&amp;#37; if you’re doing stock picking.Luckily, while outperforming the market rarely happens for retail investors, matching the market performance is very easy. We do that by buying the market (S&amp;P 500)

**Implications of #1:**

* Do not do stock picking (sayings like: “I know that Uber has a new invention/technology, the stock price will surely raise so let’s buy in” or “I have paid attention to the market trend a lot, I can forsee it going up soon so let’s buy in” are nonsense)
* Buy the market (S&amp;P 500) but not individual stock.

**#2. Returns always comes with risk. The higher the return the higher the risk.**

The only riskless investment is the US treasury bond, which gives you 0.5-2&amp;#37; interest annually. But as a riskless investment, it is nonetheless better than simply leaving it in the bank (which gives you like 0.01-0.5&amp;#37; interest annually). If you are worried about inflation (1-3&amp;#37; per year), you can consider TIPS, a US government bond whose face value rise with inflation, and it gives you about 1&amp;#37; interest after adjusting for inflation.Any investment that beats the treasury bond interest rates has risk that comes with it.

The US market historically has earned 15-20&amp;#37; annually when the economy is good and **lost 25-35\% annually when the economy is bad**. The good news is that good times happened more often than bad times (historically); so if you invest for long enough, you’ll probably go through more good times than bad times and have a net gain to your investment (roughly 10&amp;#37; a year on average)

**#3. Diversify**

While risks are a necessary component when it comes to investment, not all risk are born equal. There are risk that gives you higher return and risk that don’t. We call the ‘unnecessary’ risk idiosyncratic/non-systematic risk; and you can avoid ‘unnecessary’ risk simply by buying index but not individual stocks.**Implications of #3:**

* Buy index (for example, S&amp;P 500) but not individual stock.

**#4. Do long term investment**

By long term I mean at least 2 years; preferably 5+ years; the longer the better. To do a 5 years investment on index A means to buy index A then let it sit for 5 years. Whether the price go up or down today doesn’t matter to you. You simply let it sit for 5 years. Surprisingly, that’s the best thing you can do to avoid losing money unnecessarily.There are two reasons why you only want to do long term investment. First, as a retail investor, you essentially lose a small amount of fee  (trading commission, transaction cost)  every time you trade. Even through some places offers no commission trading, you still lose in the bid ask spread and the information disadvantage.

The second reason is more subtle, which I will illustrate in the appendix section. To summarize it in a simple way, holding an investment for a long horizon diversify your risk throughout the years. The longer you hold your investment, the less likely you’ll experience an overall loss. If you held the market for a 20 years horizon you average a 10&amp;#37; gain per year, even through financial crisis.

**Implications of #4:**

* Buy index and hold it for 2 year+, the longer the better.

Again, **the Four Steps Guideline**:

1. Determine how much money you can spare for investment; they should be spare money in the sense that even if you lost your investment you can still go on normal with your life. You shouldn’t have to cut your daily spending or alter your life plan because you realize a loss in your investment (not retirement fund, not education fund, not fund for purchasing a house, not fund for raising children, etc.)
2. Buy an S&amp;P 500 index (S&amp;P 500  is “the market”) (for example: SPY, VOO, IVV)
3. Hold it for many years
4. Get a good return (10&amp;#37; per year on average) after years of not touching your investment. =)

Return and risk to the Four Steps Guideline (buying S&amp;P 500 index and hold it for a long time):

Historically, you earn 15-20&amp;#37; annually when the economy is good and **lose 25\%-35\% annually when the economy is bad**. I performed a very basic analysis in appendix A on your prospects of gain and loss with buying S&amp;P 500.

If the thought of losing 25&amp;#37; on any year is unbearable for you, instead of buying S&amp;P 500 index only you should mix it with treasury bonds under a certain ratio. **By adjusting the ratio you can in turn scale down your risk**. (which of course scale down the return at the same time.

**Commonly asked Questions and Misconceptions**

**Can I get a higher return from the stock market if I hire an investment advisor/manager?**

**No.** In general, hiring an investment manager won’t give you better return. On average, investment fund manager has perform worse than the market. I haven’t even counted the managing fees in, which could cost up to 3&amp;#37; of your investment annually. If you can follow the 4 steps above, there are really no reason to hire an investment manager, unless you have a big enough amount of investment (like 500k+) (this guide doesn’t apply to you in that case) . Even then the chances for your manager to actually be able to beat the market is low.

\*If your investment has a special purpose, like doing a retirement fund, the Four Steps Guideline is not for you. Fund managers can help you, not in picking a better stock or outperforming the market, but in tailoring the investment and risk to your personal need.

**I’m worried about buying in when the market is about to go down. How can I avoid that? (Should I buy in when the market has gone down a little bit, hoping it would bounce back?)**

Remember principle #1, never think you can outrun the market. In reality, not even the experts or professionals can predict whether the market will go up or down tomorrow. So don’t worry about guessing when the market will go up.

Now there is actually a way to reduce your chance of going all in when the market is about to drop. The technique is called *Dollar-Cost Averaging*, essentially buying equal amounts of investments at regular intervals. Look it up online if this interest you.

**I paid attention to the Wall Street Journal and Yahoo! Finance News very often. Does that help in picking a better stock or predict when the market is going up better?**

Remember principle #1, never think you can outrun the market. Reading news in WSJ or Yahoo! Finance wouldn’t help because, there are always professionals who know about those news before you (Aside from millions of readers reading it before you). If there are any profit that anyone can exploit from those news, they would certainly have exploited them before you do. So no, reading WSJ or Yahoo! Finance wouldn’t help you outrun the market.

**Appendix A: Risk and Return prospects of Four Steps Guideline Method (buying S&amp;P 500 index and hold it for a long time)**

Table A listed the 1 year, 5 year, 10 year and 20 year average return of holding S&amp;P 500 since 1990. It also listed the average return per year for each horizon.

Table A

\[see google doc link for the table: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-dbYKQ0VsX4PRQ2lt4aabLmundYKZIJ7wHKeKOlrwA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-dbYKQ0VsX4PRQ2lt4aabLmundYKZIJ7wHKeKOlrwA/edit?usp=sharing) \]

Our sample start from 1990. Let’s look at the likelihood for you to gain or loss in your investment for each horizon.

If you are doing a **1-year investment**, over the last 27 years

Prob. of above 10&amp;#37; return = P(x&gt;10&amp;#37;)= 16/27 = 59&amp;#37;

Prob. of a net positive return = P(x&gt;0&amp;#37;)= 22/27 = 81&amp;#37;

Prob. of below -10&amp;#37; return = P(x&lt;-10&amp;#37;)= 5/27=19&amp;#37;

If you are doing a **5-year investment**, over the last  27 years

Prob. of above 10&amp;#37; return per year = P(x&gt;10&amp;#37;)= 16/27 = 59&amp;#37;

Prob. of a net positive return per year= P(x&gt;0&amp;#37;)= 23/27 = 85&amp;#37;

Prob. of below -10&amp;#37; return per year = P(x&lt;-10&amp;#37;)= 4/27=15&amp;#37;

If you are doing a **20-year investment**, over the last  27 years

Prob. of above 10&amp;#37; return per year = P(x&gt;10&amp;#37;)= 19/27 = 70&amp;#37;

Prob. of a net positive return  per year= P(x&gt;0&amp;#37;)= 27/27 = 100&amp;#37;

Prob. of below -10&amp;#37; return per year = P(x&lt;-10&amp;#37;)= 0/27=0&amp;#37;

I hope that from the numbers above you see how making a **long term investment** helps you **reduce your risk** of losing money on average. If buying an index is a **diversification across different stocks** then long term investment would be a **diversification across time**.

**Appendix B: Some information to help you decide your index to treasury bond ratio.**

\*I gave exaggerated cases to illustrate the point.

**Case 1**

Risk tolerance: You have a steady job and you do not have any mortgage or loan. You now have $10000 that you don’t plan to use in the next five years. You want to put your money to investment. After evaluating your preference, you are okay with losing at most 25&amp;#37; of your investment in any year.

Action:

Put your $10000 in S&amp;P 500. Historically the most you could lose in a year can be **25-35\%** (during 2000 and 2008 crisis).  The historical average return would be roughly 10&amp;#37; per year. If you are committed to holding your investment for at least five year, you have a 85&amp;#37; change of earning a net positive return and 59&amp;#37; chance for earning over 10&amp;#37; return per year on average.

**Case 2**

Risk tolerance: you cannot bear any risk for investment; losing even 1&amp;#37; would give you a heart attack.

Action: put 100&amp;#37; of your money in US treasury bond. You’ll get 0.5-2&amp;#37; interest a year. Nonetheless better than letting the money sit in the bank.  If you are worried about inflation (1-3&amp;#37; per year), buy TIPS instead and get roughly 1&amp;#37; per year after inflation.

**Case 3**

Risk tolerance: you are a college student learning about investment the first time. You have a part time job and you do not have any mortgage or loan. You now have $10000 sitting in the bank, and you don’t need to use this $10000 in the next five years. You want to put your money to investment. After evaluating your preference, you decided you can bear at most 10&amp;#37; of loss in any year.

Action:

Target risk/ market risk= 10&amp;#37;/25&amp;#37; = 0.4

Therefore your Stock-to-Bond ratio should be 4:6.

Put $4000 of in S&amp;P 500 and the rest of $6000 in treasury bonds. The historical average return would be roughly 10&amp;#37;\*0.4+ 3&amp;#37;\*0.6=5.8&amp;#37; per year. Historically the most you could lose in a year is -35&amp;#37;\*0.4+ 3&amp;#37;\*0.6= -12&amp;#37; (during 2000 and 2008 crisis).

A careful reader at this point would ask: what if I’m okay losing more than 35&amp;#37; a year (say 50&amp;#37;), that I wanted to earn even higher return and bear more risk? I can’t put 200&amp;#37; of my money into buy S&amp;P500 can I?

The answer is, yes. That’s called leveraging your investment. That’s where derivatives and financial instruments step in. A beginner’s guide is not for these type of people. Derivatives and instruments are not for investing beginners. (and I would argue, not for most retail investors)

Sorry if this doesn't belong on this subreddit.

At my job, we get stock options every year. I don't really know a whole lot about them except I exercise them when our stock is reasonably high.

My company is being acquired by another company and it's going private.

After this announcement, the stock price jumped to higher than it's ever been, $25.80. And it's still going up.

I know nothing about stock trends or anything, so I'm not sure if I should pull the trigger on this. I'm also not sure what's going to happen with my options.

Entity17;1529725670;8t7bt0;;3;;14;"Today, i'm going to be looking at ""AIG"" which has been picked up by 6 different firms since the start of the quarter. 

http://www.dataroma.com/m/grid.php?s=q

Let's be clear, AIG's fundamentals sheet looks like something out of a ""Friday the 13th"" murder scene. 

Key Metrics:

1. P/E: 163

2. EPS Q/Q: -13.9%

3. ROE: -9.2%

**4. Debt ratio: 5.4** 

5. PEG: 4.5

AIG has been destroyed by the disaster payouts for numerous natural disasters and a debt ratio that looks insurmountable long term. Trying to understand why anyone would take the risk on this stock is unfathomable, almost comparable to a bet on GE's recovery before the next ice age. But lets take a deeper look into two key metrics: **9.7 forward P/E and an estimated EPS of 194.5% this year**. 

With the wave of natural disaster payouts, more individuals have started buying into property and casualty insurance. Although metrics aren't readily available, i'd infer this is due to the rapid climate condition changes. But this isn't the only factor as AIG has subsidiaries across the globe. Their offshoot companies have had recent successes in respective regions or new fields of insurance.

[Moody's upgrade of AIG EU Subsidiary](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/aig-subsidiaries-ratings-affirmed-by-moodys-outlook-stable-cm971559)

[Cyber Insurance](https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/ransomware-attacks-surge-cyber-insurance-claims-in-europe/) 

In light of the ever changing insurance market, there seems to be a large room for long term growth moving forward. Some of these hedge fund firms believe now is the time. It's important to remember that 10 years ago, this company was a key player in the 2008 recession. It has been left for dead and yet was revived with a government bailout. 

[Article about AIG's fall](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/american-investment-group-aig-bailout.asp)

Disclosure: I do not hold any shares in AIG at the time of writing this but do plan on acquiring with the volatility of the current market. 

___________________________________________
As a bonus, you're probably wondering why i'm so curious about a tiny list from DATAROMA but you can see KMX was a significant pick up by multiple firms this past quarter. KMX as well as UNH, ADS, CHTR, and VIAB were all on my watchlist this quarter to see if this list had possible merits in mirroring. The largest pick ups on that list have been relatively successful this past quarter. Yes, you will be getting this information LATE as the reports come in nearly 1/4th of the way through the qtr and many of these firms have huge funds to back up their mistakes. I plan on taking small positions of the largest pick ups next qtr after seeing the results of this past qtr.

As you can see we closed bang on that support level with a doji (typically seen at bottoms/tops) .

I believe this week may offer a nice buy opportunity to go long. Expecting some consolidation around this level or may very well close above $20 by next Friday.

That support level is now the bulls safe haven. If we begin to drop and close 2, 3 days below that level that would be quite a bearish signal and you need to most definitely have some sort of stop loss in place have that happen.

If buying calls,  couple months out expiry and go where the open interest is.  Cut losses have this thing break below that support.

DewbyDew;1529856756;8tit8n;;6;;1;"Disclosure - I have exposure to MCD via long SCHB and XLY

I am considering long MCD but I think it’s still a little too expensive at the ~162 range but I might pull the trigger if I see it drop into the 150s again.

I like the yield and the stability of blue chips, but I think McDonalds has a compelling story for international growth that makes it more exciting than just an income asset.

Anecdotally, I live in the DC metro area and McDonalds locations have gotten so much better over the past few years with well done renovations and improved cleanliness. Definitely think their menu has improved significantly. Recent fresh beef move seems solid. Also they’re food safety processes/record seems pretty good which is so important given the Chipotle fiascos.

But I want to ask, have other people seen the same type of positive improvements in their local McDonald’s around the country? DC metro is generally affluent so are the changes I’m seeing just around those types of areas?

One thing that gives me pause is recent articles about sexual harassment accusations and lawsuits emerging from some franchise locations. So far the coverage has been low key but I wonder how much of a powder keg that could be down the road.

Let me know your thoughts, thanks!";245564;Time for long MCD?;
throwaway9732121;1529860717;8tj9x2;;11;;22;"The reasoning is:

- there is a ton of short interest in tesla
- if some really good news arises, like hitting production goals end of june, the price will rapidly appreciate
- short sellers will want to close their short positions
- in order to close their short positions they need to buy shares quickly, inflating the price even more
- the institution, which loaned them the shares in the first place turns around and sells the shares immediately

All this leads to a quick appreciation in price, followed by a quick depreciation.

The question is, is it possible to somehow use this? For example I got burned when the price hit 370 and then quickly dropped to 330. If I knew what I know now I would have waited for a better price.

There was a time when Korea and Taiwan were new to DRAM but today they're experts and with the amount of subsidies China is providing, it seems that it's only a matter of time before they catch up or just steal the tech, which they've already been [caught trying to do](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/technology/china-micron-chips-theft.html).

Then there is the patent infringement lawsuits that the same Chine company that attempted to steal tech from Micron has filed against Micron ... and this case is being heard by the same provincial government that is a financial backer of that company - Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit.

Finally China's antitrust regulators are investigating Micron for price fixing. Both the IP lawsuit and antitrust investigation might be a way for China to exert pressure on Micron to ""share"" its IP, which admittedly is speculation on my part.

To recap

* China's gov't provides billions in subsidies to build DRAM industry
* Chinese company tried to steal Micron's tech
* Same company filed patent infringement lawsuits against Micron demanding it halt all sales in China and the case is heard by the gov't that is providing subsidies to said companies

Domo: Once valued at $2 billion privately, business analytics platform is targeting $188 million at a $546 million market value. The company grew revenue 32% in the 1Q18, with a -115% adjusted EBITDA margin. While recent high-growth SaaS IPOs have been well received, Domo has had relatively weak retention and only modest growth despite its massive spending on sales and marketing. The founder will also retain voting control (86%).
Uxin, a leading internet marketplace for used cars in China, is targeting $437 million at a $3.7 billion market value. The company grew revenue 93% to $100 million in the 1Q18 and operates in China's rapidly expanding used car market, expected to grow at a CAGR of 19% through 2022. While Uxin is a top player in this large market the area remains highly competitive and losses have been steep.

I'm new to investing and I need to understand something that happened in my portfolio. In February I bought 613 shares of a Company's shares for 0,065 $ per share for a total of 39,85$  I kind of forgot about it because I'm investing with the mindset of selling in a few years. But last week, I connected on my account to see that the share was now valued at 1,22 $ for a total value of 747.86 $. On June 22, the share symbol changed and an automatic exchange was made in my account. My 613 shares became roughly 33 shares at 1,22 $, so I'm back at my acquisition value. Why is that? Why wasn't it exchanged at market value ? Thank you :) ";245722;Shares changed symbol and lost of value, please explain;

Just-Touch-It;1529974614;8tvsl7;;55;;43;"Hello everyone,

Those of you who have followed some of my previous posts and comments around here and the other investing forums/subreddits know that I’m pretty bullish on the company Iqiyi (IQ) and China in general. I like to think that I’m a pretty reasonable investor and person so I’d figured I’d share my thoughts and two cents on the recent drop this company has experienced over the past week or so. Right off the bat, I’ll state that I’m holding this company for the long term and remain both confident and faithful in its future success. While it’s far from a majority of my portfolio, it does make up a decent percent of it (about 4-6%). I’d also like to apologize for novel I’m about to write but hopefully some of you will enjoy and appreciate it. Here we go...

So, why not panic after these pretty crazy IQ drops? Let’s look at the history of IQ over the past few months or so. The company IPO’d back at the end of March of this year. That means it has been on exchanges for just over three months! Go back and look at the histories of most companies during their infancy and early stages of being publicly traded. It’s pretty wild and not uncommon for companies to experience some sufficient volatility early on and perhaps even more so with a foreign tech stock which brings me to my next point. IQ was certainly an extreme case of this but it also isn’t the first time we’ve seen a new company shoot up then suddenly fall.

IQ is a Chinese company involved in the tech sector, a sector known for both its fast, incredible gains that often come with considerable risk and volatility. To make things more hectic, it’s a Chinese company that went public during a period of some wild times in our White House. We’ve seen before just how much of an impact a speech, tweet, or incident by President Trump can have on a company or sector and the last few weeks have certainly demonstrated this. This week, the Chinese were one of the big topics of discussion. Most of this focused on the debate over the tariffs and potential trade war with China as tensions have rose between both countries with threats being tossed back and forth, which again brings me to another point.

Trade wars typically aren’t optimal in most circumstances for anyone involved. I don’t want to argue or debate the merits of them but instead would rather focus on just how they could potentially impact a company IQ. If you have ever heard of IQ, you’ve probably heard or seen the comparison of it to Netflix. The company operates somewhat similar to Netflix in that it is a video streaming platform for movies and tv shows in China. They make their money off of primary two ways: advertising and premium memberships. For regular membership, IQ customers get access to the platform for free but are stuck with ads. Premium access reduces/eliminates advertisements but comes at a cost. So where exactly are things like tariffs going to hurt a company like IQ? 

While there is probably little debate that a trade war could negatively impact the average Chinese consumer, it’s unlikely to significantly impact a company like IQ whose product is service based rather than actual physical goods that need to be held in front of you, produced from raw materials in other countries, be transported and imported from around the world, etc. To me, a trade war and/or additional tariffs would appear to have little impact on the company once most of dust settles. I think what we are seeing now is the market once again being sensitive and overreacting to the news and threats without actually taking into consideration just what companies and how they will be affected by things like tariffs and a trade war.

Let’s look at price now. IQ experienced an unbelievable run over the past few weeks. Too good of a run if you ask me and it was unrealistic to think it would continue or maintain itself. It was at about $18 a share at the end of April, rose about 38% in month to about $25 a share at the end of May, and then jumped to $43 in June 18! The company had more than doubled itself in less than two months for crying out loud. Of course it wasn’t going to continue or maintain its trend. It simply became too popular too fast as we saw with dozens of posts and comments on here along with news articles and tv reports. It was the hot stock of the week and it sadly wasn’t going to last or continue.

I like IQ for a variety of reasons and get upset when I see people call it a meme stock around here and other forums. China’s middle class is growing rapidly and they have several tv shows with viewership numbers who tune in during a normal, boring Tuesday night that rival the amount of viewers the super bowl gets in the US. Their population is ridiculously huge and with an improving economy and growing middle class, I think China has potential to be the Wild West of the investing world over the course of the next decade. They have the backing of one of China’s most powerful companies in Baidu and have agreements/partnerships with US companies Netflix and Google. They own and/or televise a handful of China’s top ten biggest and most popular tv shows and their user base has continued to grow rapidly year after year.

Now let’s talk about growth and potential. China’s population is estimated to be at over 1.3 billion people. The entire population of the United States is currently believed to be about 325 million. That’s a huge difference and speaks major volume to just how big China and its population truly is. Even more incredible is that over 1/3 of Chinese citizens have extremely limited or entirely no access to internet. The cherry on top is that there middle class is growing and growing fast. According to 2016 B.I. article, the middle class made up roughly 4% of China’s urban population in 2000. By 2022, estimates have this number moving to about 76% of the urban population. GDP and consumer consumption rates are expected to grow in solid rates as well. This leaves a lot of potential for the taking if things continue.

IQ has yet to make a profit but it’s so early on for this company that it’s tough to fault it, at least this soon. Netflix didn’t immediately turn a profit and instead focused on growth and expansion which is what IQ appears to be focusing on now. It worked great for Netflix so hopefully IQ can share some of that success. So far, it’s worked as membership has grown dramatically each year and the amount of for pay premium subscriptions has more than doubled since early 2017. They currently have a little over 60 million subscribed users (Netflix has about 125 million) so there is still a lot of room left for this one, especially in a country so much larger than the US. They have also made a few acquisitions in hopes of expanding their viewer base and offering a better platform for its users. Growth and expansion is the current mindset, profits will (hopefully!) come later.

Now it wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t share my concerns with IQ. The first and likely biggest concern with them is competition. The field of entertainment and video streaming is very competitive in China and one of IQ’s biggest competitors has the backing of the giant company Tencent. Thankfully, US companies like Netflix appear to wish to work with IQ rather than against them which should ease the burden a bit but domestic competition is still a serious threat. 

Another threat, like with most Chinese companies, is the government. China’s government yields massive power and influence so it’s important the company knows it limits and remains on good footing with the government. We’ve seen in the past just how fast the Chinese government can step in and take control or exert its power on companies that it doesn’t view in a positive light. Hopefully both parties can get along and mesh well. China as a country also has a bit of a rocky history and past as well, and it wouldn’t be the first time we think they’re finally making the big leap (no pun intended) only to fall flat. Will this time be any different or will old habits prove difficult to break?

The final concern is their book keeping. Again, like many publicly traded Chinese companies there is always concern over just how truthful and legitimate their financial records and releases are. Thankfully IQ is under a lot of eyes right now and things have improved a lot over the past decade or so in China so hopefully this isn’t a problem but is never a bad idea to be skeptical and alert.

So what do I recommend? If you’re an IQ holder, have done your own research, and truly believe in the company then I’d say sit tight and stomach the rough seas. The worst may not be over but I do have confidence in the company for the long term. If you’re not invested in the company but are thinking about getting in during this dip, I’d only recommend doing so if you’re willing to hold long and stick through all the ups and downs. I’d suggest waiting until mid to late July to see how things play out with some of the tariffs becoming implemented and see where the concerns with a trade war lay. If you’re not invested and don’t my want to touch this one with a ten foot pole, I can’t blame you so just sit back and relax. I’ll either look like the second coming of Buffett or an absolute fool.";245866;IQ holders, relax!!;

* President Trump's clout within the GOP is on the line in today's elections. Voters will weigh in on candidates in seven states, but the contest that matters most to Trump is South Carolina, where he appeared at a rally to help Gov. Henry McMaster before polls opened. (AP)
* Top tech companies, including Amazon and Apple, met with U.S. intelligence officials last month to discuss preparations for the midterm elections, The New York Times reported. It came in anticipation of a repeat of the Russian meddling that occurred during the 2016 election.
* Peter Navarro, one of Trump's top trade advisors, said the market was overreacting Monday to fears the administration would restrict foreign investment as part of its trade actions. He said investors should focus on the White House's efforts to protect American exports.
* Border officials have suspended handing over migrant families to prosecutors, effectively reviving the Obama administration’s “catch and release” policy that has angered Trump. Prosecutions of adults crossing the border without children continued. (NY Times)
* Despite public outrage over Trump's immigration policy of separating children from their parents who crossed into the U.S. unauthorized, the president's approval rating has not deviated from its recent upward trend, according to recently released surveys. (CNBC)
* Conservative Rep. Steve King tweeted the U.S. is heading toward another civil war. The tweet came with a link to an article about a group of protesters who were staging an ""occupy""-style campout in front an Immigration and Customs Enforcement holding facility. (USA Today)
* Jerry Storch, a former CEO of bankrupt Toys R Us, is considering reviving the toy retailer, according to Bloomberg. He has been working with Credit Suisse Group and Fairfax Financial Holdings to stitch his plan together. Toys R Us finishes shuttering its locations this week.
* A new survey finds it's still tough to be a woman on Wall Street and men don't always notice. A Catalyst study reports that fewer than 17 percent of senior leaders in investment banking are women. All the top banks are run by men.
* Elon Musk has been running a secretive, highly selective private schoolout of SpaceX’s headquarters in California, according to a report. There is heavy emphasis on math, science, engineering and ethics — at the expense of instruction in languages, music and sports.

Would be my first time buying call options and I was wondering for example $SQ, at a $62.50 call at a premium of $1.13 and break even at $63.63, if I hit $65.00, would it be MOST PROFITABLE to exercise that option and purchase all 100 shares (let’s assume it’s about to expire and at its peak) then immediate sell for a profit? Or would selling your call option at some point also be as profitable as buying and selling the shares? Or you could buy 50/100 of the shares if you think the next day has over a 50% of going up but still want to secure profits?

jevt1987;1530050243;8u43w1;;0;;1;"Hello!

I am new to investing in the market, but last year I got advice from a coworker to put some money into Enphase when it was low, and the stock soared, fueling my interest in how it all works.

Currently, I've been keeping a close eye on enphase, and feel confident that the company will likely continue a good course for 5 years, conservatively speaking, and my investment is well under my risk tolerance, so if things flop, it would be okay.

Recently I started learning about options trading, and it's been a bit difficult to fully understand the concepts, but after some effort, I grasped the concept of buying puts, which leads to my current situation.

I trade through robinhood as it was an enticing way to dip my toes into the market.  They are now giving me an offer of $3000 margin (I can cover this amount if things go bad), at a rate of $15 a month.

Through robinhood, the lowest put is at $2.5 a share and I get $60 for taking 12 contracts, which drains the margin to zero.

Considering the changes having taken place with Enphase, and the direction of the company, I am very confident that I will not have to pay out on the put before the expiration date, and if someone does exercise the option, it would get me 1200 shares at a significant discount.

So my question is... Am I missing something here?  Is this technically free money as long as the stock continues to perform?  Like I said, I'm new at this, and my only safeguard is that I'm betting well below my risk tolerance.

The way I see it is that my costs are covered by buying the put, grossing $45 at the end of the month, with a pretty sizable upside if someone were to call on the contracts.  It's not much money, but it beats a savings account.

Is there a better or different way to do this? Am I neglecting something somewhere?  I guess I'm just in a bit of shock that this is a thing.";246077;Taking advantage of buying lowball puts;

jevt1987;1530052759;8u4eyi;;7;;1;"Hello!

I am new to investing in the market, but last year I got advice from a coworker to put some money into Enphase when it was low, and the stock soared, fueling my interest in how it all works.

Currently, I've been keeping a close eye on enphase, and feel confident that the company will likely continue a good course for 5 years, conservatively speaking, and my investment is well under my risk tolerance, so if things flop, it would be okay.

Recently I started learning about options trading, and it's been a bit difficult to fully understand the concepts, but after some effort, I grasped the concept of selling puts, which leads to my current situation.

I trade through rbnhd as it was an enticing way to dip my toes into the market. They are now giving me an offer of $3000 margin (I can cover this amount if things go bad), at a rate of $15 a month.

Through rbnhd, the lowest put is at $2.5 a share and I get $60 for taking 12 contracts, which drains the margin to zero.

Considering the changes having taken place with Enphase, and the direction of the company, I am very confident that I will not have to pay out on the put before the expiration date, and if someone does exercise the option, it would get me 1200 shares at a significant discount.

So my question is... Am I missing something here? Is this technically free money as long as the stock continues to perform? Like I said, I'm new at this, and my only safeguard is that I'm betting well below my risk tolerance.

The way I see it is that my costs are covered by selling the put, grossing $45 at the end of the month, with a pretty sizable upside if someone were to call on the contracts. It's not much money, but it beats a savings account.

Is there a better or different way to do this? Am I neglecting something somewhere? I guess I'm just in a bit of shock that this is a thing.";246079;Am I doing this right? (Selling puts);

____DEADPOOL_______;1530068616;8u65nl;;31;;0;"**About me:**

- I'm 40
- Predicted the 2008 meltdown but didn't act on it
- Feel confident I will always have a stream of work due to connections and my type of career even during a financial crisis
- Have about $100k saved sitting in the bank
- Own home and new'ish cars outright, no mortgage or car payments

**My plan:**

- Put $50,000 to $75,000 into mining stocks such as $ABX or $GPL as I believe they're very low priced now
- Wait until the next financial crisis
- Profit

I live overseas so keeping an eye on stocks during trading times is very difficult for me. I have played around buying and selling with the above two stocks and have gone up 30% in the last year but I'm getting tired of doing it and I feel they have bottomed out right now and that I should stop risking things.

I've also been using the think or swim platform for charts and quotes and I've become very comfortable with the layout and actually really like it. However my main concern with them is that I witnessed a whole system freeze for a good hour around 10:00AM towards beginning of june. I was in an overnight play that gapped up 60% and was relying on think or swim for technical analysis. However TD ameritrade froze for a whole hour and had half the chat room I was monitoring completely fcked, unable to sell. when system started working again the stock was trading red. I googled more about it and apparently td ameritrade had an incident like this happen 3+ times already this year.... That's a serious disaster im not willing to invite. 


I am looking for a broker I can stick with for a long period of time, with fast executions, small commission fees, and most importantly looking for one that is good at finding shares to short.

sageredwood;1530130647;8ucz3v;Advice Request;0;;1;"So I purchased Nintendo stock before E3, I have managed to do this for the last 2 years and I made a decent profit each time. 

However the stock value as dropped from $52 when i purchased it to now sub $40.

So here is where I am, I have lost some value; however, I don't see a good reason for Nintendo to be dropping so fast. The numbers still look good. Switch sales are still good, software sales still look good, 3ds is curving off somewhat but so far it is still making money, attach rate is good, DLC purchase is still good. Not to mention the Switch did so damn well Nvidia is accounting a huge boost in revenue because of the handheld. 

I also don't see any signs of a software shortage coming on the console. I understand many people found E3 Underwhelming, but I just didn't. I saw a steady line up of in demand games coming to the console to support the player base Nintendo already has. Granted nothing other than Smash seemed to be a system seller *(I'm discounting Dragon Ball Fighterz here, because I'm a bit of an odd ball gamer myself)* So I can understand that critique. 

So to recap, I think Nintendo looks very strong over the next 2 to 5 years, so why is everyone dumping this stock now? should I buy while it's cheap or chuck my losses and go home?

But I run into question where I cannot distinguish if the upper shadow is slightly longer than the lower or the lower shadow being slightly longer than the upper one. I’ll illustrate.

Pi-R-Squared;1530210778;8um57h;;13;;5;"I understand for UPS that losing AMZN as a customer stinks. But they make ~$68Billion in profits, and the AMZN Shipments make up only about $1.5B of their profits. I know $1.5B is a lot of money to lose, but it only makes up 1.5% of UPS profits. 


The next point is that AMZN will only be handling their own shipments... so these claims that ""AMZN is going after UPS, FDX, Etc."" are off base. There is a lot of panic selling going on right now. and this is actually good for potential investors in my opinion which is going to lead into my next point....


Not to be corny but ""Winter is coming"". Ok yes that was corny, but the point is still valid. What do we all know about delivery companies? Their best quarter is the 4th quarter of every year. Christmas...Black Friday immediately come to mind. These companies always have strong revenues at the end of the year....and with a lot of panic selling going on right now there is definitely a good chance to get in early when people start to realize that AMZN doesn't make up a large portion of UPS profits. 

How far will they fall? This I cannot answer for you. My best advice here is to wait for resistances and right now there are none at the moment.  

What if you don't like UPS? FDX is also down significantly. They are also looking attractive right now with these threats of AMZN dominating the delivery market.


I don't usually do posts like this, a friend of mine asked me for me insight on to when I pull the trigger on investments and then said I should share with others too... so here's me sharing!

So currently, Walmart has significantly more revenue than Amazon, but much less market capitalization because of Amazon’s greater growth potential. Walmart is clearly concerned about the threat Amazon poses, hence why they bought Flipcart, Amazon’s rival in India. 

Considering the difference in cash flows between these two companies, and Walmart’s concerns about Amazon overtaking it, why don’t they just use their cash they have to buy some of Amazon now? Even though their market cap is huge, Walmart has the money to buy a stake of them just through the free market if they so desired.

It’s been another rough quarter for the rollout of [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)’s Model 3. The factory was shut down at least twice for [extensive upgrades](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-06-08/tesla-model-3-photos-of-elon-musk-s-factory-in-fremont), a new production line was hastily erected in a [tent in the parking lot](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/the-future-of-tesla-hinges-on-this-gigantic-tent), and Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk moved from sleeping on the couch to [sleeping under the desk](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-races-to-exit-teslas-production-hell-1530149814). He was [even seen personally torquing bolts](https://twitter.com/S_Padival/status/1009956753272782848) on an assembly line, alongside a summer intern. 

Now the mad scramble to meet a self-imposed production deadline—a rate of 5,000 cars per week by the end of June—is coming to an end. The quarter concludes Saturday, and Tesla is expected to report its production figures for the last three months before the July 4 holiday. Tesla has repeatedly fallen short of its own manufacturing targets. Now investors will find out exactly how many cars Tesla made, sold, and stockpiled and what sort of weekly rate they were finally able to achieve.

Here’s our rundown of what to expect. 

## Seeing a Shortfall: Bloomberg’s Model 3 Tracker

Back in February, Bloomberg introduced an experimental tool to [track the Model 3 rollout](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/). The tracker uses vehicle identification numbers (VINs) to estimate production in real time. The model projects that Tesla finished the quarter making 27,957 Model 3s—or 4,533 per a week, shy of Musk’s goal. Since production of the Model 3 began in July 2017, the Bloomberg tracker estimates that 40,409 of the sedans have been made.   


Musk himself has suggested that this estimate is too low. An analyst report by Goldman Sachs, which projected quarterly production that’s just 43 cars more than the Bloomberg estimate, prompted the CEO to send an email to his employees. “They are [in for a rude awakening](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/musk-says-rude-awakening-awaits-bearish-goldman-sachs-analyst),” Musk wrote. 

The Bloomberg model is, by design, slow to reflect sudden shifts in production and could underestimate Tesla’s last-minute manufacturing push that spilled into a gigantic tent outside the factory in Fremont, California. Back in the first quarter, the Bloomberg Model 3 Tracker underestimated the actual production total by less than 5 percent—coming closer than the Wall Street consensus. The tool doesn’t estimate total deliveries, which can vary based on the number of cars in transit at the end of the quarter.  

## Wall Street Doesn’t Think Tesla Made It

Wall Street has also been placing their bets on Tesla’s quarterly figures. The average of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projects second-quarter Model 3 deliveries of 26,121 cars. Three analysts also gave estimates for production, which averaged 30,167.

The number most people are watching is Tesla’s weekly production rate, a squishy figure that Musk has set up as his quarterly benchmark. Tesla initially targeted a rate of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017, but the company has since moved that target back twice. Only one firm stuck their neck out with an estimate of weekly production: Evercore ISI predicts that Tesla will hit 4,600 during the final week.  

Total shipments for Models S and X are expected to be around 22,622 units, according to an average of six estimates. 

One thing that makes this quarter particularly hard to assess is the approaching expiration of the U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles. [Tesla may be suppressing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2018-03-12/insights-on-telsa-model-3-bloomberg-tracker#5B2D2D9D68C80000) U.S. sales as the quarter ends as way to extend its federal electric-vehicle tax credit of $7,500 per car. The subsidy begins to phase out one full quarter after the quarter in which Tesla sells its 200,000th electric car in the U.S. By hitting that milestone after July 1, rather than a day earlier, Tesla would gain an additional three months of tax credits that could be worth [more than $400 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2018-03-12/insights-on-telsa-model-3-bloomberg-tracker#5B2D66D868BC0000) to Tesla customers, according to Bloomberg estimates. 

In June, Tesla filled Model 3 orders to reservation holders in Canada ahead of deliveries to some U.S. customers. There are other actions Tesla may be taking, including accelerating its overseas deliveries for the Model S and Model X and stockpiling cars at holding facilities, all of which could push quarterly revenue into the third quarter, which is when Musk vows that Tesla will finally become profitable. 

Tesla’s stock has been on a tear in the second quarter, boosted by apparent progress on Model 3 production. The stock has climbed 31 percent to close at $349.93 on Thursday. Tesla’s market value reached $59.4 billion—more than long-established rivals General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co.

Here’s a roundup of what analysts’ are saying ahead of the key delivery figures: 

**Goldman Sachs, David Tamberrino:**   
**(**Sell, price target $195)

* “We believe that Model 3 deliveries are tracking below consensus.”
* “Investor conversations on the stock have moved past the 5,000/week run-rate production target (as we believe most investors are giving the company credit for achieving this level entering third quarter) toward vehicle profit margins and conversion of Model 3 reservations to higher priced vehicles.”
* Forecasts Tesla achieving about 22,000 Model 3 deliveries to customers in the quarter, up from Goldman’s previous 19,000 estimate, but well below consensus. His forecast for production is 28,000, in line with the [Bloomberg Tracker](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/). 
* Believes Tesla is tracking below its 2018 Model S/X guidance of about 100,000 units, based on the quarter-to-date May cadence.

**Barclays, Brian Johnson**  
(Underweight, price target $210)

* “While we appreciate the steps taken to raise capacity, we believe the admission that it needed a second general assembly line to reach 5,000/week is another indicator of the challenges in ramping production.”
* “On the path to reaching 10,000 model 3/week, one key item to be addressed is paint shop capacity. The paint shop will need to have capacity added to handle 10,000 Model 3/week in addition to 2,000 S/X per week.”

**Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi**  
(Market-perform, price target $265)

* Says Tesla’s Automotive segment’s gross margins may be overstated, noting a steep plunge in the gross margins of the Services and Other segment.
* Expects second-quarter Model 3 deliveries of 26,000.

**Evercore ISI, Arndt Ellinghorst &amp; George Galliers**  
(In-line, price target )

* Expects Tesla to deliver “21,800 Model S/X during the quarter and 30,700 Model 3, with Model 3 production at a run-rate of 4,600 during the final week versus guidance of 5,000.'”
* Notes comments by Panasonic executive that a pick-up in Model 3 production has resulted in occasional battery shortages.

**Guggenheim, Robert Cihra**  
(Buy, price target $430)

* Still sees Tesla flipping from “losses to profits in second half of 2018” and the prospect of a profitable Tesla setting up a “meaningfully more positive stock narrative.”
* “Tesla producing as many as 35,000 Model 3s and shipping 29,000, up from just over 8,000 in the first quarter and 2,000 in the fourth quarter.”
* “While 6 months later than projected, we continue to estimate that 5,000/week bogey then setting up Tesla’s overall model to flip from sizable cash burn in first half of 2018 to profitability in second half, as Model 3 volumes drive big revenue, margin and free cash flow leverage off the big fixed-cost structure Tesla has been building.”

**Consumer Edge, James Albertine**  
(Overweight, price target $385)

* “Production of the Model 3 is still the primary driver of upside to expectations and shares in 2018.”
* “We visited the Gigafactory in May, which is when we learned about Tesla’s push to 5,000 units per week of Model 3 production by second quarter-end, a goal we believe many investors did not believe management could achieve prior to our visit.”
* Estimates second-quarter Model 3 deliveries to stand at 25,000 units.

**Baird, Ben Kallo**  
(Outperform, price target $411)

* “We expect the focus will be on exit rate Model 3 production and total Model 3 production in June, in that order, and believe the stock could trade up if Tesla approaches its 5,000/week production target.”
* “We think TSLA may deliver about 25,000 vehicles.”
* “Consensus estimates for second-quarter deliveries may be too high, particularly given our belief there could be a larger-than-normal delta between production and deliveries due to the ramp during the quarter.”";246623;Tesla Reaches Moment of Truth in Mad Dash to Make 5,000 Cars Per Week;

Here is my concern.

digitalradiohead;1530365897;8v1wag;;56;;65;So can anyone give me the bear case for this stock assuming it goes along with the acquisition of fox? Basically the deal will enable Disney to provide a direct to consumer service with a disgusting amount of exclusive content that they know how to monetize in ways that only Disney can. They can now offer new blockbuster movies exclusively through their service and I'm wondering if even movie theaters will have to subscribe if they want to put it on their big screens. That means that Disney can now use their best assets(movies that attract audiences of all ages and backgrounds) to increase subscriber growth and it also puts them in complete control of digital advertising(basically FANG's bread and butter) on their platform which i'm sure will be in very high demand from companies with a lot of money to spend. When you add all of that up with an already successful parks and resorts business, I just don't see how they can screw this up. There is nothing really stopping them from carving out a center in the digital space and perhaps joining FANG in those high price valuations. what am i missing here? I know that they are traditionally not a tech stock and that could be a challenge for them as they enter the space, but if they acquire fox, hulu will fall into their lap, and that is not a bad start.

TRPalconFunch;1530475145;8vclpg;;15;;0;"If you'd like context as to why I'm looking into trading as opposed to getting another job, read this next paragraph. If not and you're just looking for my question, skip to the bold text.

I was recently accepted into a private university in Japan, which is great because I've always wanted to study abroad and Japan's society is something that I vibe really well with. One of the benefits of studying abroad is the lower tuition costs, which is absolutely terrific. In total, the cost of my tuition for a year came down to $8,000 after I earned a 25% tuition reduction scholarship. My parents had been saving money for my college for years in advance so they are generously covering tuition while leaving the living costs to me. I picked a pretty small apartment (even for Kyoto standards) and have estimated a budget of around $6,500 to $7,000 for my first semester. When I started I had about $300 in a savings account and after doing some commission work on my blog for half a month I've gotten that up to around $1,000. I also have plans to start doing streams to boost the rate of donations and/or commissions but even with that I'm still worried about whether or not I'll be able to make the $7,000 deadline. I currently work full time on my father's farm to pay reparations for a roof over my head and food when I need it. Unfortunately, the nearest town is *just* far enough away for it to be a hassle to drive into, which makes getting a second job out of the question, not to mention the fact that I'm leaving in early September so I'd only be at that job for a hot minute. I'm worried sick that I won't be able to make this happen for myself. My parents have reassured me that if I'm short they're not just going to abandon me in Japan and that they'll support me, but at 19 years old, 20 by the time I leave, I find that continuing to rely on my parents is kind of embarrassing, and I don't want to be a burden forever. I'm looking into stocks because it's something that wouldn't require physical investment that I could be spending doing extra farmwork or doing commissions.

**In short,** I need to make about $100 to $150 dollars a day. I wouldn't rely on stocks for that entirely, since I imagine starting out in the stock market doesn't have you making hundreds of dollars on day one, but I want to look into investing a bit over the summer to supplement what else I have coming in. Is this feasible? Am I looking at this unrealistically? I'm not trying to ""get rich quick"" or whatever, I just want to make enough money to pay my bills while in school. I'd just look this up but my situation, I feel, is so specific that I wouldn't be able to get an entirely accurate answer from any preexisting guide.

anxietrees;1530638988;8vu3el;Discussion;27;;2;Their products are generally considered to be user-friendly, fashionable, and reliable.  That public perception is really important when it comes to the actual stock price, in addition to the success of the company.  The other thing is that they really aren't in danger of anti-trust lawsuits because they just focus on selling their products which are the type of products that will always have competition due to the large amount of people who feel they can get more bang for their buck elsewhere.  I don't think that will change with them any time soon, either.  They're not trying to be too big to fail which also helps public perception.  This is where I worry about Amazon.  They are acquiring a lot of different companies in a lot of different areas.  While they do have competition in the individual areas they are involved in, they will pretty soon be in a class of their own as a whole company if they continue growing at this rate.  What will the next liberal president do about that?  Also, Apple doesn't seem to have the privacy concerns that Facebook has.

paper_warrior;1530725645;8w3fyx;;17;;17;"First time ever writing one of these, so hopefully this doesn’t suck content/formatting-wise.        

***Disclosure: I own/am long $SAM.***


**tl;dr:** The Boston Beer Company is a great buy at its current price and I believe that it will continue to prosper under the guidance of new leadership and its product offerings.    

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Quick facts:**    
- Dave Burwick (former CEO of Peet's coffee) has joined $SAM at the helm as the new CEO of the company.
- Product shipment volume has increased since last Q1 reports by 15% on the year.
- Q1 EPS was reported as 0.78, ~42% growth over the same period last year (Q1 reports are always their weakest, but that’s fairly typical for this industry in general)
- Depletions (this tracks how much product is moved from warehouse to stores) grew by 8%.
- Non “Sam Adams Beer” products owned by $SAM (Truly Hard Seltzer, Angry Orchard, and others) appear to be doing significantly well in their respective markets, offsetting a decrease in performance by its standard beer products.

**Analysis/Opinions:**

**CEO:**    
One of the most promising indicators of future growth for the company - to me - is bringing on Dave Burwick as CEO to replace Martin Roper. Burwick is familiar with the company itself operationally and has been on the board for ~13 years.

Burwick previously served as the CEO of Peet’s Coffee, which while being privately owned, still held a fair amount of market space overall in the coffee market itself.

One of the most promising factors of Burwick being at the helm, outside of his experience at running a company in *somewhat* of the same industry as $SAM, is the strategy that seemed to produce great results at Peet’s. Much of $SAM’s recent success has come from their “non-beer” products, such as Angry Orchard and Truly Hard Seltzer. I very much believe that Burwick will not only capitalize on the existing markets for their currently owned products such as these with additional marketing + brand enhancement, but that he will additionally look into buying smaller third-party companies in order to expand the $SAM product line up even further. When at Peet’s, [he did so quite aggressively](http://fortune.com/2015/10/30/peets-coffee-stake-intelligentsia/) .

**Truly Hard Seltzer:**    
As funny as it sounds, I’m extremely bullish on the Hard Seltzer market in and of itself and believe that $SAM will continue to see revenue gains in this area.

[Interest in Hard Seltzer has exploded over the last two years as a seasonal summer product](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Hard%20Seltzer). It seems like all of the major players have joined the game in this market and additionally I’ve even seen brands like Trader Joe’s come out with their own product this year. The product itself I believe will continue to gather popularity, especially in crowds who are focused on low-calorie/low-carb alcohol options.

While I’m not sure on the exact margin per product, the main ingredients themselves - and volume of product to price of product - lead me to believe that they make a fair amount on each pack sold. That said, this is an extremely seasonal (summer) product, so I’m curious on how they handle the huge reduction in production on off-seasons.    

**Conclusion:**    
In the goal of trying to keep this from becoming a novel, while I could definitely dive into the financial side of things with this company, but I’d recommend checking them out yourself as overall they look to be fairly promising. While the craft beer market as a whole is an extremely competitive and saturated space in the US, I expect $SAM to continue growing overall and adapting to the market by increasing sales and market recognition for its non-beer products, as well as by increasing efficiency and ease of access to their products overall.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

With all of the above said, please make sure to do your own research before hopping in. This recommendation/opinion is only my own and stocks are always a risky venture, so buy at your own risk. :)

Some say it is temporary. How do we know that it is temporary? If so, for how long? Even if it its for a few months, that may imply a significant portion of their revenue this fiscal year. 

Is there any quantifiable metric that sheds light on how high the global demand is in compared to global supply? Say China decides to buy from Hynix/Samsung.

motterpaul;1530829254;8wepoy;;7;;1;"I am looking to people who focus more on bonds than stocks to answer this question. 

I am a regular stock trader/investor. in 2016 I had some money in the JNK (Junk-bond or corporate bond) ETF. It gives a regular monthly dividend at about 5.5% yield which is a handy way to get a small but regular monthly income from assets. In 2016 I not only got the dividends, but my principle investment also went up, so I got a ""double.""

But now bond values are currently going down because interest rates are going up (meaning existing bonds that were issued at lower rates are now less valuable). As that happens the trading price of JNK goes down, so while you make the dividend money, you lose on the principle amount.

Any ideas on when or how we will know when getting back into a corporate bond fund will be a good move again? The logical answer is ""when interest rates peak"" but is there a more concise answer or leading indicator on when getting back into these funds is the right move?

I haven’t done enough research on why a business won’t just use the online USPS postage service (Click N Ship). It seems to be STMP has better rates which outweighs the monthly subscription if you ship enough, and provides more mail classes whereas Click N Ship only provides some of the classes.

Bears have non stop calling for peak cycle since last year and micron just keeps trucking along and even has guided higher than expected yet still trades as one of the cheapest stock in the s&amp;p500 while being one of the most profitable companies out there. With tech moving in the direction it is now, memory is key. Micron has some of the best memory products on the market and is also innovating new products for future tech. They have partnered with many large companies in tech such as Nvidia to create better faster memory solutions. Now bears are using the trade war narrative against micron and micron has immediately responded by saying this hasn’t really affected their guidance. So how many more times does micron have to prove bears wrong till it trades at a normal tech p/e. Yes bears cyclical argument sees memory as a commodity that will see a surplus in supply. But demand is out pacing supply and is seen to keep growing due to the direction where tech is moving. Manufacturing memory isn’t as easy as it used to be due to cost. Companies cant just set up shop in 6 months and create more supply. Its a long process but as this process is taking place demand is increasing also as more tech needs memory. Plus micron is also a quality manufacturer of memory. They have some of the best products on market. Companies want quality products from suppliers not low quality knockoffs.  Micron is placed in a perfect tech ecosystem where memory is king. So what does micron have to do to actually trade at a reasonable p/e?

NineteenEighty9;1531151489;8xcx4r;Discussion;2;;11;"Full disclosure: I purchased 110,000 shares of GLH a couple weeks ago after months of research, average cost $0.23. I plan on holding all my shares until at least 2028 (when the NA cannabis industry is projected to mature). I own an investment business &amp; am comfortable with the speculative nature of this stock. GLH is a very speculative investment, please be aware of the risks before investing. Please don’t speculate unless you can afford to lose 100% of your investment.


Golden Leaf holdings (GLH, GLDFF)


I started studying GLH again a few months back while browsing Cannabis companies with operations in Canada and the US. Since then I’ve read every article, statement, quarterly report etc… from GLH I could find. I initially stayed away from the company when I started investing in cannabis because they had a sketchy management team who didn’t do any favours for shareholders, management has now changed. According to the new CEO William Simpson, the founder of Chalice Farms. The only thing left of the old management is the name (see interview linked below). From what I can gather when GLH bought out Chalice Farms last summer Simpson and his people lead a sort of corporate coup, booted the old management and took over. Simpson is now the CEO &amp; his Chalice farms co-founder is the COO (see investor presentation linked below for senior management bios)


This new team appears to have their heads on their shoulders. They have a great track record with Chalice Farms (an award winning dispensary chain with 7 locations in Oregon). My biggest concern with the industry is there is so much emphasis on cultivation that we could be risking an oversupply. On top of that there’s no distribution, it’s great to grow the stuff but you have to be able to deliver it to the end consumer in a profitable way. This will hurt margins at all the producers, big &amp; small. Strategically GLH is in a fantastic position to grow rapidly when US legalization occurs, they’re either licensed or acquiring licenses in most legal US states &amp; Canada. They are nearly cash flow positive and currently have over $22m USD cash on hand. Once they receive their extraction license they’ll become profitable imo. Canaccord Genuity released a report recently staying the company is undervalued.

The plan to sell Chalice farms franchises for $50k is a great way to grow distribution. The biggest value add products in the industry are oils, extracts &amp; edibles, by franchising distribution it’ll help provide some consistent cash flow as well  as a distribution channel for in-house high margin products where they’ll have a say in price, shelf-space etc.. I think Simpson’s focus on more value add products like edibles &amp; oils is brilliant because their margins won’t disappear in the event of over supply (Like in Oregon). Simpson said recently it’s cheaper for them to buy flower on the open market then to produce it due to oversupply. 

Golden Leaf itself will be able to focus on improving their premium brand selection without having to worry about distribution.  They are already in markets like California, Canada, Nevada, Oregon. Once they roll out the franchise systems and the industry matures I believe they’ll be huge.High end recognized brands with quality products are the future of the mainstream cannabis industry IMO. The US cannabis boom will be 10x the size of Canada’s. They have the potential to be the Starbucks of cannabis imo.

Always do your own research before listening to a stranger online lol. I’ve linked everything I’ve read backing up my opinion. I’d love some feedback from more seasoned investors.

Pure_Tendies;1531223740;8xocj3;;4;;3;"Hey, so Ive been doing some research into some stocks id like to invest in. I noticed that the Diluted EPS is around 2, while the standard eps is .5.

 Ive looked around online and cant find anything that explains why Diluted was greater than normal eps.

In my understanding; diluted eps only ads to the denominator (the bottom half of the fraction?) so why would diluted ever be higher?

ConsiderTheBulldog;1531234588;8xpwes;;26;;21;"Hey guys, I have a question regarding investing discipline and your own personal practices.  I have two stocks that I'm very bullish on, yet I was unable to get a full position in either of them before they ran up a good bit.  I love the long term prospects for both, but I'm wondering whether I should wait for yet another pullback before trying to get some more money in and risk missing even more of a move.  

For context:

\-I  bought about a half position in Coupa Software (COUP) in early May and almost immediately it started moving.  It's currently up a little over 26&amp;#37; since.   I keep expecting it to take a breather, but it keeps inching up.  

\-I grabbed  a half position in The Trade Desk (TTD) a couple of weeks back when it had an inexplicable 6&amp;#37; or so drop on a tariff-related down day.  It's currently up about 7&amp;#37; since and I'm not sure that I can bank on getting another big dip like that to bite off some more.

How would some of you approach these situations?  If you're a long-term believer in a stock, do you just take the risk or do you wait for any sort of dip and potentially miss another big move?  I'd love any and all perspectives.  Thanks!";248846;When to chase a stock?;

DutchinPoland;1531379281;8y7ja4;Discussion;8;;0;Since the NATO members have committed to spending more of their GDP on defence so they will reach the threshold of 2% and Trump is pushing them to do so, I assume the Aerospace and Defence sector is probably a good sector to invest in.

Encouragedissent;1531454141;8ygpni;;2;;2;"I just started reinvesting after dumping all of my holdings to buy a house. I didnt want a mortgage, and feel the market is nearing the top. So the safety next and free cashflow from not having a mortgage was a safer, and more appealing approach than paying 4.5%(or more, my credit is meh).

So as ive slowly started to re-enter buying stocks, ive been looking for opportunities in sectors that are not overbought, and also have potential for growth. So far the most appealing is foreign companies, and id like to broaden my portfolio there. My US stocks so far ive started accumulating are only in financials and defense. I think China's bear market and looking trade war presents great long term opportunity. I can weather averaging down, I just need good companies. So far Ive only bought BABA, with each time its dipped below 190 in the past 2 weeks ive bought a few shares(aftermarket opportunities mostly). 

I need to broaden myself to 7 or 8 good companies, then accumulate and keep good track of their ER. I listen to all earnings calls so I dont like to do too many at once. So far im sitting at only 3(and 1 small biotech gamble). I would really like 2 more foreign companies with very strong growth outlooks and decent valuations. Then Id like to find 3 more domestic companies   which are safer and valued well. Right now I just cant find the value anywhere I look. Everything just looks overpriced. I love COST but not at 32 P/E. It always trades right at about 30 and has for years no matter the market. So that will probably be one that I start to buy at the next dip. That covers retail for me. So other than defense, financial, and retail, I need 2 more from different sectors as well. GOOGL maybe could cover US tech on its next dip, as ive liked them as a long term hold, MSFT as well. 

Does anyone have suggestions of companies that I can research? I'm not opposed to maybe even picking a good REIT, but mostly take interest in hearing about strong companies from emerging markets. I think that's where most of the growth potential is right now. ";249485;Opportunity in US or foreign stocks? Which sectors?;
ResistantOlive;1531456387;8ygyfv;;0;;0;[removed];249495;NVDA (and possible AMD) is screwed for earnings.;
ResistantOlive;1531457099;8yh106;;93;;112;"First off, we all love NVDA and it's an amazing meme stock.  A lot of us have made countless amounts of money off of these guys.  But for Q2 earnings they're fucked.

1: Take a look at these [GPU price graphs](https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/video-card/).  The trend is a huge peak and slow fall, but all of this happened before Q1 earnings, meaning their large beat in may was heavily influenced by this.  Since the beginning of february GPU prices are 30% lower.  Due to the law of supply and demand, this means that the supply was too high and the demand fell - meaning NVDA lost money on a lot of these cards.  A price drop at this scale means a large excess of inventory - i'll get to that later.

2: Cryptocurrency fad is dead for the time being.  The following is a quote from their CFO about cryptocurrency (which NVDA does not like to talk about):
&gt; “Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are included in our OEM business at $289 million,” Kress said. “Looking into Q2, we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about one-third of its Q1 level.”

Since Nvidia's total revenue was [$3.207 billion](https://s22.q4cdn.com/364334381/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2019/NVIDIA-Q1Y19-Form-10Q.pdf) in the first quarter, this means a 7% drop in revenue Q/Q due to only cryptocurrency.

3: [Gigabyte, a company which makes NVDA cards saw their revenue fall 30% in june.](http://emops.twse.com.tw/server-java/t05st10_e?TYPEK=sii&amp;step=show&amp;co_id=2376&amp;year=2018&amp;month=06) This is the most direct evidence revenues are going to massively fall, as this was right when graphics cards saw a huge price drop.  

4: [Allegedly there was an OEM who returned 300,000 GPUs back to Nvidia.](https://wccftech.com/nvidia-oem-partner-300k-gpu-inventory-issues-next-gen-geforce-delay/)  If this is true that is around $150 million in revenue lost assuming an average price of $400 per card (really rough estimate).  That's another 7% meaning these two things combined could show a 14% loss in revenue Q/Q.  This shows another instance of inventory mismanagement on NVDA's part.

All in all NVDA could see a large drop in earnings.  Due to the nature of this stock, however, there's no telling if it actually goes down after earnings.  If AMD earnings come out bad that will prove some of these points and give you a warning as to what NVDA earnings hold, so I suggest watching AMD if you will play NVDA.

Glybera;1531588625;8yut8n;;0;;1;"Hello all, I am new to reddit and decided to join this subreddit due to my passion for stock picking/finance.

I am 19 years old and have been interested in the stock market for a few years. I tend to focus on pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms. I use Robinhood and started investing with real money May 2018.

My current positions:

JNJ-19.32&amp;#37; of portfolio-2.53&amp;#37; total return

BMRN- 15.86&amp;#37; of portfolio- 16.05&amp;#37; total return

BMY- 12.72&amp;#37; of portfolio- 6.98&amp;#37; total return

CELG- 6.56&amp;#37; of portfolio- 1.30&amp;#37; total return

RETA- 3.23&amp;#37; of portfolio- 12.74&amp;#37; total return

SGMO- 2.25&amp;#37; of portfolio- -5.43&amp;#37; total return

GERN- 0.85&amp;#37; of portfolio- 2.5&amp;#37; total return

The rest is 1&amp;#37; in bitcoin (for fun) and the rest cash

Including the returns of various short term options I have bought and sold, my portfolio has returned 30.63&amp;#37; since May 12 (my ambition is to double my portfolio's starting value before 2019).

I am writing this post in favor of a long position in BMRN (BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.). BMRN has recently come into conversation again due to Orbimed's (top healthcare-focused hedge fund) decision to increase their stake in the company as well as the FDA's approval of Palynziq.

The primary reason why BMRN is LONG is because of its excellent clinical trial results regarding one of its drug candidates: BMRN-270 (often referred to as Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec... I prefer to say BMRN-270 lol).

The results can be found: [http://investors.biomarin.com/2017-07-11-BioMarins-Investigational-Gene-Therapy-for-Hemophilia-A-at-6e13-vg-kg-Dose-Maintains-Average-Factor-VIII-Levels-within-Normal-Range-for-over-One-Year](http://investors.biomarin.com/2017-07-11-BioMarins-Investigational-Gene-Therapy-for-Hemophilia-A-at-6e13-vg-kg-Dose-Maintains-Average-Factor-VIII-Levels-within-Normal-Range-for-over-One-Year)

The above shows stunningly good results and should bring hope to those with a severe case of Hemophilia A. After being injected with BMRN-270, patients saw a steady increase of their Factor VIII proteins (the lack of Factor VIII proteins causes Hem A). Currently, those suffering from Hem A have to inject themselves weekly with Factor VIII proteins, the fact that BMRN-270 only requires a single injection (and perhaps a booster shot) surely will make life more convenient for Hem A patients (not the mention the fact that BMRN-270 can make the patient produce his/her own Factor VIII proteins).

I constructed a patient population model to find the value of BMRN-270 if approved (considering many different aspects such as market penetration/competition, frequency of Hem A, average revenue per patient for drug that deals with similar patient population sizes, risk, etc) and came out with a rough Net Present Value of $8B for the US market alone (the value more than doubles assuming approval in EU and Japan markets). Thus, because the drug is likely to be approved and shows enormous profit potential once marketed, I strongly believe that BMRN will continue to raise in value (to at least about $140).

If interested I can further elaborate on why BMRN is a good LONG (have not talked fundamentals or balance sheet).

Happy investing!

Looking forward to sharing some more info and advice

Criticism is encouraged

Wall Street harshly punished Twitter stock when the news broke, with a big sell-off before cooler heads prevailed. Here's why Twitter's move is a poor reason to sell shares.

This is without accounting for the borrowing costs attributable to his 15 short positions.

Here is a graph of the portfolios performance on a monthly basis: [https://imgur.com/a/5kKx5II](https://imgur.com/a/5kKx5II)

Portfolio positions were last shown in his ""This Week in Investing and Finance - Episode 21"" uploaded on September 10, just 3 days before his bail was revoked and he was sent to jail. Here is a photo of the positions being shown in said video: [https://imgur.com/a/37nLdbq](https://imgur.com/a/37nLdbq)

The secret short position was Axovant ($AXON), which he uploaded nearly 7 hours worth of videos on how to analyze a critical trial and his reasoning behind why it would fail its upcoming clinical trial. AXON ended up falling over 70&amp;#37; two weeks later after it failed its late-stage trial.

2. High switching costs: Because of JD Plus and the ancillary services associated with it, the company's membership program could gain moderately high switching costs, as no one in China can offer the same shipping deals as JD.

3. Network effect: With an established fulfillment network, JD established a separate entity in April 2017 -- JD Logistics. As more people flock to JD's site, third-party vendors are incentivized to list on JD and use JD Logistics for fulfillment. This draws even more Chinese customers to the platform -- creating a virtuous cycle.

“Mr. Xia had been an early investor of KULR,” said KULR co-founder and CEO, Michael Mo. “Our company and technology will greatly benefit by his wealth of knowledge, experience, and relationships in the electronics and battery industry in China, as he becomes more actively involved with us.”

In addition to his leadership position with BYD, Xia founded Zhengxuan Capital in 2004, an investment firm with over 10 billion RMD ($1.5 billion USD) in assets under management. He was named to the 2018 Forbes China Rich List, with an estimated net worth $1.1 billion USD. Among more than 30 investments under Zhengxuan Capital, Xia is a Director and early investor in robotics company [UBTech](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fubtrobot.com&amp;esheet=51835174&amp;newsitemid=20180711005613&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=UBTech&amp;index=6&amp;md5=74c8ddb10102c96c70bb1a88cd9238bb), which is the world’s most valuable consumer robotics company at $5 billion valuation.

“I have always believed in KULR’s technology to solve challenging thermal problems,” said Xia. “What KULR is doing with batteries, vehicles, and other markets is really important and I look forward to contributing to their growth.”

KULR recently executed an [exclusive agreement](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20180326005764%2Fen%2FKULR-Technology-Exclusively-Commercialize-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Safety&amp;esheet=51835174&amp;newsitemid=20180711005613&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=exclusive+agreement&amp;index=7&amp;md5=55812ad34a7d8dd66319ecd3e611e277) with NASA and the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) to commercialize the internal short circuit device (ISC). The ISC, creates predictable lithium-ion cell failures in lab conditions where those failures can be studied and safety technology can be developed and tested. ISC failure testing is the NASA standard for battery safety for crewed space flight.

Starting to get my feet wet in the market and trying to take in as much as I can.  One stock that I've kept an eye on is Phillip Morris.  It's done great in my portfolio as it had a gain of 7-8% in less than a month until today.  They released their Q2 earnings today and their EPS is actually up 24% to $1.41 a share compared to Q2 2K17.  I am just clueless as to what caused this drop as I am sure I am suffering from tunnel vision. 

 I know they had a shitty PR stunt where they offered their help to try and make every NHS employee ""quit smoking"" by advertising their new heated tobacco products instead of actually trying to get them to quit smoking.  I am also aware of the general uncertainty surrounding the company as no one knows whether how they will adapt to the increase of e-cig use.

**Space-designed, light-weight carbon fiber is coming to drone racing and, soon, commercial drones and electric vehicles**

July 19, 2018 10:31 AM Eastern Daylight Time

CAMPBELL, Calif.--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--[KULR Technology Corp](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kulrtechnology.com%2F&amp;esheet=51839858&amp;newsitemid=20180719005532&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=KULR+Technology+Corp&amp;index=1&amp;md5=a1b5f17e2beb6734811fde63e869624a), a subsidiary of KT High-Tech Marketing Inc. (OTC: KUTG), announced today that it will be the Technology Advisor for [DR1](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dr1racing.tv%2F&amp;esheet=51839858&amp;newsitemid=20180719005532&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=DR1&amp;index=2&amp;md5=2dca01635581f74b3646c73f10eae2ed), the premier high-performance international and invitational drone racing circuit.

As the league’s Technical Advisor, KULR will work with drone designers, engineers, and pilots to deploy the company’s space-used and NASA-developed carbon fiber technology – helping DR1 push technical boundaries in speed, weight, and safety.

“We’re excited by this partnership,” said KULR’s CEO Michael Mo. “The DR1 league is already skirting the very limits of drone and electric vehicle performance and, with our space-flight carbon fiber, together we can do some things that will really blow people away.”

KULR’s core technology is a vertically-aligned carbon fiber material that is lighter, more flexible and more efficient than traditional thermal management products. The fiber solutions replace legacy cooling options such as fans, metal plates and liquid pump systems – things that don’t work too well on racing drones. KULR’s cooling systems can be used to cool drone cameras, fast quadrotors and batteries. The combined uses of the KULR fiber in dissipating heat from sensitive components and reducing the risks associated with battery failure will help make DR1’s racing drones faster and safer.

“Together we’re going to make DR1 drones into remote-piloted lightning,” Mo said. “But it’s not just about racing and winning – there will be a ton of testing, learning and innovating along the way,” he said.

That’s a familiar pattern. Just as innovations in high-performance IndyCar racing spawned [many advances](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fid%2F43074652%2Fns%2Fbusiness-autos%2Ft%2Ftop-indycar-technologies%2F%23.WyLbxadKjIU&amp;esheet=51839858&amp;newsitemid=20180719005532&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=many+advances&amp;index=3&amp;md5=dd91fd7ca6120e5f97bc6482c6074e34) in consumer automotive design and safety, technology solutions pioneered and tested through the KULR/DR1 partnership will eventually improve the safety and efficiency of many products such as electric cars, robotics, commercial drones, and millions of consumer electronics.

“It’s going to be a great, high-impact partnership,” DR1 Founder and CEO Brad Foxhoven said. “We want every crumb of power, speed, agility and ability from our racing drones and, with KULR Technology on board as our Technology Advisors, we’re absolutely going to get that – improving the sport, the fan experience and the technology in the process.”

DR1 has previously held races around the world and sealed television and sponsorship agreements with CBS, Fox Sports, DHL, Mountain Dew and others.

Nothing has changed fundamentally with this company though. Volvo just reported huge numbers yesterday with their truck sales in North America and everywhere for that matter. Volvo in general is just looking 10x better. The cars are looking better, driving better, tech speaking they are innovative and cutting edge. Not to mention they look like they'll be having an IPO sooner rather than later with a Market Cap expected to be around $30 million, all good things for Geely one would assume.

Hey Ya! Remember the early 2000s? It was all about lace-up jeans, giant cargo shorts, Gilmore Girls, Lord of the Rings, the Atkins Diet ... and the BlackBerry.

Long before the iPhone, the BlackBerry was the most beloved mobile gadget in the universe, known especially for its reliability, its security, and its full keyboard. But Research In Motion, the company that made it, didn't change quickly enough with the times, and the sweet fruit of its labors went sour. The company renamed itself BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) in early 2013 and set on a course of reinvention — first around smartphones, and then around software. Many people wrote it off.

And that's where we see a major opportunity.

BlackBerry has been quietly accelerating in its new mission securing all the connected devices that the modern world increasingly relies on. You've heard of the Internet of Things, chips embedded in all the stuff around us transmitting a wealth of data? Call the business angle ""the Enterprise of Things."" BlackBerry's new focus still draws on its expertise in endpoint security, which shows us the fruit hasn't fallen so far from the tree. But this time around, it's securing things like self-driving vehicles, emergency health networks, financial reporting, and much more.

If your image of BlackBerry is stuck in the past, read on. This is a company with a future.

Second Bloom
It's no surprise that most investors would pass BlackBerry by after a quick glance. Revenue has declined every year since 2011 — and even then, the company's share price was far below the peak of nearly $150 that it reached in mid-2008.

But this is, quite simply, an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember, and its turnaround is just starting to take hold. Moreover, the company's progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren't part of management's vision or our investment thesis going forward.

BlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid-2016, and there are still BlackBerry-branded devices available, so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business. Service access fees (SAF), related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems, are also dwindling. Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50% of revenue in fiscal 2017, their continued decline has been keenly felt.

But the meat of the current business, Software and Services, has grown at an average annual pace of 15% over the past three years, reaching $782 million in fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends in February). This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry, and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter.

The company's QNX operating system, in particular, has been driving growth. Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems, it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle, including safety and communications. BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and others around this technology. Baidu, in turn, has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform, and has partnered with automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles.

This certainly isn't the only area where BlackBerry's business is growing, but it's emblematic of the niche the company is carving out: securing endpoints in the Internet of Things, with a particular focus on enterprises. It has been a leader in Gartner's (NYSE: IT) Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years, making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that's expected to grow revenue at a 25% annual pace through 2021.

That hasn't yet put BlackBerry in the black, but it's building the core of a very profitable business.

Since being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013, BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet, with $2.2 billion in cash and $810 million in convertible debt (which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid). Gross margin improved from 49% in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73% in fiscal 2018, indicating not only the company's shift from hardware to software, but also some considerable pricing power. Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year (it did last year, too, albeit thanks to a large one-time adjustment).

Add it up and this is a $5.4 billion company currently generating around $800 million in very high-margin software revenue (leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses), with over 80% of that revenue recurring. With a gross margin that improved to 76% in the most recent quarter, we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20% to 25% range, even as the top line continues to grow. That looks like an attractive price point.

Risks and When We'd Sell
There are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry's financials, but the surface picture remains unflattering. For the time being, this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability. Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business, but scaling the business so that BlackBerry's relatively high sales, marketing, and R&amp;D costs come down as a percentage of revenue.

The company is a leader in a growing sector, but its competitors — companies like IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and others — have a lot of resources. That's why it's important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles, but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas, too.

The Foolish Bottom Line
Not every turnaround works, but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA. This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus, and at this point he says the company is ""largely done reinventing itself"" and ready to focus on furthering its leadership. Chen should know — he's a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.

Whether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected ""things"" safe and secure. The best part is that many investors can't see the green shoots growing from the rotten fruit of a decade past. That's a sweet opportunity.";251314;The new Stock Advisor recommendation from Motley Fool and write-up(only two stocks are delivered every month for subscribers to this service);

Goal1;1532101755;90h3sg;;9;;20;"Here is all that I’ve digested in the past from reading Chapters 1-15 of Peter Lynch’s, One Up on Wall Street. It’s very dry cut but it has helped me out and I believe it can help newer investors!

Words of Wisdom Chapters 1-15

Stay away from DiWORSEification. Make sure a company isn’t investing into things it doesn’t understand. Find companies that focus on what they’re good at (niche).

You know more than Wall Street investors. Possible stock purchases are in front of you. Look around and pay attention to your surroundings. Look locally. Try products. Get a taste when you can. Know people in industries and ask them what’s selling or doing well. Ask friends and family. 

It’s good to have the institutional ownership at a lower number rather than a higher number. As Acquirers Multiple would say, be different, Zig when others Zag. 

Just because a company works in one state, doesn’t mean it will work somewhere else. Sometimes waiting to see if their growth will be the same on more of a national level isn’t a bad idea at all. 

The investors relations office isn’t just for the pros. Get questions ready and studied, then make a call to the company you’re interested in buying. Two good questions. If unsure the good question always is, “What are the positives this year and what are negatives?”

Look at current assets and take the cash figure and add it-to the marginal securities. This gives you the total overall cash position. Socking away money is a sign of prosperity. 

Check the debt. Lowering debt is also a sign of prosperity. When cash is increasing and debt is decreasing is what we want. Our cash - debt is our NET cash position. 

It’s important to know what each product means to the company. How much of their profits come from this product? 

You want a PE ratio at half the growth rate is positive. PE at twice growth rate is very negative. (PEG =&lt;1)

Debt determines the survivability of a company. Bank debt and funded debt. Bank is worse because it’s due on demand. Bank is due sooner also he can ask for it whenever he sees trouble. Funded is best debt. As long as interest is being paid, the business can’t be forced to immediately repay it.  

Dividend paying is good! Dividends that don’t pay dividends can waste money on diWORSEification. Dividends create a positive aura. Stops stocks from falling as much if they didn’t have a dividend. 

Lower debt still more important than dividend paying. 

Book value understates or overstates actual value because a company realistically won’t be able to sell assets for as much as balance sheets show. But remember that the debt in the sheets will always, always beed to be paid. 

There can be hidden assets such as assets not being projected by interest gain. Company might buy gold at $500 five years ago. Now it’s worth $700. They will still show it on balance sheets as $500. That’s a hidden asset. 

Cash flow is amount of money in result of doing business. Look for companies that don’t need to spend as much cash to stay competitive. Cash flow needs to be looked at ‘free cash flow’ for this reason. 

You don’t want inventory buildup. Inventory growing faster than sales is a bad sign. Two types of inventory reports on balance sheets. LIFO AND FIFO ( last in first out. First in first out )

Growth is not synonymous with expansion.  Earnings is the most important metric for growth. 

Recheck companies story every couple months. 3 phases of a growth company. Startup phase, rapid expansion ,and mature phase (saturation phase)

First phase is riskiest, Where stock is growing and finding its ground. Second phase is when they are really performing. This is where you make most money) third phase is when the company needs to innovate to keep making more money.

Example is ABv for beer. They own over 40% of beer market. They are a phase 3 business. They must find innovation. 

FINAL CHECKLIST:

P/E needs to be compared at industry level. Is it lower or higher? 

Institutional ownership low!

Insider buys and buybacks are positive signs!

Are earnings consistent?

What is debt to equity ratio?

What’s their free cash position?

Have dividends always been paid and routinely raised?

If you’re holding long term make sure to check long term growth rate and how they do during market declines and recessions. 

Cyclical companies you must pay attention to the inventory levels.

Check for fast growers that their supposed enriching product is a big part of their actual business. 

Check to see if a company has room to grow. How does the PE ratio compare to the earnings growth?

Do they have enough cash to come out positive in a liquidation?

Big companies make small moves. Small companies make big moves. Look for smaller companies that are already profitable and have a proven concept. 

Stay out of ‘hot’ stocks in hot industries. Invest in out of favor, dull mundane companies. 

The ideal investments are companies with niches. Moderate fast grower should have 20-25% growth are ideal investments. 

When checking depressed stocks. Look for ones with superior financial situations. Stay away from ones with a lot of debt. 

Look for companies that consistently buy back their own shares. Insider buying is a positive sign. A watched stock never boils!

This turned out to be something of a Rorschach test, which was not my intention. I just thought it was a powerful visual. I wasn’t really trying to make a point, certainly not the point that many thought I was going for.

The reason I made that chart was because I was working on this post today, which will  attempt to show that there are plenty of other stocks outside of FAANG that are doing just fine. That tweet had the opposite effect. Hopefully this will remedy that.

The chart below shows the average returns of S&amp;P 500 stocks year-to-date broken down by market cap decile. The first decile is the 50 largest stocks, the second decile is the next 50 largest stocks, and so on. You can plainly see that while the mega caps are performing well, and powering the index higher, there are other stocks that are doing just fine. The 4th, 6th, and 7th deciles are performing better than the 2nd and 3rd.

It is pretty wild to think that the five largest stocks are as large as the bottom 282 S&amp;P 500 stocks, but the truth is, this is how a cap weighted index works. Yum! Brands can triple and it still would not move the needle of the index as much as if Apple gains 1%.

We are not in uncharted territory. The Pareto Principle is a feature of financial markets, not a bug.

I am trying to understand how the news about a company's acquisition/ earnings/any other information propagates ?

For example ,for earnings I follow SEC filings and but opening and reading all the filings is cumbersome and probably will take all day before I could decide one specific stock to buy.

So let's so your company is worth $100, you go public.  You let the public take a 50% stake in the company, so let's say you make $50 on the IPO. Could you just pocket that money if you wanted to? And, if you do what every company does, which is put that money back into the business, isn't your company suddenly worth a shitload more than it was before?

**Know when to fold 'em: Foolish selling principles for long-term investors**

By Ron Gross and Andy Cross

One of the most common questions our analysts get from member Fools is: **How do I know when to sell a stock?**

Our chief investment officer, Andy Cross, and our director of value investing, Ron Gross, talked through their answers at a recent member event. Here's an edited version of that conversation.

**Andy Cross:** There's an investing adage on Wall Street saying: ""There are numerous reasons to sell a stock, but there's really only one reason to buy it — because you think it's going higher."" But selling is a little bit more nuanced.

**Ron Gross:** Let's talk about some **misconceptions about selling** before we get into the real reasons why we think it'd be fair to sell.

**Bad reason 1: ""The stock market correction is coming""**

**Ron:** I don't know about you, but my crystal ball has been broken for quite some time. And if history has taught us anything, it's that it's pretty much impossible to correctly predict the stock market. You'll see someone who says, ""The market is way too high. Move to cash."" Then the next year, the stock market is up 20%. That's a very painful decision, not only because of transaction costs but because of capital gains taxes that could be triggered if it's in a nonretirement account.

And statistics show that — you can pick your period of time from 5 to 20 years — **a fair amount of returns are based on a small amount of days.**Days where the stock market has had a significant run-up. And if you happen to be out of the market on just a handful of those days, you will significantly underperform the S&amp;P 500. My crystal ball just doesn't tell me when to get in and get out on the proper days, so it behooves us all to stay invested for the long term.

**Bad reason 2: ""I'm losing money"" / ""I'm making money""**

**Andy:** I hear this from friends and family members all the time. ""Bought a stock at $26 three weeks ago, and now it's at $23. I think I'm getting out. I have a floor price I put in; I'm losing money and I'm going to sell the stock.""

**Ron:** The stock **market doesn't care what price you paid for a stock**, by the way. All of your future returns in any stock you own will be based on the future. None of it will be based on the past, so you have to evaluate where you are today, or a stock price is today, and where the company goes from here. The past is irrelevant to all investment decisions.

The same thing goes for ""I'm making money."" Just because you're up on a stock doesn't mean you'll continue to go up. Doesn't mean you'll go down. Doesn't indicate anything, really, because that, again, is based on the past, and the past is over. You have to look to the future for all investment returns.

**Bad reason 3: ""I'll just get back to break-even and then I'm going to sell""**

**Ron:** That doesn't work. Usually what's going on is that the company is doing something that is not going well, and you're just hanging on because you hate the concept of taking a loss. What ends up happening is**you often end up taking a bigger loss** because the company isn't operating appropriately.

Taking a loss can be painful. Psychology shows us that it's more painful than the benefits of a gain, but sometimes it's necessary if you're not feeling right about where a company is going.

**Bad reason 4: ""The company cut its dividend""**

**Ron:** Paying a dividend is a capital allocation decision by the board of directors and the management team. Most of us like a nice dividend, and when it gets cut, usually a stock will take a hit because there's usually a reason for it.

If it is a good reason — if it is a capital allocation decision that makes sense (a company should really do it to shore up its balance sheet, or a company needs to retain more cash, at least for the time being) — that's a smart decision. It might be painful in the short term, but it's smart.

If a company decides it wants to go into acquisition mode and needs more cash on its balance sheet, then, again, it's a smart time to cut. Just the **knee-jerk reaction of a dividend cut should not be a reason to sell.** You have to look under the hood to see why management is doing so.

**Bad reason 5: ""My stop-loss order kicked in""**

**Andy:** We're not fans of those, typically. We don't think this is a good way to buy and exit stocks — to set prices like that \[where brokerage actions\] kick in if a stock goes below a certain price. Try not to use them. There are better ways to buy and sell your stocks, including options. We're not big fans of a stop-loss order.

**Ron:** In my hedge fund days, I never used stop-loss orders because I wanted to be in control of every investment decision. I didn't want anything to happen automatically, and if you have a stop-loss order, **you could get sold out of a stock when you really didn't want that to happen.**

Very often, we'll see a headline come out in the morning that a stock is down 10% before the market opens. Then the market opens with the stock down 10-12%. But then the company holds a conference call an hour later, and the stock comes back because the news wasn't as bad as the headline indicated ... but you've already been stop-lossed out of that company. You're like, ""Darn, I really shouldn't have sold that.""

**The bottom line on selling**

**Andy:** The simple truth is **you make more money buying and holding than you do buying and trading.** Individual investors trade way too much. But if you buy correctly, selling hopefully takes care of itself — meaning you don't have to worry about it so much if you have the right framework. The goal we set for the Fool's Partnership Portfolio is 6X/10Y, trying to identify companies that have the potential to earn 6x their value over the next 10 years. That's about a 20% annualized return.

Multibaggers can be game-changing, and it's really painful to sell out of a stock that goes on to generate multibagger returns. They can really change your portfolio and your life. Don't sell — or at least aim to sell very rarely.

And ... there's a big, old ""but."" **There are times and reasons to sell**, so let's get to it.

**Selling makes good sense if ...**

**The fundamentals of the company have changed.** If the underlying business has deteriorated or you believe it will, that's certainly a reason to look at not owning that company. This could be revenues, margins, or profit declining, or now there's a loss at the company. Any of those reasons could indicate that profit could be coming down in the future — it may not be a company you want to own.

**The competitive landscape has changed.** Think twice if a new competitor comes into a marketplace or an existing competitor ends up having the upper hand. If you own a company that is not going to be grabbing market share in the future and its share is going to continue to deteriorate, that will hit the fundamentals, and that will hit profit.

**A platform shift threatens your investment.** You've heard of Kodak. That was a company that did not benefit from a shift. We're talking about big, trending ideas. Paradigm-shifting trends would be good if we could all recognize them. Sometimes we recognize these a little late, but still better late than never!

**You need your money in the next three years.** In this case, your portfolio should not be fully invested. It's inappropriate, in our opinion, to have all your money in the market in this situation because you will not have the time to weather a severe correction, which inevitably will come. That's our best advice for that.

**A position becomes too large.** ""Too large"" is in the eye of the beholder. For some, that's 5-7%. For others, think above 10%. If a stock became more than 10% of your portfolio, would you be okay with that? And from the perspective of letting your winners run, hopefully those stocks naturally gravitate and make up more and more of your portfolio, and the losers make up less and less. That's what you want to see. Warren Buffett has talked about this, too. Those big stocks make up a larger and larger percentage of your portfolio, but it really is down to each individual investor and what you feel comfortable with.

**You find a better opportunity.** If you are managing a fixed portfolio (not adding money to it), you ideally want it to be full of your best ideas at all times. And if you're fortunate to uncover a great idea, you may have to make a tough decision to sell your worst idea — even though you may still like it — to free up capital for the new opportunity.

**You need to rebalance.** This largely is based on your life experience where, let's say, as you're getting older, you don't want as much exposure to stocks. Bonds may be appropriate. Cash may be appropriate. Alternative vehicles other than stocks may make sense to you. In those circumstances, rebalancing (reducing your position in stocks and increasing your position in other types of investments) may be necessary. It may help you sleep at night. It may optimize your returns better for your stage of life.

**You disagree with the ethics of the company.** At The Motley Fool, we try not to put our ethics into our recommendations, because everyone is different, but I do encourage you to take your ethics and morality into account when building your portfolio. It's perfectly acceptable to take your own ethics into account, and if something changes about the way a company does business — and you don't like it — it may be time to say good-bye.

And finally ...

**You need to put your investing dollars to use.** We invest to make money for ourselves — for our future, our families. So if you need that money for some reason (your family income situation has changed, or you want to buy a home), you're going to have to sell some stocks. Even David Gardner did a few years ago when he was switching homes! (He told members about it, of course.) If you need to use the money, most likely you'll have to sell some stocks. And that's okay!

I'm no stock investing guru. 

When I was youjnger I even took investing tips from a local security guard and bought Hasbro when Episode I was released from his ""hot tip"" and took a $2k bath. Ever since then, the pain was still hot and fresh, and told myself never to follow anyone.

Everything I learned, I just read books and learned by trial and error. So if this sounds like a big pile of manure, my apologies in advance for the doo-doo.

I'm starting a video series on security analysis using Python / data science. It's completely free and doing it purely from the perspective of teaching. Maybe python is overkill but heck, i find it useful so maybe other people do too. I live &amp; breathe python &amp; data analysis as an AI engineer, so this is bit easier since i deal with data in terabytes every day (but video editing is surely NOT easy).

I used to be big into algorithmic trading, until one day, I looked at my algos returns and realized even though they did pretty decent, all the trading fees basically ate up big chunk of the returns to the point that there was no point in trading, and instead buying an index fund made a whole lot more sense. ;/

Since then I've been more active in the 3 fund portfolio (VTSAX, VTBLX, and the VTIAX). But started moving slowly into my own portfolio of equities. This is some of the automation I've been working on as personal project.

If you don't like excel, or don't like doing manual data entry.. you're the person i'm talking to.

What I plan to cover:

\- using python / jupyter notebook to read in, comment, and visualize data

\- analyzing financial statements - and how to connect the dots with charts / graphs

\- how to automate the whole thing so you don't have to do this every time 10q/10k comes out

\- how to templatize so you can screen stocks much faster

I don't know if this is interesting or useful, but I thought I would put it out there.

Oh yeah, and i'm doing this completely feed-driven - your feedback / ideas / suggestions will determine what I make.

If you like it, I would appreciate if you subscribed to my channel, as well as an upvote on reddit.

The toy maker earned 48 cents per share for the second quarter, well above the consensus estimate of 29 cents. Revenue was also well above estimates. The performance came despite a drop in profit and revenue from a year ago due largely to the bankruptcy and liquidation of the Toys R Us chain.

 They require basically no credit score and only 10k from the buyer to purchase a car. The majority of their sales are subprime. And they are basically at the mercy of their financial backers who they offload all these loans to. But their stock continues to grow. Even though their financials are well eh. 

Personally I think the auto industry has a rocky road ahead. With surplus vehicles in both used and new sectors and the increasing number of subprime loans, defaults, repossessions, and delinquencies it's hard to believe they will stay afloat for the next decade.

This made me start questioning silver and its rise in 2011. History has shown that both times silver has risen in a Bull market during a recession,and from what I am understanding, we are currently in a Bull market now. I've been noticing SLV has slowly been making its way down close to where it was back in 2008. My question to all of you is if we were to go into a recession within the next year or 2, what do you expect to happen with SLV? Do y'all think we will continue to remain in a Bull market for the next year or 2? Like I said, this is all new to me. I wish i could find some good instruction on all of this.

They have had a monopoly on the market for well over a decade. They just obliterated their ER by like 10%.

I still have absolutely NO fucking idea what I'm doing, but both SQ and FB are in the green. My question is, should I wait until after earnings for FB to sell or before earnings (if it runs up)?

2. Top players listed in the US are Yirendai (YRD), Hexindai (HX), Qudian (QD), LexinFintech (LX)
3. The government has been regulating the consumer lending market in China and this has resulted in several fraudulent companies being shut down (around 4k companies shut down in 2017)
4. Govt is also capping the interest rates being charged by the investors. This has resulted in investors withdrawing from the platforms as they see better opportunities elsewhere
5. Defaults are also growing as the industry expands and the average risk level of the borrower goes up
6. Questions have also been raised on the financial audits of the listed players
7. All of this has resulted in 50-60% decline stock prices over the past 4-5 months, leading to extremely low P/E, PEG levels on account of high growth rates, high margins

When I first started out, I saw so money different companies I wanted to invest in, and began to acquire positions in most of them. What I ended up with was around 15/16 positions with cost bases averaging around $500; with $5/trade commission fees, I'd have to make 2% just to break even. Likewise, if I made a 10% gain on a single position, it only translated to about $50 of unrealized gain. I learned that with my limited amount of capital, I had to consolidate my positions and just pick a handful of companies that I was super confident investing in. After a while, it meant that the gains I made in stock value were far more substantial, even if their percentage increases were smaller.";252674;Your biggest mistake?;

michniea;1532533824;91t0cv;;5;;1;"Anybody else thinking about buying puts on Spotify? 

Couple things that have me convinced this stock is running out of fuel:

Competition: How can this App compete against Apple music and Google's youtube Music? Apple and google can easily pay for royalties to artists, Spotify, not so much. They are bleeding money paying for this, as their last earnings report showed. It seems unsustainable at best.

Apple music has 50 million subscribers and catching up to spotify's 75 million, at a higher growth rate than Spotify's.

I personally use Google's service. They've been able to use all of their existing platforms to create music streaming services that has just boosted their recent earnings release. (I could not find number of subscribers though, this is probably because they had multiple related services that they've only recently condensed into one).

Also, Google's youtube services are just about the only option for foreign music. Most bilingual people I know can't find their second languages music on anything but Youtube, including myself.

And to top it all off, Google and Apple like to combine all their subscriptions into one unified, synced, platform, instead of one independent app.

NineteenEighty9;1532546321;91uwgb;Off-Topic;46;;55;"The US Dollar is the primary global reserve currency and represents over 60%(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#United_States_dollar) of all reserve currencies held by other countries. The dollar is considered the safest currency in the world because it’s guaranteed by the United States. The Dollar is widely accepted for purchases globally. Countries around the world, like China have accumulated massive reserves of dollars because this allows them to create their own currency for spending purposes and its accepted by other countries because they know if China can’t pay its bills it can always borrow money, because dollars are a hard asset accepted everywhere even if its own currency is not. The US Dollar is called a fiat currency for this reason (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp).

Because it’s currency is in such high demand means that the United States gets to play by a unique set of rules when it comes to borrowing. The majority of the national debt is owed to either the Fed or the American public (mostly represented by their pension or investment assets). In this regard the national debt is a positive thing because it creates a safe asset for investors and pension plans to save in to help manage their investment risk while receiving a modest return. The US has only run a budget surplus a handful of years since the WW2. The ability of the Fed to control interest rates means if debt servicing ever becomes a serious issue they can raise inflation thus decreasing the value of each Dollar (within reason given the economic situation at the time). Essentially the US can inflate away the value of the national debt over the long term as compared to GDP even if the actual dollar amount of debt never decreases. Each dollar is worth much less now then when they borrowed it years before. 1, 5 or 10 year bond means the government agreed to borrow that money from you for that period for an interest rate set by the market, interest is typically paid when the bond matures.

A far better way to examine the debt is using something called Debt to GDP ratio. It uses a percentage to compare the total national debt to 1 year of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The media will cite the current US debt to GDP ratio as alarming because it is over 100% of GDP, the highest since WW2. But debt to GDP ratio doesn’t tell the whole story, we have to look at debt servicing costs as well. You may be able to afford a $250,000 mortgage if the interest rate is 3%, but if it’s 20% all of a sudden a $100,000 house can become out of your price range because the monthly payment (debt servicing cost) would be so high. It’s true that the national debt has almost doubled as a percentage of GDP over the past couple decades. However because we’ve been in a prolonged low interest rate environment even though the US is borrowing record amounts of money, it’s paying less of a debt servicing cost today for twice the debt it had a decade or so ago. As long as rates remain low they can continue to borrow within reason. Should the debt get to high and the market get scared it will raise US borrowing costs and force the government to cut spending and the cycle repeats, this has happened many times in the past.

Americans represent around 4% of the global population but own almost 40% of global wealth. The United States has a national net worth (assets - debts/liabilities) of $93.5 Trillion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_wealth).
How that wealth is distributed is a totally different debate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient).

In part this wealth comes from the US economic system which creates trillions of dollars per year in tangible wealth but also from its geographic location. This article expands on that further (http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/16/how-geography-explains-the-united-states/). The current global order is governed by an imperfect system of rules and laws that are enforced by independent bodies that each nation state is a member of (UN, IMF, World Bank, WTO etc…) , but for the most part functions very well. It allows for freedom of navigation for any nation to freely trade with another without interference from another nation (over 90% of global trade is shipping). This has meant global trade has prospered and no country are benefited from this more then the US. The global system is underpinned by the enormous US military, especially the Navy who conducts regular freedom of navigation operations around the world to enforce free shipping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_navigation#United_States_""Freedom_of_Navigation""_program).

The US is often criticized for high military spending but this could arguably be justified because the status quo benefits America more then any other nation. But they’re also picking up the tab. Countries like China and Russia are actively working to undermine the current international order. Corruption thrives in those nations and in a rules based system it’s much harder to escape justice, people like Vladimir Putin don’t like this because they like to play by their own rules.";252760;"US spending &amp; national debt aren’t issues if you’re in investing long term";

rachmaninova;1532596554;920pjj;;11;;2;"i see lots of wrong assumptions here in the sub about facebook..

one user even said facebook announced it was ""dying"".. and that interpretation is totally off point

they basically said that the european uers have shrunk due to the new regulations.

FB has been growing frenetically and stock rised without stop because facebook went the walmart way of trying to be an asshat and users increased because there was no boundaries and no enforcement.

now the zuck has pledged to harden the  core infrastructure: to put barriers to hate speech and shit, to filter abuse and stuff. that of course costs money and will also surely cost users (those who enjoy the platform due to the lack of rule enforcement)

up to now facebook was known for being a law free space.. it was going the WorldStarHipHop way.

hardening the core  costs money and the zuck is pledging to put so much money that the impact will be felt over the next years. you gotta give it to the zuck that he is pledging harder than he minimum required.

what could happen?

it seems facebook is honestly trying to become reputable. that can lead to it becoming a true platform for people or it can lead to its young base to leave as it also will become boring thus going the MySpace way (although MP went tits up because of the unusable UI and it was full WorldStart at some point.

Another big fail example was Digg.. which is the site that basically started social aggregation. reddit copycated them and was  number 2 for a long time.. then Digg changed the UI and basically all users migrated to reddit. today www.[digg.com](https://222digg.com) is a graveyard.

Reddit itself did the same coming of age transition: back in the day reddit was getting known for its manhunts and witch burnings the lowest point being the \[boston marathon bombing fiasco and the manhunts that followed\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/3xa62d/the\_thread\_2015\_the\_story\_of\_reddits\_manhunt\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/3xa62d/the_thread_2015_the_story_of_reddits_manhunt_that/))

It also had several subreddits that were bordering HARD on ilegallity (several pedophile and hate subs). Those subreddits had been tolerated for years and were going the 4chan way.

actually tolerating those practices is a part of what made reddit big since that kind of content attracted also young people.

reddit then pledged to change its image: started moderating heavilty against manhunts and witch hunts. it also started a crackdown against gray area subreddits.

one can say reddit managed to turn around and myspace tanked.

Reddit is the biggest aggregator today altough its growth also slowed since the turn around.

FB is huge and if the zuck manages to turn the ship in the right direction one day maybe the zuck will turn around from being seen as evil into being seen as a great philantropist. 

You know who was seen as one big evil guy and now is loved by everyone? Bill Gates.

what are your thoughts on the development of the company and the Stock impact? i personally think FB is too big to fail at this point. a few months ago FB lost value due to the cambridge stuff but after the big scare it rose to higher value.

one important thing to remember: this loss on growth is not due to outer impact but die to them choosing to do so.

The_Sliding_Lion;1532615699;922scx;;4;;1;"Hi!

So for the last two weeks or so I've been trying to teach myself day trading and investing in general. To do so, I've created a thinkorswim paper trading account. So far the experience has been great and I feel like I'm learning but there's one thing that concerns me.

The way I get filled or not, and at which price seems really weird to me. For example, my sell limit orders never get filled even if I'm trading a stock with a lot of volume. Yesterday I tried selling 500 shares of a $3 stock. The current volume bar thing below the current minute candle was 100,000. But I even if I tried lowering the price to absurd levels like $2 I never got filled. And when I got frustrated and hit the sell market button it sold instantly but 20 cents under the bid.

Same thing with buy market orders, sometimes I get filled like a dollar over the current price (on a penny stock) or a dollar under.

Is that realistic or just some weird software issue? Market orders should get filled somewhere around the bid right?

Thanks a lot in advance guys!

ObscuredByClouds95;1532622592;923rra;;1;;7;"Hello Reddit!

I'm new to investing and the stock market. I've recently gotten into the habit of reading 10-Qs and 10-Ks of different companies. It's really cool to see the break down of how different companies work. I was wondering how these reports effect if a stock breaks out or not. Obviously Facebook's plummet was related to the Quarterly report from yesterday combined with the whole date selling ordeal. How much of an effect does this have on other stocks? 

Do these jumps happen because large entities pull out or because of smaller investors? Can you make money on the stock market by analyzing how stocks react to the annual and quarterly reports? Is there a way to get the quarterly information before it is released? Would that be considered insider trading? Are there certain indicators that can predict upcreaping movement in a stock?

&gt;Investors should question the financials behind IQ before investing. Without a doubt, many will like the subscriber growth rates and higher revenues that come with iQiyi. Still, investors need to remain aware of its troubled financial statements.

&gt;The inability to cover immediate expenses as well as its mysterious funding sources should create concern.

&gt;Admittedly, just because iQiyi’s funding sources remain unknown does not mean it engages in nefarious financial activities. However, investors can also buy into other up-and-coming companies who do not bear this financial risk. Given the options available, I see no reason to risk precious capital on IQ stock.

xelephonte;1532642086;926lz3;;6;;0;"If these past 24 hours taught Mark Zuckerberg anything, I would suspect its to diversify his wealth. Most people don’t lose $15.6 billion in one day though of course even the wealthiest don’t have anywhere near that kind of wealth. So, assuming Facebook recovers, wouldn’t Zuckerberg slowly begin to start selling his shares? Obviously, he couldn’t slowly sell a significant portion of the shares he owns today WITHOUT people noticing. But, what kind of sign would that be if Zuckerberg started to slowly sell his shares behind the euphemism that he’s diversifying? Zuckerberg is the icon behind Facebook and his continued confidence is what keeps many investors afloat. Nothing breathes fear more than the icon of a company selling a significant portion of his shares. It would be a really bad look for Facebook amidst a time where Facebook has PR issues. But, Mark selling his shares will come into fruition. No social media platform is so indispensable that it can’t be replaced by a newer, more innovative and superior product. If Facebook does recover which I strongly believe it will...it will eventually a price for suckers to buy into before crashing for good. That is why you have to be very careful investing in Facebook, understood the risks involved with investing a company that has only one product: social media. It is a precarious stock and buying the dip is not a guaranteed smart move. Good luck to all.

Say someone shorted FB (random numbers) at 200 USD, 100 shares. Totalling 20.000USD.

The share plummets and its not at 170 USD. Totalling 17k.

You pocket 3k as profit and keep the 100shares. Is this right?


Also, on Degiro. The price that you want to short it on, is that the price you put into the limit order (aka 200 USD into the limit order in this case).

Noxiousremedy;1532703577;92d8jr;;5;;1;"Hello, very new to stocks, just wanted to get some general opinions on a few stocks I am looking at and if they are worth investing in for the long term of 5 to 15 years down the road.

GE, so GE is just not doing well but looking at there history they seem like bungie jumpers on value. They are double their last low now, and the tariffs and some bad stuff have them currently down, but its GE which I have always thought of strong enough to last for my grandkids, bu idk, is it worth going into? 

AMTX. This is a USA / india based biofuel company thats brand new. I feel like biofuel is a crucial future market because electric is always hated upon, and oil is so valuable but essentially is finite. Looking long run, is it something that could survive and flourish?

SXC /SXCP, so this is a essential company for producing steel, US based Coke production, coke is used to create steel. Tariffs I believe bugged out our metals in the US and abroad, trump was in Illinois yesterday saying he would get steel going again. So does America have a chance at making steel and thus using this coke, or will we try to export it? Thoughts on future of steel 

Also, with GE would it be wise to go for smaller products GE uses, like I believe a small cap tech company has its products used in the aviation sector of GE.

Also, with suncoke, are mineral/metal stock companies worth investing in the US market since we may be doing more in house stuff under our current nationalist government, or will that fade and we will just import more?

PinholePhotographer;1532703905;92da9t;;5;;1;"After things happens it becomes obvious but make previsions of what will happen is often hard it seems. But I believe that what makes previsions hard is the euphorically information pollution that becomes distracting.

It could be just pure luck because I start investing 8 months ago only, but two months before the bear in the gold price, I was convinced that the price would fall soon or later and short selling would be the best thing to do. But despite of that I thought it would be better to wait and see, so I day trade instead and lost money. If I had just short selling and waited, I would have made a good buck now.

The same with facebook. It was one month ago I told many times in this sub-Reddit that despite the constant rise of Facebook stock price, it soon or later would fall dramatically because the constant changes it makes in the platform, making it lose subscribers and prove their PR to be wrong. I was convinced that any investment on Facebook would be only wise if short-selling.

Before this two events, I also believed that $Shop would keep growing despite the Chinese competition and  its risky Market Cap. But in the first dip I panic and closed it with a loss. But it kept growing until now and if I have left the money there I would have made good money as well.

The only prevision I made which proved to be wrong was $HUN which I thought would have a slow but constant growth but for reasons more complexes that I could grasp it didn't. 

I don't regret not investing on my previsions because I still prefer to wait and see if it was just luck or it I have a good eye for it. But I regret a lot not have wrote down all the analyses and information that I used for my previsions which I want to start doing.

And what I like the most is to find shot-sell opportunities. And I guess it is because I don't like most companies and corporation. It doesn't matter how much potential of growth McDonald's, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Facebook, etc can have, I would feel very bad morally to put my money in such companies. So I would never do any investment related to such companies unless I find a short sell opportunity, which makes me feel morally much pleased.";253759;Are you good at make prevision but are too afraid to put money on it?;

A few preliminary observations:

*  The value of US currency and gold are inversely correlated.  The trade weighted value of the USD is quite high right now. This would lead me to think that this (generally) would be a good time to purchase mining stock?
* It costs  ≈800-1,000 usd to extract an oz of gold currently valued @ $1,200. Makes me question long term profitability with gold futures falling right now and extracting costs increasing?
* Looking at 08' as a case study for a recession, I am also questioning the stability of mining stocks. ABX, GG, and NEM (large gold mining companies) took pretty hard hits ≈50%. I know everything is relative and they maybe did better than other stocks. Regardless, I would think that gold mining would be a pretty safe investment in the face of a crash.

The second-quarter results were the first sign that a new European privacy law and a succession of privacy scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and other app developers have bit into Facebook’s business. The company further warned that the toll would not be offset by revenue growth from emerging markets and Facebook’s Instagram app, which has been more immune from privacy concerns.

Facebook’s fortunes shifted in under two hours as the company first reported revenue and user growth that missed expectations and then issued warnings about future growth and expenses.

Operating profit margin, which fell to 44 percent in the second quarter from 47 percent a year ago, will sink to the “mid-30s” for more than two years,

someonerezcody;1532756709;92jvj7;;6;;0;"My theory:
Given the decline we are seeing in FANG stocks, I think the value of user data for the purposes of targeted adverting isn't yielding what it once did, and a lot of these FANG companies deal largely in ad targeting / user data (significantly, Facebook and Twitter). I've speculated for some time now that companies are going lower budget on advertising, which could be a signal that people are not spending as much as they once did (i.e. ""less effective advertising"" ).It wasn't long ago that the market caught on to the idea that gathering large amounts of data could be used to target/dictate consumer spending, and I think a decline in this sector indicates the market is beginning to realize it has overreached. The effectiveness of ad targeting from user data is clearly seen in the unprecedented rise of the FANG stocks over the years....in fact, I think it has been so effective that the average consumer is now unable to spend or use credit like they once could before they had been targeted with ads.

Google struck gold on a search engine, but maybe the mine has officially run out of ore. If people can't afford the products/services offered through advertisements, they simply can't buy the product. The ads would be deemed less effective, and companies would be inclined to spend less on it. The FANG execs would see the writing on the wall when their earnings have declined......That could be quite the incentive to dump stock before the quarter ends. Just saying.

Would you call it an advertising bubble?

Here's my thoughts on the matter.
Tesla shares have taken a hit this month but I feel this is more to do with the bad PR Elon has got from Twitter and I would think it should recover most of these losses quickly. I'm  looking to invest longish term (1-2 years) and I feel they are going to take a big share of the market in Europe in the next few years as most European car manufacturers have not invested heavily in electric cars. Also the fact that most governments are looking to incentivise going electric in the future it will make running costs cheaper relative to diesel/petrol. The model 3 car itself is priced so it is within the price range of most middle earning households and it outperforms ICE cars in terms of torque, 0-60mph and it has a ton of features most cars at that price don't have. Also the demand at the moment far outstrips supply which is  encouraging even though they have had alot of bad PR this year with missed deadlines and empty promises about production output.
That all being said I am still looking to invest in a loss making company, one that has been loss making since it's first year. I've been discussing this with a few friends and they told me to be cautious as the reason the stock is valued as highly as it is even with the fact they are losing money is because all my points listed above have already been priced in, and even if tesla starts to take a large share of the market from bmw/audi/Mazda etc the stock might not go up the way I hope it will. 
I'm pretty new to this investment game so sorry if I've made some glaring oversight on something important.

Following the big ones, Buffett said it, I'm periodically investing in Vanguarg VUSD (the USA VOO). The other night, a friend of mine was saying that putting money in the bank, in some savings books, would have obtained a higher percentage of earnings than any financial index or ETF. Now, I know it is not true and the VUSD that follows the trend of the S&amp;P, in the last 10 years (of course), has grown more and more. I wanted to bring some numbers to my friend to be able to support the idea that the ETF has a greater gain than the bank, but I could not. I realized that I am not able to calculate possible gains from an instrument like the ETF. 


Question:


Suppose I want to put 10,000 euros in the ETF (VUSD UCITS) and retire them in 20 years: how much would I earn?

WinningOrLearning;1532865080;92u8d7;;0;;2;"Hi all,
Let’s say stock ABC has a volatility percentage of  4-5% a day. That means it’s price moves up or down four or five percent per day.

When using metrics like ATR(average true range) and volatility do you measure percentage up or percentage down as I’ve found they are two different numbers. A stock going from 40 to 50 dollars goes up 25% while going down from 50 to 40 is 20%. 

So my conclusion is on up days you use the higher percentage range the 5% as the top range and on down days you use 4% as the bottom of its range. Is this correct?

thekhalasar;1532887646;92wozh;;9;;0;"Movie Pass by HMNY can not possibly survive, unless movie companies want so. What prevents major movie theater companies such as AMC from buying their employees a subscription to Movie Pass and pay them to go see X number of movies at an AMC theater. This can result in massive revenue to AMC theaters at a huge loss to Movie Pass as they will be paying for all of those tickets with borrowed money and only receiving $10 per such a subscriber. Does that make sense? Essentially, AMC can make an unlimited amount of money from HMNY.

My theory is that Movie Pass was actually created by movie companies in conjunction with Helios and Matheson (HMNY) to boost ticket sales and  bring back the dying interest of going to the movie theaters. Now that millions of people are once again talking about movie theaters and Movie Pass, they can transition all of these users into their own subscription plans and remove Movie Pass from the picture. Unless things change with Movie Pass in the near future, it will either have to be acquired or declare bankruptcy, meanwhile subscribers will have to scramble to find a similar service now provided by movie theater companies.

King-JC;1532905530;92ywif;Advice;4;;1;"Hi all, the company I work for offer a share scheme in which a monthly contribution is taken from the employees salary over a 3 year period. When the scheme matures, the total contributions are used to purchase shares at an option price agreed at the beginning of the scheme. Employees can cash out at any time and receive their full contributions back, however, you can only purchase the shares if they see the scheme to its end.

My colleague needs capital for personal reasons and is considering cashing out of his scheme 6 months before maturity. He has been paying £50 a month for the past 2.5 years to a total contribution of £1500 so far. Hes offering me to buy him out of his scheme which would mean me paying him the £1500 plus £50 a month for the next 6 months. at the end of which he would sign over the shares into my name. 

How do i go about the transfer process? As far as I've gathered from the HMRC website, to do this I would be required to complete a stock transfer form plus send 0.5% stamp duty fee on the total value of the shares. is this something i do, or he does/ do i need him to send the certicate with the form to the HMRC to get in my name, or does he send that to companies house, or to our employers company secretary?

Im completely ignorant on how any of this works having never bought shares before and was wondering if anyone could give me advice on how exactly to do this. The shares are in a UK limited company, I'm unsure if they are certified or nominee or even if that matters.. if you need any more infomation to provide more detailed advice please feel free to ask. 

Thank you in advance :)

Note: I understand I would be placing a lot of trust in my colleague as essentially i would be giving him the money without anything going into my name until he receives the shares upon maturity of the scheme.

EquityTom;1532922698;930tb1;;1;;2;"Caterpillar Inc. earnings is due to report tomorrow, Monday July 30 2018 before the bell. 

[I mapped out a few important levels on the chart](https://image.ibb.co/bw6dPT/cat.png). You may use it for Day Trading or short/long term investing. Make sure you wait for setup at or near these levels before taking a trade.

CAT had a great 2017 rally from 90.34 to 158.65 (Double in a year). It topped out 173 at the beginning Jan 2018. From Feb to June it has been trading between 140 - 165 and then broke lower, and found temporary support 132.50 and rally back withing the Feb to June range and closed 142.56 last Friday.

While the pull back from the 2018 high was shallow, there are no tracking and it doesn't have enough gas to take it higher. According to Earnings Whisper 66% is expected to beat earnings. While many look for a gap higher tomorrow, the resistance could be 159-160 and bears would be there to defend their ground. 

For a investment point of view, I preferred the stock to gap lower and trade down to near 125. When that happens, I would be a short term buyer and ride the trend as long as I can before it stop me out.

Christian0506;1532923323;930vmz;;14;;2;"Since Chinese law doesn’t allow foreign entities to own controlling stakes in Chinese internet companies, any Chinese company trading on, for example, the NYSE has to set up a shell corporation outside of China with a contract entitling it to the profits of the original company back in China. These are the shares you buy in the US.  This is the case for companies like Alibaba and Baidu.

This is a legal grey area in China and so the whether or not the contract holds up in Chinese court is up to the Chinese government.

arnabds;1532952850;933jqi;Ticker News;0;;1;" Earnings Season is one of the most important time for the investors as the public companies report their quarterly earnings. There is generally a lot of volatility in the shares during this period.  According to reports, earnings growth is up by 22.4% &amp; revenues are up 8.6% for this quarter.  


As we move forward to the second half of the earnings quarter, there is still positivity among investors despite major stocks missed earnings. Most of the [Banking](https://www.agrud.com/analytics/us-equities/banks-mtd-worst-performers) and [Tech](https://www.agrud.com/analytics/us-equities/nasdaq-worst-monthly-performers) stocks already reported their quarterly earnings and many among these failed to meet the analyst's expectations. In the last week, all the gains were washed out by the disappointing earnings reported by the tech stocks and the bank stocks. The [DOW](https://www.agrud.com/analytics/us-equities/dow-30-stocks) index closed the week on a downside of -0.30% followed by [S&amp;P 500](https://www.agrud.com/analytics/us-equities/sp500-worst-daily-performers) and NASDAQ down by -0.66% and -1.46% respectively.  


Earnings Report:

[Netflix](https://www.agrud.com/markets/nasdaq-nflx/snapshots) met the analysts' estimates but failed to meet the investor's expectations. They failed in meeting the target number of subscribers for this quarter. [Amazon](https://www.agrud.com/markets/nasdaq-amzn/snapshots), another [FAANG](https://www.agrud.com/analytics/us-equities/faang-stocks) component stock, failed to meet the revenue but doubled up on the EPS reporting $5.07 on the consensus EPS of $2.50.  


The recent tax cuts have also helped add a small percentage in the earnings gain. The trade war issues slowly faded away and not all the sectors were largely affected by it. The [Automobiles](https://www.agrud.com/analytics/us-equities/automobiles-mtd-worst-performers) sector and the [Materials](https://www.agrud.com/analytics/us-equities/large-cap-worst-monthly-performers-materials) sector were the most affected by the increase in Steel and Aluminium prices. On the other hand, the recent tax cuts have helped all the sectors, industries, and companies save a little amount of money and reap the benefits.  


In this week and the upcoming weeks, there are many other major stocks that are still expected to report earnings. The [Information Technology](https://www.agrud.com/analytics/us-equities/large-cap-worst-weekly-performers-information-technology) sector might make a comeback after a bad show as there are still some major tech stocks that are expected to report earnings for the quarter.

TomChen55;1532955287;933tg5;;2;;3;"The hedge funds held massive long positions in Facebook based on first-quarter regulatory filings. This was in contrast to the mutual funds, which have reportedly been trimming their positions in so-called FANG stocks since late 2016, the Goldman report said on Thursday.

Last Thursday’s “gap and go” sell-off in Facebook was ugly for long investors but it should only serve as a reminder of what could happen to any stock at any time, not just this social media giant. Furthermore, it should not be used as an indicator “of things to come” for the FANG stocks or the entire technology sector.

Sure, it could happen in other technology stocks because investors are loaded up on the long side in these stocks because for years, they have been the best game in town. So far this year, the tech-based NASDAQ Composite is up 12.1%, while the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is up 5.4% and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a 3.0% gain.

Every time a revenue and earnings report is posted, investors run the risk that a company will miss on both sides, triggering a mass exit from the stock on profit-taking. Yes, profit-taking, not fresh short selling. That’s why savvy investors diversify their holdings.

Investors in a bull market are constantly looking for value. Some see higher prices in the future and decide to buy now in anticipation of higher prices. Some play for value and prefer to buy dips. With Facebook, investors perceived the stock as overvalued based on future growth projections so they took a little off the top.

The size of the sell-off was obviously a headlines grabber, but you have to look at who was behind the selling. It wasn’t mom and pop investors, nor was it all mutual fund sellers. They may have booked profits when the bad news came out, but the majority of the selling took place during the over hours market and it was primarily dominated by the over-weighted hedge funds.

According to a recent survey by Goldman Sachs, more than 10 percent of hedge funds counted Facebook as a top 10 holding.

The hedge funds were in massive long positions based on first-quarter regulatory filings. This was in contrast to the mutual funds, which have reportedly been trimming their positions in so-called FANG stocks since late 2016, the Goldman report said on Thursday.

In other words, the mutual funds were hit less-hard from the Facebook debacle than the highly speculative hedge funds.

Contagion Effect?
Firstly, let’s look at the weightings of the FAANG stocks – Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (Alphabet) – in the NASDAQ Composite Index. Facebook is weighted 4.983 percent, Amazon 10.475 percent, Apple is 11.151 percent, Netflix is 1.834 percent and Google (Alphabet) is 5.134 percent.

It may be top-weighted in Amazon and Apple, but the others seem to be fine. A sell-off equal to Facebook’s move will, therefore, have a greater effect on the index then Thursday’s move in the social media giant. So the 1.06% loss in the index last week was relatively small when compared to, for example, the steep break in February.

Secondly, analysts are now saying that Amazon is beginning to decouple from the FAANGs. Remember that Amazon released earnings the day after Facebook. Although they were mixed, the stock still rose so there goes the contagion argument.

It looks like the contagion argument may be valid for Facebook and Twitter since both sold off sharply last week and they are both social media companies. However, given the history of the social media sub-sector (see AOL and Myspace), this can be a volatile group of stocks. It is truly an “only the strong survive” industry.

In conclusion, I have to say that based on the second-quarter earnings results, the technology sector is fine and should before well the rest of the year even with the “blip” on the chart from Facebook. As of Friday, earnings from more than half of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index have reported, and so far 88% beat on earnings while 74% had better-than-expected revenue. Furthermore, technology stocks continue to look good, with 35 of 36 companies beating on the bottom line.

So when it comes to assessing the value of an entire sector, try not to get caught up in the headlines about how money was lost, and the historical size of the crash, keep an eye on the entire sector. Furthermore, if money leaves Facebook, a social media company, it may flow into other stocks in the sector including Microsoft, Apple, Netflix or Amazon.";254764;Social-Media Giant Facebook No Concern for True Technology Investors;

It’s long been a financial market truism that if everyone already owns a particular stock, bond or security, there’s no one left to buy and the only way for the price to go is down.

That’s easy to assert, less easy to measure.

But a long-running and widely followed monthly survey of global investors by Bank of America Merrill Lynch has recently gained a reputation for accurately spotting where the herd is nearing a cliff edge.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s fund manager survey polls several asset managers every month on various investment trends. Among the questions participants answer is what they consider to be the ‘most crowded trade’ in world markets.

Since the end of last year, the “most-crowded” trades featured in the survey have all unravelled in a short space of time following the poll’s publication.

In January, the most-crowded trade highlighted in the survey published on Jan. 16 was shorting, or selling volatility, which had sunk to historically low levels.

Soon after, higher than expected wage growth numbers in the United States prompted a big selloff in stocks and the VIX index .VIX, also known as Wall Street’s “fear-gauge”, posted its biggest one-day spike ever recorded. The VIX is a common proxy for expected stock market volatility.

The spike in the VIX caused major losses at exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or exchange-traded notes (ETNs), which bet on volatility remaining low. Some were forced to shut down.

For February, March and April, the most-crowded trade has been “Long FAANG + BAT”, a reference to buying and holding the FAANG (Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix, and Google’s Alphabet) and BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent) groups of technology heavyweight stocks in the United States and China.

So when could that trade pop?

Manish Kabra, head of European equity and quant strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said it is not unusual for a particular asset class to spend months as a “crowded trade” on the survey.

“Sometimes it takes a bit of patience ... for what people say are crowded trades to become a contrarian trade. Historically we have seen, for instance, for almost six months people could say the same trades were crowded.”

Kabra noted three instances in the past where there was a strong view to short emerging markets - those calls were followed by the start of a bull market in emerging markets in 2016.

There hasn’t been a heavy shakeout in tech stocks yet but they have been rattled in recent weeks over a range of issues, especially increased regulatory scrutiny and the prospect of being caught up in a trade tussle between Washington and Beijing.

The survey shows funds have been overweight technology stocks for over a decade, raising questions about whether the sector is set to suffer the same fate as Bitcoin and short-vol products.

In the latest poll, 64 percent of investors said they would move to underweight on the sector if anti-trust, tax and privacy regulations ratcheted up.

So if soaring tech stocks are not next in line for a reversal, what could be? The most recent survey indicates the second most-crowded trade has been growing in conviction: shorting the U.S. dollar. Shorting the dollar has been the second most-crowded trade in the survey since February this year.";254930;"The concept of the ""most crowded trade""";

captaintadpole;1532987712;938gle;;11;;2;"When a company's share price is too high, often they will do a stock split to lower the price and make buying the stock more affordable. Issuing double the stock will cut the price in half because the demand stayed the same but the supply doubled. 

So, stock valuation is dependent on the number of shares in circulation. What I don't understand is when people try to compare the prices of two companies saying things like ""oh XYZ stock is above $300, so therefore ABC, a similar company trading at only $250, is undervalued."" 

Wouldn't you have to know the exact number of shares in circulation to accurately compare valuations like that? And when people say ""XYZ is easily a $400 dollar per share company."" No, it depends on the number of shares in circulation. You can't just arbitrarily pick a number. 

If my observation is correct then it makes no sense whatsoever to compare stock valuations of different companies based on stock price alone. Am I right about this? Thanks. ";254956;Question about stock valuation;

Something like this: https://dqydj.com/stock-return-calculator-dividend-reinvestment-drip/

The above website seems to be dead and doesn't update past 3/27/18, but something like this is very helpful when researching growth of a stock that pays high dividends.  Looking at a company like GE for example, it seems like its down 40ish percent over a time period, but taking into account dividend reinvestment, its only down 30 percent.  Something like that.  https://www.dividendchannel.com/drip-returns-calculator/  this is an example of what I would want, but I manually checked it, and it seems to be off slightly everytime";255226;Investment Return Calculator With DRIP;

cherkashine;1533056201;93g7zp;;20;;0;Me and my friend can save up 1000$ and I think that stocks are pretty cool, but can I make money from it? Is 1000$ enough to make reasonable money in day trading?
