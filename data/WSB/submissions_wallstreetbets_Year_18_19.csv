I've included a new tab based off a screener for individual equities using different filters. 

What I look for is really:

Decent P/E

Debt to equity ratio of &lt;=175%

ROE &gt;=10%

ROA &gt;=10% (looking for stocks that don't require debt leverage for ROA)

Positive P/E estimate for 2018

Net profit margin &gt;=5%

Then sort from there.

Here are the column descriptions:

Symbol - duh

Company	- duh

Sector	-duh 

D/E	- Debt to Equity (expressed as % so 175% = 1.75/1)

NPM	- Net Profit Margin

Est. EPS Growth	 - estimated EPS growth from 2017 to 2018 estimate

Rev Growth - revenue growth from prior TTM to this TTM	

P/E - current Price to Earnings

P/E Est 2018 - estimated P/E

P/C - Price to Cash Flow (default sorted)

P/B	- Price to Book

ROE	- Return on Equity

ROA	- Return on  Assets

Distance from PT - Distance from price target per Merrill Lynch (who I like the most). A positive numbers means it is X% **under** the target (so a $9 stock with a $10 PT would be 10%). A negative number means it is X% over the target.

BofA Merrill Lynch rating (low is good)

CFRA rating (high is good)

Morningstar (high is good)

The long and short of it is, Intel is introducing a drastic security measure into their chips through a patch.  It is called KASLR.  This is effective; but at a cost.  A 30-40% performance cost.  Almost all large data/cloud providers (Amazon, Google, etc.) use Intel chips.  

People suspect this is because it's *rumored* a bug exists in the Intel CPUs that allow code to be run across multiple virtual machines on the same host.  A HUGE security vulnerability.  Think, Joe the hacker opening an AWS account and accessing all data on that machine (or even network) completely unrestricted.

I would expect AMD to move upwards heavily on this rumor.

I mean, no sane company would halve the performance of their product without GREAT reason.  And AMD is not doing this.

As you can see this has been quite the ride from $2.5 and I do not believe we are done yet. We just set a record on a daily consumption (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-02/america-is-burning-more-gas-than-ever-as-chill-grips-east-chart) and the weather forcast looks like we will remain cold for at least another 10 days. So what does that mean? When comparing storage levels (currently at 3,318) with past years levels and comparing this weeks and next weeks demand I estimate a draw of 250-400 this week and 200-350 next week putting us at around 2014 levels that supported a price range of ~$4.50-$6. Do I actually believe we will get anywhere near $6? no but I think hovering around $4 is a real possibility in the next 30 days and you should to.

Confirmed homosexual firm, $INTC, will be announcing [a massive in-hardware security bug in its modern processors that will require a **-30% performance penalty** to hotfix it](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7nl8r0/intel_bug_incoming/). This will notably affect large datacenter customers such as $GOOG and $AMZN (short them for maximum tendies). 

* As an in-hardware bug, this is not easy to fix and will require a brutal hotfix as a temporary measure. A less destructive fix will not be available until the hardware is replaced with updated models in the coming years (as if customers would choose to buy more $INTC products after this!). 

* The bug is currently under embargo much like $INTC is still officially in the closet. In the coming days, $INTC will publicly acknowledge its sexual orientation and the existence of this bug. 

* [$INTC's CEO sold off $11M of $INTC stock less than two weeks ago](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/19/intels-ceo-just-sold-a-lot-of-stock.aspx) and now holds the bare minimum number of shares required by the CEO according to $INTC by-laws. Looks like he's getting his yacht while he still can! 

* Competing processors made by SuBae are confirmed to not be affected by this vulnerability as their architecture is much girthier. 

This leaves **SuBae poised to fuck the competition up the ass** on large datacenter contracts. 

* $AMD has recently [ramped up production on their 32-core ""EPYC"" CPU](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12032/amd-announces-wider-epyc-availability-and-rocm-17-with-tensorflow-support) that competes in the datacenter market. 

* Not only does the 32C EPYC have more cores than $INTC's flaccid 28C CPU, but [EPYC costs half as much](https://www.anandtech.com/show/11544/intel-skylake-ep-vs-amd-epyc-7000-cpu-battle-of-the-decade/10). 

* SuBae is rumored to release an [EPYC 2.0 with an even more turgid 64-core CPU as early as 2019](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-epyc-2-64-cores-128-threads-and-256mb-l3-cache). 

 * Impotent traitor, [Raja Kodorki, is confirmed to not be involved with Epyc in any way](http://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-boss-raja-koduri-joins-intel-to-work-on-integrated-and-discrete-graphics/) and will only be adding performance issues to $INTC products going forward. 

* SuBae won't rest until EPYC is packed deep into datacenters everywhere, leaving $INTC frustrated and on the streets to beg for tendies.

SeekingTheta;1514950166;7nrwi7;Technicals;52;;72;"Part 1:

Since WSB has turned into a Micron-only subreddit, I suggest you read up and understand the technology of what you are investing in. 

As you know, Micron makes DRAM or Dynamic Access Random Memory. The other type of high-speed memory used today, is SRAM (static RAM),  random access memory (RAM) that retains data bits in its memory as long as power is being supplied. Unlike dynamic RAM (DRAM), which stores bits in cells consisting of a vertical capacitor and a transistor, SRAM does not have to be periodically refreshed. However, to retain the bit of information, the SRAM bit-cell needs positive feedback to reinforce the charge / voltage between two nodes. This is the circuit diagram for 1 bit SRAM: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/SRAM_Cell_%286_Transistors%29.svg/400px-SRAM_Cell_%286_Transistors%29.svg.png

Note that it takes 6 transistors to hold 1 bit of information. The DRAM on the other hand only needs 1 transistor and a small capacitor, so effectively the area footprint (per bit) is 6x lower. The first DRAM actually used 10um node and 3 transistor logic per bit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_1103. The DRAM that we use today are 1T: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/306002/why-does-a-dram-cell-necessarily-contain-a-capacitor
The information of a DRAM cell is simply stored as a charge (say a couple electrons in a small femtoFarad capacitor made vertically in the substrate). A ""1"" signal is ""set"" by storing charge from a pass-gate (transistor) and reading is ""read"" by opening this pass-gate again onto another bitline-capacitor (shared by all the DRAM bit cells in a single row or column). This charge in the bitline is digitized and deemed either a ""1"" if the charge (read as a voltage) crosses a certain threshold or ""0"" else. As retention of charge is a huge issue and coupling between neighboring DRAM cells is a growing concern, scaling of DRAM has become a major problem unlike SRAM which is designed with conventional digital CMOS. Lots of fabrication techniques and IP have and are continuing to address DRAM-specific optimizations and as such this means that DRAM development has diverged from the conventional digital design process, which means that only Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix and Nanya have fabs that are designed and optimized for DRAM development whereas TSMC, Intel cannot. 

Why use DRAM over SRAM? While we can see SRAM in registers to L2 cache in SMs in GPUs and register files to L2 cache in CPUs, the area (in um^2) can quickly blow up by increasing the number of bits. And silicon real estate is expensive. Well why do we use SRAM anyway? Because SRAM is on-chip next to the computing logic, it is also a lot faster and more energy-efficient than a DRAM read/write access off-chip. To give you some idea, the majority of the CPU area footprint is the SRAMs scattered all over the die. But the total cache size is ~MByte range. Compare this with a 1GB DRAM that can store 5000 256x256 images @8-bit precision (1GB / (256^2 * 8 bits * 3 RGB)), while stashing the image onto your cpu's cache can maybe hold a couple. With high-throughput and parallel workloads such as deep learning, optimization, gaming, video encoding, crypto-mining (hashing), etc, we are starting to see that hardware is quickly becoming memory and IO bound rather than compute-bound. For example, deep learning kernels are almost always designed to be IO bound. Please read the TPU paper: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilhMie67rYAhVTImMKHTHHAXcQFggpMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1704.04760&amp;usg=AOvVaw00srXJTsZI5Jf3Z14zY3QJ

TLDR:
EDIT:
What I am trying to say is that in our world of big data and IoT and AI and blockchain, high-speed + high-throughput memory is key. For that reason, DRAM is a quintessential ingredient in next-generation computing systems and fabrics and will continue to play a pivotal role from data-centers to automotive to drones to GPUs, Alexa devices, smartphones, FPGAs (with Micron's HMCs), etc. It will be EVERYWHERE. We do not live in a compute-bound world anymore; we live in a communication/memory-bound one. 

EDIT2:
To clear up some confusion, high-throughput computing requires both DRAM (high throughput, high memory size in bits) and SRAM (low memory size in bits but high-speed (right next to compute)). They are both needed and play important heterogeneous roles in the memory hierarchy: see the architecture of a GPU, TPU, FPGA, CPU-w/ system memory.";;Why Dynamic Access Random Memory and why Micron?;

Please also describe the good qualities you honestly believe Martin has and explain how you personally came to know of these qualities.  Include as much detail about your experiences with Martin as possible. Your letter must be candid and truthful. 
* It is important that your letter not address certain issues.  Thus, you may include a plea for mercy or leniency. However, it would not be appropriate to ask Judge Matsumoto to dismiss the charges and please avoid voicing any opinions you may have about the “unfairness” of the criminal justice system, why you do not think Martin did anything wrong, opinions about Martin’s innocence, etc. Nor should you attempt to minimize the seriousness of the crime or seek to blame anyone else.  Your letter should focus on Martin’s character, NOT Martin’s recent revocation of bail and remand into federal custody.
* While you may plead with the court to impose the most lenient sentence the court considers appropriate you should not advocate that the court impose a specific sentence. 
* Please do not post these instructions on any social media outlets.  Instead, if you know someone who may want to write a letter of support for Martin, please instruct that person to contact our office.
 If you have any questions about this process please feel free to contact me, or Teny Geragos of Brafman &amp; Associates at (212) 750-7800 or via email at azellan@braflaw.com and tgeragos@braflaw.com.

Conventional wisdom is always that gun stocks do well under democratic administrations because of increased sales. Sales increase because people are afraid of &gt;muh second amendment being taken away.

You can see how much gun companies have suffered since trump got elected, because their is no pressure to run out and buy guns.

Cats_n_Porn;1515171461;7oci1f;;54;;42;"On Tuesday I saw the news about Intel here on Reddit and it seemed obvious to me that this was a big deal. The stock was up and I bought about $500 of puts. I'm new to options so I didn't want to risk much and I sold pretty early on Wednesday morning for 130% gain. Could have made a lot more if I had waited a few hours, but that's not the point. This was one of my first options plays and I was very happy with myself and it got me wondering how often do such easy opportunities come along and how do you find them?

It was obvious to me that the Intel news was a big deal and the markets hadn't reacted yet. An up to 30% performance drop in all the huge data centers was going to cause a big red day for Intel. I was confident about my trade, but being an amateur I was not confident enough to risk a lot of money. Now, though, I have a thirst for more. Unfortunately I bought more INTC puts yesterday because of this, and I think I let my moneylust blind me because they are not looking good. I might get lucky next week, but I'm afraid INTC may have bottomed out for now. 

I don't really know where INTC is going from here, so I'm probably done playing with them for now. I want to know where to start looking for my next play though. I'm afraid this opportunity was so rare that I'm going to have blueballs looking for another. Should I just go to the casino?

bobson444;1515212562;7oh0tu;;37;;33;"Hey guys, I'm here to drop some truths that will make us all thousandaires. Are you ready? I tried to make it as simple as possible, but it will help if you have a basic understanding of advanced cosmology/geology as well as at least a fifth grade understanding of thermal encabulation chambers. And without further adieu, here it is:

For all since recorded history, the ancients have praised the sun in many different ways. For example, the aztecs made sacrifices to the sun gods. The aztecs were smart people. They had a lot of gold. So clearly they were on to something. Also, the Egyptians had a god named Ra who was super powerful and was the god of the sun. The Egyptians were also pretty smart and there's an 80% chance they were friends with aliens, and the aliens probably told them to worship the sun in exchange for building the pyramids.

See a pattern? It all goes back to the sun. The sun, being the biggest planet, attracts all of the other planets because opposite charges attract (if this doesn't make sense to some of you fags, then please start paying attention in science class instead of staring at your phone at semiconductor stocks). The sun also does another crazy thing. It makes light. Light is the opposite of darkness which happens at night. Light happens during the day, which is when people go to work. And that is when people get paid. 

Read those last two sentences again. Because we have light, people work, and get paid, and get money. This is where my solid investment advice comes in: in order to get money, we have to invest in the SUN! That's where the money comes from! But how do we invest in the sun??

The sun goes by the nickname sol, which is pronounced šœl. Don't worry if you don't understand this, I met linguistics professor once and absorbed some of his knowledge in order to understand this. Also, not many people know this much about the sun, but I know it because I studied the Wikipedia article on the sun as part of my research for making this post. Other research included staring at the sun for 3 minutes (don't worry I wore my glasses).

I digress. What's important is that the sun is named sol. After some linguistic analysis, I realized that it is important to find words that start with sol. And what starts with sol? Solar!!! Which is actually a crazy coincidence, because the sun and solar energy are totally unrelated things. But the sun is the source of all money, and my linguistic analysis points towards ""solar"", so logically we must invest in the technology that was named after the sun. 

I will try to explain why you should invest in solar from a more technological standpoints. Solar panels use thermal encabulation chambers to ionize ambivertatious girdle fluid, which then corrodes the oscillating flanger to produce a mitosis effect which produces electricity (because opposites attract). While it is a fairly simple process, a lot of people don't realize the value here. For example, if the ancient Aztecs were alive and were able to see solar panels, they would invest all of their gold and maybe even some of their sheep. So why wouldn't you?

Also, let's do a little bit of politics. I don't know what you guys all think about our boy trump up in the whitehouse, but he's got a decision to make by January 26th. He's gotta say YES or NO to tariffs from solar panels. And if he says YES, solar might be screwed in America for a while. But if he says NO (and I know he will) then we will all be able to enjoy our tendies and go past the moon all the way to the sun. Why do I think he'll say no to tariffs? Because he's a cultured man with a wise mind, and anyone who's cultured would know how much the aztecs worshipped the sun, and trump will do the favor of honoring their wishes (while also maybe pocketing some of their gold).

So, that about wraps it up. We got a historical reason, a linguistic reason, a technological reason, and a political reason for why solar is the best place to put your money. The best stock to pick in this industry is the one named after the sun. Buy SUNPOWER and ride with me to the sun!

tl;dr aztecs worship the sun, aliens told Egyptians to worship the sun, the sun makes money, the sun is called sol, invest in solar, trump is a wise man, opposites attract, so buy SUNPOWER";;Use the sun for PROFIT;

Celgene has solid fundamentals and has been trading around the $100-$105 level since approximately mid October; which is down from the $130-$140 range it was trading at during that time. During this conference, they will be pre releasing earnings and guidance, which if even remotely positive, I believe will boost the stock in a positive fashion. In addition, Celgene is coming into support and has held its current levels very well. Subsequently, I took on a very small position ($1k) and am holding some of next week's 108 calls and some of the regular January expiry 107 calls. Logic may seem confusing, but shake and bake baby. Let me know what you jabronis think and if you are going to hop on the Celgene train for some quick and easy tendies.

[Loan](https://imgur.com/a/MX8H1)

I started trading in February of last year. My initial investment was building with regular deposits and got up to $36,954 by December.

After the great tech crash (late nov early dec), my initial investment went down to $20,429 (45% loss). I was invested with something like 4x margin in all tech. Before the crash, my portfolio was worth $56,566 (65% return).

In a depressed drunken stupor, I decided to apply for a personal loan and either get my money back or go down in a glorious ball of flames.

So far I have made back my initial investment in the first trading week of 2018 + 9k. I plan to pay back the loan in full Feb 2, 2018 for a total cost of ~$2k interest. 

Holdings during this period: SQ, SHOP, NVDA, YUMC, AMD, STZ (loss)

&gt;The iPhone has made Apple Inc. AAPL -0.07% and Wall Street hundreds of billions of dollars. Now some big shareholders are asking at what cost, in an unusual campaign to make the company more socially responsible.

&gt;A leading activist investor and a pension fund are saying the smartphone maker needs to respond to what some see as a growing public-health crisis of youth phone addiction.

&gt;Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, or Calstrs, which control about $2 billion of Apple shares, sent a letter to Apple on Saturday urging it to develop new software tools that would help parents control and limit phone use more easily and to study the impact of overuse on mental health.

&gt;Some have raised concerns about increased rates in teen depression and suicide and worry that phones are replacing old-fashioned human interaction. It is part of a broader re-evaluation of the effects on society of technology companies such as Google and Amazon.com Inc. and social-media companies like Facebook Inc. and Snap chat owner Snap Inc., which are facing questions about their reach into everyday life.";;Tech is going to be the Big Tobacco of our time, short $AAPL;

https://www.tradingview.com/x/xwXQ3ogb/

A rally to the upside going into earnings, possibly suggests that people are bullish on the earnings outcome.

Looking at how FB reacts to earnings generally you have about a 5 to 20pt swing around 30 days out before earnings. 

So the outcomes:

1) Assuming you are still bullish on FB and nothing bad happens, There is a good chance that it will play in the range of 188 to 200. 

How to play this:

1) If you're a trader- You can go all in and buy now at $188, with a reasonable expectation for gain to around 192 to 195. Your stop loss should be set to something equivalent to this.

2) As a trader - You can spread your bets, it'll be less gain, but less risk. Put a portion of your trade in at $188 and prepare to buy back in on a dip if it hits 183 to 179 range. Assuming FB is still bullish there is a good chance it will continue to climb.  If trading this, you're recommended to hold for at least 3 months and to have a stop loss in place. Your expected gain after 3 months should be between 195 and 200, so set your stop loss accordingly. 

3) Long term believer - you can just hold and prepare to continue buying at each subsequent level.

If you're looking for a sell off (whether it be bearish or just looking for a swing) 

1) Start planning your shorts from 188 to 200. with this, you need to have a stop loss in place.

Option plays  3months out - 

Bullish: Reasonable price 200 to 210 expectation.

1) If you're bullish, I'd consider buying a NTM call spread or ATM $5 or $10 wide spread. I'd think that 195/ 200 call spread is your best bang for your buck. @ 1.5 to 1.75 your return is around 200% if it hits the 200 to 210 price expectation.  If you want to just do a long call without the spread, you should consider waiting to buy just after earnings (assuming it doesn't rally), this way the prices should be cheaper. 

2) if you're bearish, just follow the opposite. 

In the end you can always build off of this, this is just an idea of what you should consider.

Good luck

After decreased guidance due to Amazon (one of their biggest customers) decreasing demand on their 40G fiber, it has been free falling since August from $100 to currently $38,37.

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aaoi

I have been doing the dirty job for you to catch and baghold this POS at $60, $50, $40 and $38. It finally seems to have consolidated with a support a bit above $37. Also for the past week volume has been very low compared to average and according to finviz it has a short float of 60%. So on good news this should burst.

The risk is that they were too dependent on Amazon, the company fundamentals seems to be solid and undervalued at the moment due to FUD. Current P/E=9, forward P/E=11, P/S=1.9. Since november some insiders like director Alan Moore have started to get back in in bulk. 

Market sector has been flat-downish, other relevant competitors might be $OCLR or $FNSR.

tl;dr: Possible short squeeze (consolidation, low volume, high short float). Still risky, put stop loss in case it breaks support below $37. Long AMD, NVDA, MU";;$AAOI finally ready for a breakout;

DownvoteToKarmaHell;1515516228;7p8axy;;0;;1;"VIX is still sub 10, and has been sub 10 since 1pm on the first trading day of the year (1/2).

Meaning we are on our 6th day in a row of VIX flirting sub 10. In 2017 that happened twice. But if you look at daily data, in 2017 VIX had only a 3 day streak of not ever surpassing 10 twice, one of which ended its streak at 3 days, the other at 4 days. So we are in territory that has never occurred during 2017, even though it was a year with record low vol. Its obviously a gamble, but it feels like a very safe gamble to say go in on volatility in hopes of a spike this week.

With a modest spike up to a measly 11, based on past performance, a gain of at least 5% could be seen, and if you have huge balls and hop in to UVXY you can double that gain.
Obviously it’s no miracle 20% or 50% gainz, but hey maybe Papa Kim Long VIX tests a nuke and gives you some real action.

After you’ve made some tendies, hop in on XIV and wait until we are sub 10, we’ll, then rinse repeat.

TLDR: based on historical patterns in the VIX, now is the time to long volatility.

I have around 200K in my bank account saved up from working for a few years while living in my parent's basement. I was thinking about throwing all that money into a portfolio of dividend stocks that would all pay dividends on a monthly basis. According to my estimates, I should be getting paid around 2K a month. If I put 1K into rent, 800 into expenses, and save the remaining 200 for emergencies, could I just retire right now at the age of 26? Could anything go wrong with this plan?";;Can I retire now if I put my life savings (~200k) into monthly dividend stocks?;

tdmoneybanks;1515535975;7par83;;9;;7;Chipoltle Mexican Grill has been having a really rough time this year and pretty much since their original ecoli outbreak in 2015. In my opinion, they are still trading at a high premium for their industry and are ripe for a comedown. They have a P/E more than double the rest of the industry, slowing sales and growth, and are just now entering a turn around with a new CEO that will make things get worse before they get better as they restructure. Regardless, they lost consumer trust and just had another outbreak in DEC 20th. This outbreak was AFTER they had a terrible Q3 earnings (worst ever for them) which brought the price down from 330 to about ~295. It has now climbed back up to the 320 level but will be hammered again once earning come out Jan 31st. Only issue is the puts are expensive and the volume isnt great, but the IV is below 40%. ;;DD: CMG;

Cramer essentially calling MU management liars. Why would he do this? Look below

Exhibit B:   
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cramer-analysts-forget-sandisk-143735718.html 
Cramer calling current MU CEO Sanjay ""second rate"" back when Sanjay was CEO of Sandisk. Cramer clearly lost money from believing in Sanjay or Sandisk. ALSO - keep in mind Sandisk later sold for 18 billion in 2016. I wanna say the stock recovered to about $78 after being in the low $50s - $60s. Who wants to bet Cramer had already washed his hands of Sandisk and didnt get those sweet tendie gains from the sale.

Most investors have been staying away from NVAX since its crash in late 2016, but 2018 looks like the year where the stock price recovers A LOT. Backed heavily and consistenly by Gates Foundation and lots more upside expected going into Flu Vaccine trial results in February -- almost guarenteed to be positive. Once their flu vaccine comes into market (late 2018-early 2019 most likely, they've heavily hinted that FDA will fasttrack it), it will be the #1  efficacious* compared to competition.

Don't sleep on this WSB  
      EDIT: If you're thinking of buying, I'd reccomend waiting a few days as the spike right now is definitely exaggerated, wait till it dips back down to about 1.50 - 1.60 but I doubt it'll reach much lower than that

&amp;nbsp;

Decided to buy a call yesterday right before the markets closed, thinking that Dave and Busters (PLAY) would have a nice bounce today from people buying the dip after dropping 22% yesterday. Woke up and looked at my phone to see it was up 2 dollars, got real excited, then opened my portfolio to see I was down $150 because I accidentally bought a put instead of a call... I think it's finally time for me to kill myself in all seriousness. This is the sign I've been waiting for.";;Down $150 because I accidentally bought a put instead of a call...;

The speculation is that if FOX doesn’t sign UFC, and UFC moves to another network, that they would go after WWE because they would have so much air time to fill on FS 1 and FS 2, which relies heavily on UFC. There is also speculation that FOX may want to buy WWE, so that they won’t have to worry about escalating television rights and losing them in the future. They were interested in doing this with UFC before the price ballooned. With FOX/Disney deal happening, they are cash rich right now.

Word is that McMahon isn’t interested in selling his majority interest just yet, because the feeling that the stock will soar because they will get a big increase in television rights. If the shares hit $40, Vince could continue to do what he’s doing, and sell small pieces of it off while maintaining full voting control. If there’s a UFC level offer ($3.5 billion or more), most feel McMahon would be inclined to sell.


I went long in options after the price dipped due to the insider sell off and XFL rumors a week or two ago. Holding 20 APR 18 34 C

I made a post on December 28th telling everyone to buy $MJX at $31 for a variety of reasons, but most of all because I knew there would be a lot of hype around it. But in the following days, the underlying stocks ran up way too fast. Because of the combination of fear from the Sessions announcement and the resulting weak volume, I've decided to reduce my position significantly and watch it for a couple weeks.

[The short-term chart looks reliably bearish from a technical perspective](https://imgur.com/TBpDUwO) and I expected the volatility to be a lot more muted than it turned out to be.

Back in 2016 after their first drug called Ocaliva was on the market, 19 people died, but those people were dying either way. PBC is a bitch. Doctors were giving bad doses, people were starting the meds sick as fuck already, and with better education between the company and the doctors, they'd have been fine. I imagine they've learned this. Basically, though, the drug wasn't what killed people. Nonetheless, investors freaked out and in September it dropped 50%. The company is still working on that PBC treatment but also, more importantly, a treatment for NASH. NASH is a currently untreatable liver disease that is common and growing across the globe, affecting 2%- 5% of the USA. 

So if you get in now, it's undervalued and set to go pretty high if their trials go well. This is probably a long to some extent but I believe it could be very good.";;DD: Intercept Pharma $ICPT;

1) Expect a higher than expected guidance for upcoming earnings for Apple and Micron as USDCNY is projected to continue to sink into early 2018 as result of tax cuts and low interest rates with unusually low inflation rates due to the Amazon-effect. 

2)  Expect higher margins in Europe as a result of ECB's fiscal tightening.

3) DRAM prices: The Korean Won strengthened against the USD by 7% this year, slashing memory margins of the top 2 DRAM suppliers: Samsung and SK Hynix. This puts pressure for Samsung and SKH to keep DRAM (and NAND) prices high, which is a good sign for Micron.

4) Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney reiterates a strong buy and PT to 55.

5) Manish Nigam of Credit Suisse says he expects that current ""exceptionally high"" D-RAM chip margins around 60% are sustainable:
https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/01/11/memory-chip-demand-is-on-a-hot-streak.html

5) Apple has seen record growth in Australia and Japan and in app+services (https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/app-store-kicks-off-2018-with-record-breaking-holiday-season/). Recently, analysts think that Apple can write off $4B in tax loophole: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-11/apple-seen-getting-possible-4-billion-boost-from-tax-law-quirk

the_darkmongoose;1515872742;7q6pj0;;14;;15;"I think there are a couple things here that are going to send $GREK, an ETF with a basket of Greek companies, ([my position](https://imgur.com/m3M6zq7)) to the moon.  Timetable: 3-5 years (if you want quicker gainz, you could always try options).

(1) The Greeks almost have their shit together. 
This summer they'll (hopefully) finalize the last stage of their [nut-busting bailout](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-07/greece-s-10-step-road-map-to-a-bailout-program-exit-in-august).  With the [Brexit negotiations](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40788669) taking up most of the limelight this year, the EU might not have the energy/focus to squeeze the Greeks' balls. This could lead to a fairly favorable last stage of the package. Which could lead to tendies for us.

(2) I think that as the Brexit negotiations heat up and as talk increasingly focuses on the nitty-gritty of how the economic shit is actually going to work people will start to get scared and the Euro and Pound will weaken against the dollar. A favorable exchange rate will make Greek goods like [baklava](https://diethood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Coconut-Baklava-1-WP.jpg) more attractive, give their net exports a boost, strengthen their economy, and give us tendies. 

This is not the prevailing opinion. The ECB is [already winding down](https://www.ft.com/content/c276288e-f6d5-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00) their QE and ""hints"" that their tightening will be quicker than [expected](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/12/the-euro-is-surging-and-experts-believe-its-only-going-to-stay-that-way.html) which has led to and will probably lead to a stronger Euro.  

That said, I expect the Fed to continue to hike rates regardless of what happens across the pond meaning any disruption in the ECB's tightening program will allow the almighty greenback to make gainz.

(3) Greek unemployment is high but numbers are improving. Sitting at a [20.7%](https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-unemployment/greek-unemployment-at-20-7-percent-in-october-idUSEONI140S3) unemployment rate in October, there are a lot of people out of work in Greece.  Why is this good?  Because as their economy strengthens, those people will go back to work and put their recovery into hyperdrive.  What could go wrong?  That unemployment number could stay ridiculously high and less [baklava](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fWBmS9Ta9c0/maxresdefault.jpg) would be produced and we would see a weakening of the baklava/tendie exchange rate.

(4) [Baklava](https://data.thefeedfeed.com/recommended/post_4474762.jpeg) is fucking delicious.

Crayonzwow;1515902881;7q9o9g;;51;;28;"Hey fags, heres some DD for the coming year on the markets

GDP growth for 2018 is expected to grow, likely around 3%.
Signs of a late stage cycle, however if Trump focuses on infrastructure like he is planning it should add legs to the bull run.
Confidence in the economy hit 66% this week, the highest ever recorded.
Global GDP growth is set to continue throughout 2018.
most major investment firms believe the markets will grow throughout 2018 (Goldman, Merril, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley).
Consumer confidence hit all time high since 2000.
Consumer spending is likely to continue once financial relief from tax cut is realized.
2017 was the most expensive Christmas in US history.
Leading Economic Index (LEI) is not showing any signs of an incoming recession.

The bull market appears to be continuing steady through 2018, while markets appear over-valued we aren't quite yet in the melt-up stage. Investors have their sights set on infrastructure which will give an enormous boost to GDP leading into 2019. The markets are being driven by positive sentiment and speculation, and backed by economic growth/relief and fundamentals. I think if all goes as planned 2018 could be another year of dank gainz

paulie12;1515946999;7qcr71;;9;;6;"BSTI filed an S8 in December registering approximately 20 million shares at $0.69 (stock is currently trading 9 dollars). 

When they filed their S1 for their IPO they mentioned they planned on issuing approximately 20 million shares in the unknown future as stock compensation to reward those employees who started off early and that when those shares are awarded that it would affect earnings negatively. They also issued an extra 9 million shares at slightly above the current trading price. 

My question is does the s8 filing put those shares immediately in play? Does that mean BSTI will take a one time stock loss of $8 (9 dollars minus .69 approximately) x 20,000,000 shares? Meaning they will take a one time Q4 loss of $160,000,000? 

Does wall street usually overlook these one time expenses given that it was mentioned in the IPO or will it take everyone by surprise with an extra loss of 160mm for Q4? 

I interpret it in two different ways. 1. The company has decided that their stock price is at the bottom and decided to take the loss now to minimize losses in the future. 2. The company is a bunch of crooks who could have exercised the shares over time but decided to dilute everything in one shot.

Can anyone shed light on these S8 filings? This s8 filing seems awfully large for the company of this size (4 billion market cap). There are currently 227 million shares outstanding. Did this s8 dilute the company by 10% immediately at the detriment of shareholders? 

Thanks!

IamBamboozles;1515966892;7qeyns;Satire;14;;3;"The place you should study
Isn’t the bust
It’s the boom that should make you feel Leary
That’s the thrust of my theory
The Capitol structure is key
Mal-investments wreck the economy

The boom starts off
With an expansion of credit
The fed sets rates low,
Are you starting to get it?

That new money is confused 
For real lonable funds
But it’s just inflation 
That’s driving the ones
Who invest in new projects 
Like housing construction
The boom plants the seeds
For its future destruction

The savings aren’t real,
Consumptions up too
And they’re grasping for resources
Which reveals are too few

And the boom turns to bust
As interest rates rise
For the cost of production
Price signals relies

The boom was a binge,
That’s a matter of fact
Now it’s devalued Capital
That makes up the slack

Well there is the late 20’s
Or 2005
Where booming bad investments
Seems like they’d thrive
You must cease to invest
Don’t use the printing press
Or a bust will surely follow
An economy depressed

BlackBerry is a Canadian fall-from-grace hardware/phone manufacturer turned cyber security software company that peaked around 115$ per share back in 2008 and has gained 60% from recent lows to be now sitting at 13.78$.

In 2008 basically figured they were done, they were making Canadian headlines daily as they lost market share, but since 2008 it looks like they've been divesting, relying on some powerful income generating patents, while bringing an end to their hard-ware projects.

A lot of people lost a lot of money on this stocks run down / collapse but it seems like finally they've manage to end the hemorrhaging from running as a failed hardware business and are 'reset' to a small scale lean software business focused on being a leader in security for driverless/self-driving cars.

They've got a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 16.5 where the industry average is 47 and this is likely due to their reputation companies checkered history.

They recently got a bunch of contracts to implement security in cars for automotive companies and seem well positioned to continue and build on that as a foothold.

All I know is that US Crude oil inventories have fallen from 534 MMBO in April to ~415 MMBO, The API report today showed a 5.1 MMBO draw, Cushing had its biggest drop ever, Crude Imports are down a little, Crude exports are up a little, and it is too cold for domestic production to skyrocket. OPEC. Venezuala. Iran.

Buy some oil futures today, sell tomorrow after the EIA report.  What could possibly go wrong?

Many of the large brokerage houses allow you to place market sell orders in the pre and post market trading sessions. These orders won’t get filled till the market opens but will free up the entire position and credit your buying power. (Ex. Sell $50,000 in AAPL stock, get ~50,000 BP based on the expectation of that sell order getting filled). Now go ahead and place a buy order, get a fill in the pre market, and cancel that pesky market sell order. Boom - free $50k borrowed out of thin air. 

Next step: (1) sell that stock you bought pre market for massive gains; or (2) sell that stock you bought pre market at a significant loss &amp; wait for your broker to liquidate your account; or (3) ignore all incoming calls &amp; plead ignorance with your broker; or (4) do the same thing tomorrow.

MU's price is currently at 45$.

If I buy a call e.g.
A) 20JUL2018 40$ for 7$ per contract

Lyman-Zerga;1516631219;7s62ld;;6;;10;"The video game business saw revenues jump in 2017, rising 18 percent from 2016 to $36 billion. The increase is pretty much across the board, with hardware revenue up 19 percent and software revenue up 18 percent. 

Even though it is undergoing a transition from consoles to digital platforms, the gaming industry has racked up some substantial gains in 2017. Stocks of major gaming companies have shown double- to triple-digit gains this year. Moreover, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry's first fund dedicated to gaming – the ETF Managers Trust Video Game Tech is up by approximately 50% in 2017.

Research firm Goldman Sachs, which recently began coverage of the sector, stated that video game publishers are ""in the middle of a renaissance."" According to a report released by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC), global revenue from video games is expected to hit $93.2 billion by 2019. The firm estimates that global distribution for digital games will reach $12.9 billion during the same time period.

One thing I've noticed is that I'm kind of filtering out some potentially useful results because I'm requiring that there be some volume on the issue **today**. That weeds out some useless ones but it also puts the results at the mercy of other trades.

For instance I just opened a few SPY positions today:

bodhikarma;1516662658;7s9x40;;4;;3;"From another discussion board...

The reason for the intense focus on Omidria revenues is that it matters beyond Omidria's valuation. Omidria revenues collateralize the pipeline (OMS721). If Omidria cannot achieve $65mm in 2018 revenue, they can trigger a default which may allow the lender to take control of the pipeline. Without reimbursement, $65mm is a longshot.
From the latest 10Q: The CRG Loan Agreement requires us to achieve either (a) minimum net revenue amounts through the end of 2021, which are $55.0 million and $65.0 million for the 2017 and 2018 calendar years, respectively, or (b) a minimum market capitalization threshold equal to the product of 6.4 multiplied by the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the CRG Loan Agreement, determined as of the fifth business day following announcement of earnings results for the applicable year. If we are unable to satisfy the minimum annual revenue requirement or the market capitalization threshold for any given year, we may avoid a related default by repaying the shortfall between actual revenues and the minimum revenue requirement for such year using proceeds generated by an equity or subordinated debt issuance. We anticipate achieving the minimum net revenue requirement of $55.0 million for the 2017 calendar year.
The CRG Loan Agreement includes customary events of default (see Note 7 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016). If there is an event of default the lenders may have the right to accelerate all of our repayment obligations under the CRG Loan Agreement and to take control of our pledged assets, which consists of substantially all of our assets including our intellectual property. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate of an additional 4.00% per annum will apply to all outstanding obligations during the existence of an event of default. There was no event of default under the CRG Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2017.";;Omeros loan obligations...thoughts?;

Decided to run it again today. I realized I've been shooting myself in the foot since the minimum screener for volume on the option filters out a lot since I run it so early in the morning. 

At 9AM there may be no volume, but by 12pm there are hundreds traded of that option, meaning it would get screened out early but make it through if run later.

So I think from now on I'll run it a bit later in the day on Monday rather than early market hours (I always run it after the market opens but I'll wait a bit).

Between this and a few gold and VIX plays I've had nothing but gains since trading futures. For only having access to futures for a week it feels like I've mastered it already. I had the same feeling when I started with options and woke up with a $8k gain on a Monday.

So I have been diligently studying investing strategies and naturally decided all in on MU is the way to go. I sold all my shitty stocks and went all in at $47 or so.

Then the inexplicable happened, MU went down. I thought that maybe I had it wrong and should buy my shitty shares back. Then I thought about the odds of me being wrong and laughed. Clearly I wasn't wrong to buy it, the market just didn't know how to value it properly, so I wanted to buy more so I'd be richer when the market caught on. I didn't have any more money though so I sold some MU stock to buy MU options.

My problem is that this has happened like 4 times now and I don't have many MU shares left to sell, to buy MU options. Help me WSB what do I do when I run out of MU shares to sell if MU keeps dipping? How do I buy the dip then?";;I need MUch help;

Obviously the pure play is just buy infinity more calls but I'm wondering if there's some kinda spread play I could set up to make things a little less lopsided. Like if I wanted to sell some contracts how would I capture max IV?

...and I bought puts as a joke a few days ago when it started dropping like a rock from 179 and have made maybe $700 this week just cashing them out and buying a couple more cheap ones at the next lowest strike, and also picking up more calls along the way.

In October, Danaher $DHR reported Q3 earnings of $1.00 per share. That beat Wall Street’s forecast by five cents per share. Previously, the company told us to expect Q3 earnings to range between 92 and 96 cents per share.

Back in July, Danaher raised its full-year guidance range to $3.85 to $3.95 per share. Which was revised higher. Danaher raised its full-year guidance to a range of $3.96 to $4.00. Working out the math, that means they expect $1.12 to $1.16 per share for Q4. Danaher’s CEO recently said he sees earnings coming in at the higher end of that range. 

**Check Point Software $CHKP**

Shares of Check Point Software $CHKP got clobbered when the last earnings report came out. The Q3 earnings were fine, but the outlook wasn’t so hot. For Q4, Check Point sees earnings between $1.45 and $1.55 per share and revenue between $485 million and $525 million. Expecting volatility on the higher range of the band. *long straddle 

**Stryker $SYK**

In October, Stryker $SYK reported Q3 earnings of $1.52 per share, two cents better than estimates. For Q4, they expect $1.92 to $1.97 per share. Stryker sees full-year earnings in the range of $6.45 to $6.50 per share. Forex costs will be about 10 cents per share for the year.

Stryker recently raised its quarterly dividend by 11%. The payout went from 42.5 to 47 cents per share. The orthopedics company has raised its dividend every year since 1993.

**AFLAC $AFL**

The stock will report earnings on Wednesday, January 31. The CEO said that if the yen averages between 110 and 115 to the dollar, they expect Q4 earnings between $1.42 and $1.66 per share. Wall Street expects $1.55 per share. For 2018, they see operating earnings between $6.65 and $6.95 per share. That’s based on the yen averaging 112 to the dollar this year.

Now here is the part where it gets interesting published January, 12 / Marketwatch

*Shares of $AFL umbled 7.1% in active afternoon trade Friday, although the insurer said a report that former employees alleged fraud and abuse was ""false"" and ""without merit."" Volume spiked to 10.5 million shares, or more than 6-times the full-day average. The stock, which closed at a record $91.69 on Thursday, pared earlier intraday losses of as much as 8.7%. ""Recent media stories regarding Aflac contain false allegations made by a very small group of independent contractors. Aflac intends to aggressively fight these allegations beginning with filing for their dismissal,"" the company said in a statement.* 

*A report by The Intercept said Aflac exploited workers, manipulated accounting and deceived shareholders and customers, citing multiple current and former employees, as well as three previously unreported lawsuits. In Aflac's response, the company said it has ""investigated these claims and found them to be without merit.""*

MrTrader1;1517017103;7t9eqs;;85;;73;"Yeah i get it... short term weaker dollar is good for multi-national companies.  

All i hear is  people thinking interest rates and inflation will continue to stay very low for a long time. Oil and gold continues to moon, granted gold a little slower but rising nonetheless, and for what? its a stock market party.  But  if oil goes to the $80-100 range and it seems like that's not a dream anymore then it will have detrimental effects  to the consumer and economy. 

The dollar is plunging, bonds are plunging, yields are rising, commodities are rising. Who will buy our debt if the dollar and bonds continue to fall?  why would they when it appears commodities and other currencies are better investments. There is something happening in the market that the bulls refuse to acknowledge. Maybe Qe 4? is what every investor and trader is hoping for? Then goodbye dollar.

Inflation is coming, and stagflation will be next if the proper steps are not taken.

The same situation played out during 1987 and interest rates were extremely higher and look how that turned out. The dollar fell just as fast in such a short amount of time in the beginning of the year. The stock market had record high valuations, record amounts of debt only to crash hard as what was called black Monday.

Tell me i am wrong and why this won't happen. Literally wanting some rational discussion about the stock market and the U.S. dollar's health.


If the dollar breaks 85, i don't see any support...and if oil,gold, etc rocket higher then the party might be over faster than you all expected

edit: i am also having a hard time  pondering about the potential future infrastructure bill- that the stock market wants. How helpful would another trillion dollars of debt be with the falling dollar

RedditCleaned;1517197371;7tpkmj;;33;;95;"EDIT: Added Axes as well as a clarification as to why we are not near the peak yet (Second Graph with a hypothetical final NASDAQ value of ~9000 (conservatively vs 10,000).

**Main Graph of Bubble Peaks Compared (Added Axes)**
[Axes Added](https://i.imgur.com/o0ojNwR.png)
This demonstrates that the current ATH (yellow line) is not ""crazy"" enough relative to the previous values between 1000-500 days before peak.

**Previous 1000 days versus a peak of 9,000 (Hypothetical Projection)**
[Adjusted](https://i.imgur.com/vd4Ra2O.png)

Notice how this would put past values versus peak value more in line with previous bubbles, **which is why I argue we are not at the peak yet.**

Standard disclaimer: past performance is not indicative of future results and this does not constitute financial advice. It is simply food for thought that I think you will all find interesting at the very least. 

**Methodology**

I gathered historical data for the DJIA, Nikkei, and NASDAQ during three of the most significant bubbles in history:

* Roaring Twenties - 1929 Stock Market Crash
* Japanese Asset Price Bubble 1989
- Dot-Com Bubble of 2000

I then plotted the daily closing price versus time and searched for the peak closing value (and date) for each, resulting in the following values for the DJIA, Nikkei, and NASDAQ respectively. 

Peak Date | Peak Value
-----------------|------------------
9-3-1929 | 381.20
12-29-1989 | 38915.9
3-9-2000 | 5048.62

I then standardized all of the prices relative to the peak value so that the peak = 1000.

Example for the peak during 1929 Bubble:

= (381.20/Peak Value(381.20)) *1000 = 1000

Example for an earlier date (8-22-1929) with a value of 370:

= (370/Peak Value) *1000 = 970.56

This was done for all closing prices +/- 1000 days from the peak. These values were then aligned so that all peaks were equal to “Day 0” and any days prior are negative (-1000 to -1) and days after the peak were positive (1-1000). The resulting graph is shown above.

**Thoughts**
 The three bubbles evolved in a remarkably similar pattern. Although this may be confirmation bias, each showed signs of an early ‘bear trap,’ around -350 days, an explosion in prices around -80, a ‘bubble pop’ and temporary recovery between 40-100 days, and then the bottom falling out after that.

The NASDAQ bubble appears to have a much more explosive growth period (and subsequent decline) than the other two, which I feel is likely due to much more rapid dissemination of information during that time period. (foreshadowing?)

**Why I don’t we are at the peak yet**

Even though the month of January has been remarkable, I don’t think it has yet hit the point of “mass hysteria” that was present in both the Nikkei bubble and especially the NASDAQ bubble. 
By standardizing the values relative to the peak it can give some sense of how ‘ridiculous’ each bubble got before popping. 

**Edit** By setting Friday's value as a hypothetical “peak,"" we can see that the most recent run up This shows that the current price relative to prices between Days -1000 to -500 is really not all that ridiculous yet. The average standardized price between Days -1000 to -500 for the previous three bubbles was 405.89 versus a standardized price relative to today’s peak of 623.94. 

A final peak value of 9,000 or 10,000 for the NASDAQ would result in a standardized value of 520 or 468 for Days -1000 to -500 respectively. This final peak value would be much more similar to the previous three bubbles. Although, of course when it comes to bubbles, expect the unexpected.";;Why I don’t think we are at the peak yet, NASDAQ 10,000.;

WilliamNyeTho;1517200772;7tpvrr;;23;;36;"This is a leading market indicators thread.

Over the past few weeks, I, a shoeshiner, have started looking into the world of the stock market and have decided that leveraged ETFs are kickass, but require a reasonable market timing strategy. Thus, the need to discover leading market indicators that weren't total bullshit like the LEI was necessary.

Over the past weekend, I went rooting around for these indicators, and here's what I've found:

Strongest Leading Indicator - Motor Vehicle Retail Sales: Heavy Weight Trucks: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HTRUCKSSAAR

Strong Leading Indicator - New Private Housing Units Authorized by Building Permits
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PERMIT

Somewhat Strong Leading Indicator - Civilian Unemployment Rate (unemployment flatlining or starting to rise)
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE

Okayish Leading Indicator - Hotel Stock Prices Decline (Marriot, Hilton, etc)

My question to all of you is, have you found any more? We could easily put together a WSB leading market indicator index based on trends that aren't total garbage.";;We are going to keep going up. DD inside.;

the_darkmongoose;1517279207;7txqvp;;6;;4;"Polaris and Hog release earnings before the market opens tomorrow (Jan 30).  Polaris has a more diverse product line than good ole American Harley and Indian has been stealing market share from Harley(full disclosure, ride motorcycles).  I checked out an Indian Scout at a dealership over the summer and it was sexy as fuck.  If I can snag a few more tendies from SPY calls, I want an Indian as my next bike.

Also, after a long absence from the American Flat Track series (a racing series that Harley has dominated in their absence), Indian absolutely [blew everyone away](http://www.roadracingworld.com/news/american-flat-track-indian-scout-ftr750-becoming-popular-choice-for-privateer-racers/). They teased a street legal [track inspired 1200cc bike](http://www.indianmotorcycle.com/en-us/ftr1200) and I jizzed in my pants when I saw it.  If that thing goes into production it will dominate.

Polaris discontinued its struggling Victory motorcycle line [recently](http://www.startribune.com/polaris-says-it-s-the-end-of-the-line-for-victory-motorcycle-brand/410139155/) and is focusing its motorcycle energies on Indian which shows in a positive fashion.

One problem, however, is that millenials are snowflake pussies who don't have the disposable income or inclination to ride motorcycles so ridership as a whole is an aging and declining demographic despite the fact that riding is fucking awesome.

tl;dr: You should ride a motorcycle and Indian will be a strong positive to the Polaris bottom line for the foreseeable future.";;Polaris (DD);

Being a part of this sub for a while I know the humour towards TSLA seems never-ending, however my aim here is to create a serious discussion about the company and its future (with an appropriate measure of humour). 

To start with my own DD, I'm short selling Tesla as of last week and my reasons behind it are as follows: 

1.) The company has consistently undershot earnings estimates for years now, and although revenues are rising they're not nearly rising fast enough to close the gap (gross profit has infact fallen quarter after quarter for the whole of this year thus far). Tesla also as of recently achieved a ROIC % of -18.32. Thus as a company it is actually unable to make any money with the money you invest into it, it's simply losing it and then turning to the next nearest investor. 

2.) Interest expense represented a whopping 200,000$ in 2016. To put that in comparison, Alibaba paid 388,000$ in interest for the 2016, yet is actually profitable and has a market cap of almost 10 times the size of Tesla. Moreover, to make things worse Tesla have now announced they will accumulate even more debt through issuing another round of bonds (https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-tests-money-managers-demand-180753134.html). I almost also forgot to mention that US interest rates are being aggressively hiked this year (or at least forecasted to) thus for the long term debt Tesla holds (which is a huge proportion) it will see even bigger interest repayment bills. Finally, the more debt Tesla amasses the higher the premium it will have to pay to borrow (if it can find anyone left that will actually be willing to lend to them). 

3.) A more recent concern of mine which largely lead me to actually act on my bearish instinct with Tesla is the new pay package for Musk. In my eyes it's an 'All or nothing' experiment where he can gamble away government injected money in a hope to win big. If things begin to go south and market cap growth isn't reaching its target you can expect irrational short term behaviour to prop up the stock price at the expense of future returns. I.e. Its very likely long term debt will be accumulated to prop up the market cap at the expense of huge debt bills in the future and a rapidly deteriorating credit rating. 

4.) Teslas are a fairly niche market. They're not cheap and although they have a strong (some would say) cult following, they are soon going to be facing real competition from the likes of Daimler (parent of Mercedes) who have innovated aggressively since inception. Furthermore - with improving economic prospects for the Eurozone and the likes of German car manufacturers positioned well for the transition to electric cars, Tesla will be fighting a war on many fronts. More importantly this war will be fought against the same companies that have strong and deep customer loyalty rooted in the whole of Europe and well established trade routes with countries such as the UK and France. Their ability to trade freely across borders within the EU makes German Auto firms much more appealing to countries like Sweden and Norway where an electric car culture is becoming rapidly apparent. 

5.) Finally, Musk has missed every production target set thus far, by an extreme measure and to make matters worse key employees are packing up and moving elsewhere. Supply chain problems are also an issue and the actual ability to safely recycle lithium batteries remains at the forefront of environmental discussion. To make matters worse Trump is going to have to actually find a way to fund these policies he's pushing through to make 'everyone better off' and 'america great again'. In order to do exactly this he may begin by cutting the very thing he doesn't believe in... Climate Change. Tesla receives hordes of support from the government at present however with Trump not even sold on the idea, who's to say he doesn't turn around tomorrow and stop dishing out credits to firms battling this 'fantasy' as he puts it.

There are many other points to cover which I will in due discussion however these are a few of the key reasons why I believe Tesla is a solid short play. Although this is my opinion it is not financial advise and I wish to hear other peoples' opinions on both my own opinions and the future of Tesla. I have an abundance of respect for Musk. He is a fantastic man and is a complete visionary, however Rule 1 of trading is to ignore the heart and listen to the brain however hard they may repel in beliefs. 

p.s - Although Tesla may have been a good risk play in another scenario, I forgot to mention that it commands a forward P.E ratio of approx -80.5. This extreme premium for a company with such a long trail of risk. One last point before I force myself to stop - selling flamethrowers seems like an interesting way to raise capital but imo a stupid way, especially when you're the face of a multibillion dollar company. If a house burns down/someone is killed by one of these things Musk is gunna have a hell of a lot to answer for.";;TSLA. Real Talk.;

Buy April 150 puts for cheap, triple your money.

Why?

Simple... all their toying with censorship is pissing people off. Zuck is in the middle and can't win. Either he censors or he gets blamed for allowing crap.  Since he doesn't want blame, it's censorship.  Well -- the first time one of your posts gets flagged because it was a gif, fine.  After the fourth time, most people say fuck it, I'm not going on facebook if they are going to tell me what I can say and not say.

Simple.

So the Q1 results are going to be crappy as they are forced to scale down profitable ads from one camp and get less eyeballs and growth metrics on the other.

Look at the chart, tho!  Who would short into that strength?  Well, just how long in the tooth is this rally again?  Doubtlessly, you can wait to buy the puts after the top is put in, but those who want more than a triple could do what I do and make what I make alongside the winner of the 2016 call of the year on WallStreetBets.

This is gonna be fun watching the stock top out going into profit taking weakness in March/April/May.

With BABA reporting tomorrow and potentially dropping positive guidance (as per usual), do you think this could provide a bump to JD stock price? I'm inclined to drop some cash on JD FDs. Just wanna see if any of you special autists have some thoughts that might sway me.

Edit: Additional DD below

Again, I know they are different in a lot of ways, but valuations could theoretically still be viewed in the same way. If we use revenue only, BABA has an annual revenue of $25B a year with a valuation over $500B. This is a 20:1 revenue to valuation ratio. JD has an annual revenue of ~$41B and a valuation of just over $71B. That's under 2:1. The huge difference is that BABA is currently profitable and JD has historically not been. The huge factor that should play into the future is that JD has promised that it's done setting up infrastructure and is now ready to focus on income, meaning it should turn profitable in 2018. The question is by how much. And will their revenue continue to grow as fast if they slow on infrastructure growth. 

Like I said, I'm bullish on both thoughts. Just thinking this might be an opportunity for JD to run a little given the valuation potential in comparison with BABA. And it's fair to relate them, cause ya know, they're both Chinese. ";;Anyone get the feeling that JD will get a boost from BABA reporting tomorrow?;

SeekingTheta;1517455836;7ufv32;Fundamentals;51;;41;"Let's weigh in the con and pros arguments for why AAPL will beat estimates and guide higher.
note: **I have been wrong 3/4 last predictions so please inverse me**



**Cons**:

Let's start with the facts. Broadcom, TI and Qualcomm reported earnings stating that expectations for modems have tapered recently due to the iphone. Please see QCOM's latest transcript here:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/top-iphone-suppliers-warn-of-slower-sales-ahead-of-apple-results?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;utm_campaign=headline&amp;cmpId=yhoo.headline&amp;yptr=yahoo

Samsung also gave cautious guidance to OLED for mobile for 2018. In their CC, Samsung reported **23%** lower revenue than guidance for OLED for mobile phones.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Poor-iPhone-X-sales-weigh-down-Samsung-s-Oct.-Dec.-results

Furthermore, China mobile sales were very weak as compared to other years.
https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/MediaTek-expects-headwinds-in-China-mobile-market-in-2018





**Pros:**
1) 
The bloomberg article did not mention that Apple is now using intel modems (https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/31/apple-inc-may-have-wanted-to-use-intel-corps-modem.aspx). 
(https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/01/qualcomm-iphone-x-still-faster-than-intel/)
In fact during intel's CC, they've reported a huge growth in their mobile business unit.

2) 
The Korean Won was very strong this quarter due to bank of korea raising rates and growing peace between North and South. This headwind can account for 5% of the 23% lower revenue in OLED for mobile. Furthermore, we don't know exactly how much of the OLED goes to Apple although Samsung has exclusive rights to make the OLEDs for the Iphone X. 

Cautious guidance can be explained by other OLED mfgs such as LG's.

Therefore, it is my conclusion that Iphone X sales (in units) have moderated about 10%, but not as bad as other analysts have predicted. However, in revenue ($ USD) due to the weak dollar, Apple may have in fact beaten guidance despite the lukewarm sales.  

3) 
Latest Foxconn sales have shown a huge increase in revenue. Mark Hibben (Seeking Alpha) attributes the growth to the Iphone X sales solely.
https://i.imgur.com/ZXL1b8o.png

4) Apple's services will grow by more than 20% YoY. This is where the real growth is coming from. http://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/apple-siri-now-active-500m-devices/

5) Taxes and the 350B spending spree. This is self-explanatory. I believe that Apple has been using this quarter as an experimental period where they want to take the next GIANT leap in progress - just like what Mark Zuckerberg has done. They both know that they can get away with it - which is totally fair. Please see my previous post to cite for your research: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7txxw7/isnt_it_to_apples_benefit_to_lower_aapl_to/
   


6) Qorvo, an Apple supplier, has seen a bit weaker revenue but expects encouraging growth in later half of 2018:



7) TSMC reported 10nm revenue in the 2 consecutive quarters of 2.55E9  USD. Since virtually all 10nm goes to Apple at the moment, we see 2.55E9/($26 cost for A11)*1E-6 &lt;= (upper bound) 98M IPhone X sold. Although this is an upper bound, this is way way higher than the estimates calling for 15-20M.

*With Apple’s softer holiday sell-through being well reported over the past several weeks and QRVO’s stock already having declined about 20% from its highs in November, investors look to have already largely factored in QRVO’s lighter guidance, with the company’s shares remaining relatively flat in after-hours trading.
Also likely helping to support QRVO’s share price is its indication of “recent developments with mid/high-band PADs and Phase 6 design wins”, which include mid/high-band and low-band integrated PAD modules.  The company also sampled a custom mid/high-band PAD to an additional tier-one smartphone OEM. These mid/high-band PAD are significant as it has been the lack of high-performance BAW filter shipments that have recently weighed on its gross margins, particularly as it previously earned a high volume low-band PAD design with its largest customer that used SAW filters instead of the firm’s BAW designs.
Update: The stock has now staged quite an impressive turnaround, surging by $6.43, or almost 9%, at $78.20, and at one point almost 10% higher this evening. One thing that may be helping the company are remarks by management on the call that later this year, it expects to see the biggest-ever content gains in Apple products that it has ever seen for its wireless parts.**

**Conclusion**:  Analysts have been deceptively scooping your shares, and Apple is using this time to experiment and take the risks needed to still be innovative in an era where value and growth are perceived to not go hand in hand.

Awwtist;1517653444;7uylsy;;25;;79;"Here are select unedited comments from /r/all:

Investor#1: I'm no expert, but if my intuition is right, there's going to be a market crash, probably tech. That's why I've been afraid to invest in Vanguard since 2015. I'm just waiting for it to pass. Idk i might be totally wrong.

Investor#2: Primary thing I'm gathering from that article is sales haven't increased to match the surge in the stock market. If sales keep going down, the market will downturn. So it seems the market increased on speculation that profit margins would improve but they have been lagging and if sales don't improve, the market will head toward a decline. Whoever got the benefit of Trump's presidency better get out there and start buying with their tax breaks and wage increases. I would myself, but I haven't yet gotten a raise, bonus, or tax break. I've got food to buy and bills to pay. If that ain't enough to keep the market afloat, the more fortunate will have to pick up the slack and buy my share of unnecessary bullshit. (OP: I read the article, it didn't say anything about sales.)

Investor#3: The GDP numbers and more importantly wage gains looked surprisingly strong! The economy is getting better. This reduction is irrelevant in the larger picture of an improving economy that is lifting people off of food stamps and giving workers better wages. Investors are worried interest rates will go up because people are getting fatter paychecks and thus companies will have to shell out more of their profits to workers. This is actually good news, not bad. The stock market drop is actually a positive in this case.

Investor#4: Decided to start investing out of an IRA I opened in October. Three months in and I thought it was so easy. People are stupid for not doing this. Just put most of your money in ETFs! BOTZ was making a killing for me. Then this week wiped out almost all of my gains to date.

Investor#5: The dow is basically a bunch of stocks put together. Basically if its high that means people are putting their money down making informed bets about the future price of the stocks. But the stocks are more or less tied to the overall economy.

Investor#6: It's one of the indicators of the US economy. Considering half the US population has investments in the stock market (most through 401k), it's kind of a big deal.

Investor#7: Stock markets are in a bubble. Have you heard of tulip mania and beanie babies? Stocks are essentially the same thing! Edit: It's all a Ponzi scheme! Wake up, sheeple!

Genius#8: Well, I like to trade in (insert banned word)-currency. I laugh in the general direction of your 2.5% market drop. Ha ha!

Some guy on SSI#9: Jesus man. I’ve lived in this country my whole life and I can’t tell you how frustrating it is to not know what that means.

HinduHamma;1517692365;7v24vy;;63;;55;"Ok this week was a fucking blood bath and I'm not trying to catch a knife with the rest of my cash that I have on the sidelines - no point in degenerate gambling on calls (maybe puts though lol) right now since almost every single close this week was a fucking plunge into weakness with stupid amounts of selling instead of a strong close with buying volume. 

that means big money was not interested in buying the fucking dip...and right now, judging by the news and market sentiment, I don't see a reason they will BTFD next week either (I can see a deadcat bounce on tuesday which could be a good put buying opportunity thou if monday is another 1% plunge - watch the futures when they open back up tomorrow, could be a key sign as they were on the spot last week)

So, I think its just smart to wait out the storm which could be a week .. could be a month..either way its still a bull market and this will reverse as its always done in the past...just watch for strong buying volume and watch the daily/weekly charts and see when we have hit a floor...then wait for confirmation and uptrend signals...thats when it will be safest to enter back imo...bond/yields need to stabilize as well so keep an eye on that.

Theres going to be a serious BTFD opportunity that could be a game changer for everyones portfolios... so lets try to discuss somethings on buying calls? (shares work, but dude, get options enabled, seriously)

1) what kind of expiry y'all thinking about?

I'm thinking for shorter dated leaps (jan 2019)..anyone confident on quarterlies/monthlies? I don't like whats brewing for march/april with the fed meeting but it looks like the market is pricing it in now....also treasuries yield has not stopped gaining which makes me think we need to play it safer and wait for it to find a top and hope it settles..



2) wtf do i buy though?

slow and steady movers are the way to go imo..Visa, MSFT, JPM/BAC....non meme shit that won't get fucking dicked on by bullshit news/analyst/volatile markets like MU/AMD....I think these slightly OTM calls on those type of companies (or the indices) are solid bets like a $105 strike jan 19 MSFT ...not to expensive either...financial sector should remain great as people are spending money since they are making money..more loans..better interest rates..economy is stable for the most part..lot of positives in financials imo..anyone got some different opinions? maybe something in health care since they got a little extra beat down with the JPM/buffet/bezos threesome? or fuck it and go with meme shit anyways lol? AMD might actually have momentum this year

Tuesday Wednesday Thursday were sideways markets. Friday saw support become resistanceon the green 1 hr candle, as we were unable to get back in range and therefore fell straight down. We will go lower later on. This week should be a consolidation week, followed by more downside next week. Buying longer dated puts when volatility is reduced and market moves upwards in its high range is a prudent strategy. But we do not know this weeks range yet, so we need perhaps Monday and Tuesday to establish the range. But the broader range is within the channel. This week was extremely important in establishing parameters for determining future price action. PS: Don't use futures if you don't know what you're doing.

------------

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

- The market is beholden to central banks due to years of QE 

- The Stock/Bond return correlation is important to watch

- Diversification between stocks and bonds only works when this correlation is negative.

- If bonds selloff too quickly, the return correlation can flip positive.

- When this happens equities selloff along side bonds.

- Friday's jobs report showed higher than expected signs of inflation.

- If inflation spikes, the Fed will tighten monetary policy faster than previously expected.

- In anticipation of such a move, the market fell.

----

&amp;nbsp;

Now the entire “Goldilocks” environment that we have in the current economic climate hinges upon central banks (namely the US Federal Reserve) normalizing policy slowly and carefully. Why? [Because central banks have injected nearly $20 trillion dollars into global financial markets since 2009 and such a rising tide has lifted all boats. What happens when global QE is done and we start to see QT? We don't know because its never occurred on this scale before. Also worth mentioning is that the Fed will be the first to pull out later this year. [(You can read more about that here:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-28/federal-reserve-ponders-how-to-do-the-big-unwind-quicktake-q-a). 

- [Or see this fun chart of it](https://imgur.com/epFmlvl)

- [Another great chart showing QE suppressing risk premia in fixed income, forcing investors into riskier assets](https://imgur.com/yXtx68Y)

But don't just take my word for it, here's an exerpt from a BofAML note:

- ""In 2017, multi-asset portfolios continued to benefit from equity/bond diversification. Low equity/bond correlation alongside record low cross-asset volatility is driving the vol of equity/bond risk parity portfolios to its lowest levels since the 1960s. Other multi-asset portfolios holding a mixture of equities and bonds have likely also seen extremely low volatility recently. However, a disorderly rise in yields that accompanies an equity market pullback (i.e., 2013 Taper Tantrum) could be a surprise for many investors who have become conditioned to the recent environment in which bonds and equities diversify one another.

- [**CHART**](https://imgur.com/6qgkzVO). 

- ""**The correlation of rate-sensitive assets to US rates is at record highs** as investors fail to care about outside risks, leaving markets increasingly dependent on US policy. Coupled with rates vol near lifetime-lows - on few expectations for policy disruption - this has helped suppress global cross-asset vol. However, **with the Fed appearing to soldier-on towards policy normalization, persistently low rates vol may be at risk. [This in turn creates risks for a market slaved to rates](https://imgur.com/wk3TnYR).""**

The Fed began tightening 2 years ago but very slowly. As long as inflation remains subdued then they can’t yank away the punch bowl too quickly. But,on Friday morning we had a jobs report that had very positive average hourly earnings gains leading to worries about a marked uptick in wage pressures. Wage pressures are one of the key areas that we have not seen inflation in years. If inflation spikes unexpectedly and the Fed is caught with its pants down behind the curve, they will be forced to tighten monetary policy at a faster pace. This is a negative for risk assets.

&amp;nbsp;

**The other piece of the puzzle is the bond market.** 

Stocks and bonds tend to move inversely to one another as the former is riskier than the later. If you're a diversified investor with both stocks and bonds, you're doing that because if one market suffers the other ought to soften the blow to your portfolio. In a general sense think of bonds as safe investments and stocks as risky. There is a lot more to it but thats the general idea. When investors are bullish on the future and ""risk-on"" is alive, you would expect to see flows out of bonds and into stocks. (Like we did immediately post-2016 election). 

So starting with [this chart from goldman](https://imgur.com/HFuPJdp), (which is almost a year old but serves to illustrate my point), you can see how stocks and bonds tend to behave relative to one another over time. 

- The top left quadrant shows how a diversified 60% equities/40% bonds portfolio has performed over the long term. This is showing us in the dark blue spikes above the 0-line that such a portfolio has performed very well, better than the long term average (which is the horizontal light blue line). 

- Next look at the bottom right quadrant, which shows us the equity/bond return correlation shaded in dark blue. Now as you can see, aside from a few short instances, the correlation between equity and bond returns has been negative since 2000. [This means that since 2000 bonds have almost always rallied when equities have sold off.](https://imgur.com/rGZ9pJ7).Thus, diversified investors have been sheltered from losses as their bond holdings were intended to do. 

&amp;nbsp;

However when that return correlation flips positive, as it has many times in history, the two asset classes may sell off together and such a diversified portfolio may not help staunch the bleeding.

Now as bond prices and yields more inversely, most people will reference the US 10-yr Treasury bond yield as a benchmark or a thermometer of sorts. Rising bond yields can be a good thing, as it means investors are selling bonds and (hopefully) moving into equities or riskier investments. BUT, there a point at which a bond market selloff moves too quickly, yields spike faster than expected, and investors interpret that as a panic signal.


---


Now this week we saw bonds sell off dramatically, causing yields to spike above the comfort levels of many investors. This combined with the jobs report (and likely the political theater of today) spooked the market. Will it continue? Your guess is as good as mine but I think that ""BTFD"" will be muted next week due to the fervor of last week's volatility spike inverting the VIX curve.

Don't know how to crunch the numbers on how much the exposure is here, but:

- VIX shot up from 22 to 37ish in the span of an hour or so
- The Dow went from -800 to -1600 and back again in like 5 minutes

It seems to me that a lot of people got liquidated/margin called this afternoon and really accelerated this pullback. Interesting to see how this plays out of the next couple of days. Anyone know where to get current information on margin debt?

Circuit Breakers

In response to the market breaks in October 1987 and October 1989, the New York Stock Exchange instituted circuit breakers to reduce volatility and promote investor confidence. By implementing a pause in trading, investors are given time to assimilate incoming information and the ability to make informed choices during periods of high market volatility.

NYSE Rule 80B provides that a circuit-breaker halt for a Level 1 (7%) or Level 2 (13%) decline in the S&amp;P 500 Index occurring after 9:30 a.m. Eastern and up to and including 3:25 p.m. Eastern, or in the case of an early scheduled close, 12:25 p.m. Eastern, would result in a trading halt in all stocks for 15 minutes. If the S&amp;P 500 Index declines by 20%, triggering a Level 3 circuit-breaker, at any time, trading would be halted for the remainder of the day.

A Level 1 or Level 2 halt can only occur once per trading day. For example, following the reopening of trading after a Level 1 Market Decline halt, the NYSE would not halt the market again unless a Level 2 Market Decline was to occur. Likewise, following the reopening of trading after a Level 2 Market Decline, the NYSE would not halt trading again unless a Level 3 Market Decline were to occur, at which point, trading in all stocks would be halted until the primary market opens the next trading day.

Outlook:

	2018 is due to be a big year for Martin Marietta Materials. Following the passage of President Trump’s historic tax overhaul, the President’s persistence is now focused on pushing his infrastructure agenda through Capitol Hill. It is anticipated that President Trump’s infrastructure spending bill will reap numerous benefits for the U.S. Economy and U.S. firms that are leaders in the infrastructure repair and rebuild sector alike. In my opinion, President Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts bill overhaul, combined with mass infrastructure spending, will improve both GDP and consumer confidence.   
          The increase in GDP will be a ancillary result of an increase in government spending - due to the spending increase inherent in the Bill.  An increase in GDP will also, in turn, inspire consumer confidence as a byproduct, which is certain to encourage startups, manufacturing and inventory expansion, and overall growth in many sectors of the US economy. In addition, an increase in personal consumption attributed not only to government contracting in the private industry, but also to personal and business tax cuts, will give certain domestic industries that have been impacted by price/cost downward pressures, evidenced by the absolutely stagnant rate of inflation for the past 8 years, some breathing room on inventory and pricing increase.   
        One sector of these industries that will be positively impacted will be the aggregates and heavy materials building companies. Due to massive cutbacks in the DOT - employment went from 16k to 10k in 10 years - it is likely that the DOT will need to begin outsourcing differently, and will likely turn to the U.S. private sector to advance the pace of infrastructure work that the Trump Administration has prioritized for US cities and highways, infrastructure repairs, and rebuilds. It is my opinion that industry-leading basic materials firms like Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta Materials will be well-positioned to garner the lion’s share of these contracts. The decision between the two companies will come down to competitive bidding, as well as to preexisting established relationships with the current Presidential Administration

$BTU largest coal operations firm in the World

Outlook:

	Earning call is February 7, 2018. -15.9% projected revenue growth provides evidence that $BTU will struggle to meet revenue estimates. $BTU is highly leveraged with a debt/equity ratio of over 2500%. Additionally $BTU has a negative return on equity ( -18.2%) and assets (-.09). $BTU’s trading and brokerage operations reported a revenue loss of -10.90M. $BTU’s projected 3 year revenue growth in its U.S. and Australian mining operations are -11.33% and -12.96%, respectively, which reflects a gross misallocation of resources. Under, “Other” operations, generating revenue of $19.10M in 2016, reported a projected 3 year revenue growth of -20.40%.

The competitive nature of Natural Gas prices pose a threat to coal consumption which could lead to a global oversupply. $BTU is an obvious short sale because all operations are based in primarily democratic states who can impose environmental regulation. 

Additionally, $BTU’s current stream of revenue, as well as future revenue growth, put to question whether or not $BTU faces a general opportunity cost: whether or not C02 allowances are worth their cost when considering revenue declines.

One should also take into consideration the current and forecasted decline in US coal consumption and exports. This may be attributed to an increased use in natural gas and recent cost reductions concerning renewable energy.

$BTU is an obvious short sale because all operations are based in primarily democratic states who can impose environmental regulation. Additionally, $BTU is one of the only firms which does not run operations out of the appalachians.

The markets started acting crazy so i decided to just sit the day out and not trade. At 8PM i decided to log in to check my mutual funds updated NAV for the day to see how much i lost. Turns out the order i thought i canceled actually filled and since it was for todays expiration is worth about $6200 for a profit of about $5700 or ~1100% (fidelity is basing value off of the current after hours bid which is inaccurate. actual profit is 1100%. it expired at close so tomorrow my account will be credited $6200)

This is my most profitable trading day ever because I am a conservative loser who has 30K in a mutual fund and the other 50K in cash and it was completely by accident. If I knew it filled i probably would have ended up selling it for a $100 loss 5 mins later.

So last Friday, I bought some Feb 14 calls of the VIX with a strike price of 17. This was close to at the money I believe.

Today, as you all know, VIX jumped to over $37 by end of day. I decided to realize my gains sold my calls for just under 360% gain. I was ecstatic with the return.

But...now that I think about it...I had bought the calls for 1.50 each, and sold for 6.90. That's a gain of $540/contract.

But what if I just exercised the option? I would have bought 100 shares at $17, and immediately sold them for $37...that's $2000 gain per/contract.

Am I missing something? I've never exercised an option before, pretty new to derivatives altogether. I thought I'd learn by getting my toes wet with the VIX and got lucky. I thought in-the-money options were priced with the gain embedded so that it would be easier to sell the option and realize the same gain than if I exercised it.

Either way, I'm happen with the most profitable trade in my short trading career, but I'd like to know how to prevent this mistake again if it was in fact a mistake on my part.

Mad props to whoever that came up with it. 

I'm not sure if the logo has been discussed before, but the WSB kid was dressed up as ""Old Master Q"", a ridiculously popular Hong Kong comic series that began in the 1960s. It has a sizeable following among the Chinese diaspora and is considered a cultural icon.

I really can't think of a contemporary US equivalent but he is generally not described as an exemplary figure, nor is he someone regularly portrayed as someone related to the stock market.

I don't even know if Old Master Q comics are sold in the states or whether the humour would work over there.

Tyler77i;1517912927;7vmh69;;17;;12;"We all got our butts puckered for market open, at the time of writing this(4:30AM EST) it looks like we might have a green day, if that's the case I want to discuss the pros and cons of some of the possible positions you can take to play this volatility as best as possible.  Someone's gotta put those tendies on the table right?

*ASSUMING WE HAVE A GREEN DAY/GREEN WEEK(s)*


**VIX Puts**

Jumped **6** points Friday and **19** points Monday.

Trading at **39.XX**(4:48AM EST) Closed @ 37

52 Week average is between 13-10

With this I'm confident it wouldn't instantly drop back to the teens(11-19), I believe that if we have a half decent day, we might get to 21-25, but that's only today, if the green continues we could hit upper teens.  I wouldn't go for February 7th, that's extremely ballsy and certainly plenty of money to make in this volatility, but you could also be donating your money to Goldman Sachs if the market flips.

**In short** I'm looking at February 14th or 21st 21-24P

 **UVXY Puts**

Jumped **3** points Friday and **11** points Monday

Trading at **28.XX**(5:07AM EST)  Closed @ 22

52 Week average is between 14-16

I really don't think this would drop AS hard as $VIX would, but I could be wrong.  I'd be more willing to purchase 1-2 month out puts on this but give me your ideas.

**In short** I'm looking at March-April 18-20P

**TQQQ/QQQ Calls**

TQQQ dropped **8** points Friday and **15** points Monday

$TQQQ trades at 140.xx(5:18AM EST)

QQQ dropped **3** points Friday and **5** points Monday

$QQQ trades at 157.xx(5:18AM EST)

I grouped these together because TQQQ is a 3x leveraged QQQ, if you're new here you might not know that.  We choose to jerk these two off till their raw meat.  Between these two aim pretty torn.  On one hand I feel this market is already bringing enough volatility, so no need to 3x it with TQQQ, but on the other, if you pick right you could make away huge.  It's really up to you on how safe you're feeling.  Looking at the premiums right now though, these look pretty overvalued to me.  You have strike prices and premiums that have a massive jump almost already priced in.  Let me know what you think though.

**SPY/SPX**  

These ones have also had their fair share of beatings as of late, but it seems, in my opinion, maybe you differ, that it's too late to get in these at a solid price.  You have crazy premiums spread out everywhere.  Tell me what you think though.

_______________________________________________________
Stock indexes around the world continued to plunge Monday, but investors point to one reassuring factor in global markets: People aren’t getting nervous about corporate credit.

The difference between yields on corporate bonds and less risky government debt continues to narrow, suggesting that share-price declines aren’t because of widespread fears about the financial health of the world’s companies.

Previous U.S. equity-market corrections since the 2008 credit crisis have been matched by big moves in corporate-credit spreads, as investors sought a higher premium over government bonds to compensate for their increased concerns over corporate health.


Spreads on dollar- and euro-denominated corporate credit ticked down to their lowest levels since 2007 Friday, indicating that bond buyers don’t currently require a greater payoff against the risk that such debt defaults.

For example, while Apple Inc.’s stock is now down about 7.5% in the year to date, spreads on the company’s 2027 bonds have dropped to 0.59 percentage point Monday from 0.65 percentage point at the beginning of the year.

U.S. corporate bonds offered yields just 1.1 percentage points more than government bonds of the same maturity, according to IHS Markit ’s iBoxx indexes, barely higher than Friday’s 1.08 points, the lowest level seen since 2007.

The spread on European corporate bonds was even lower on Friday, at just 0.82 percentage point.

On Monday, European, Asian and U.S. stocks fell again. The Stoxx Europe 600 sank 1.6%, the largest drop in a year and a half, Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average fell 2.5% and the S&amp;P 500 slid 4.1%. The spread on European corporate bonds barely budged, ending at 0.83 percentage point.

“I think the resilience of credit to the most recent selloff within equity should provide equity investors with a little bit of comfort,” said David Riley, head of credit strategy at BlueBay Asset Management.

“It suggests credit investors still feel very comfortable with corporate-credit fundamentals, the earnings outlook and the ability of the corporate sector to absorb higher rates,” he added.

During previous market turns like the nearly 14% drop of the S&amp;P 500 in February 2016 from its May 2015 high, the spread on the iBoxx U.S. corporate index rose by nearly 0.9 of a percentage point.

Similarly, during the height of the European sovereign-debt crisis in 2011, when the S&amp;P 500 dropped 18%, corporate spreads rose 1.7 percentage points.

To be sure, those share-price declines were far larger than the drawdown in global equities over the past week.

But so far, there is little indication that the selloffs are based on expectations of significantly deteriorating economic conditions and company profits are mostly beating expectations. With roughly half of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported their fourth-quarter earnings, 78% have beat analysts’ expectations, compared with 64% in a typical quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.

“Really, there is no recessionary risk out there that’s telling you not to invest in bonds paid for by the cash flow of companies,” said Ewan McAlpine, senior client portfolio manager at Royal London Asset Management.

Data on Monday continued to point to an acceleration in global growth that should be supportive for both stocks and credit. The IHS Markit eurozone January purchasing-managers index reached its highest level since June 2006, while the U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s nonmanufacturing PMI rose to 59.9, well above the 56.5 expected.

The credit market “is a supportive factor in my view that I don’t think we’ve hit the turn in the equity markets,” said Dave Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.

So why are stocks falling?

The difference between the two asset classes this week may in part reflect stocks’ more exuberant start to the year. Equity markets drew record inflows and the S&amp;P 500 rose 5.6% in January, its biggest monthly gain since March 2016. Since the beginning of the year, credit spreads on both the euro and dollar iBoxx corporate indexes have declined by roughly 0.1 percentage point.

“All of the discussion at the moment that is negative about the equity market, none of it is about the economics, it’s all about those valuations and ratios,” Mr. McAlpine said.

Investors have been debating whether U.S. stocks look expensive, and what valuation should be used to measure that. The S&amp;P 500’s 12-month rolling price/earnings ratio, a popular valuation measure, reached 23.4 in January, its highest level since 2002.


On Monday, S&amp;P Global Ratings warned that the global proportion of highly leveraged companies, with a debt-to-earnings ratio above 5 to 1, has risen by 5 percentage points since 2007, to 37%.

Higher debt levels leave companies vulnerable to unexpected fast increases in interest rates, which would make it more costly to pay off their debt.

“When you are seeing this type of volatility, it does raise the question of whether credit spreads should be trading near all-time tights,” said Sunil Krishnan, head of multiassets funds at Aviva Investors. “I don’t think you’re getting very good compensation for volatility.”";;Credit Markets to Stock Investors: Calm Down ~ WSJ;

Usually things meander around for a little while and then take a dump after the market closes. An easy way to cash in on spikes and drops in the after hours is to open a very short term reverse calendar spread just before the market closes, and then sell it the next morning. If the market moves in either direction, you're golden. It's also an easy way to get some quick trading in without violating day trading regulations. ;;How to cash in on volatility.;

cryptoMathDude;1517958956;7vrl1v;;3;;5;"SVXY is ETF and has to have real assets underneath. XIV is ETN so as long as it just mimicks the move of the underlying, issuer was good to go.

So, when NAV went to $3, ProShares didn't have any incentive to liquidate the assets and loose chance to earn the fees. XIV on the other hand being an ETN (was probably not backed up by real assets) and hence when Credit Suisse ran into loss with whatever dollar it had set aside, it decided to scuttle it. 

Another reason is if you looked at the short holdings of SVXY vs XIV on Feb 5, XIV had higher percentage short of Feb contracts and less of Mar contracts. SVXY on the other hand was more short of Mar contracts. Feb contracts had exploded 75% and Mar had exploded 50%. XIV thus had to buy much more of expensive one. What that makes me think is XIV was probably being mismanaged. Again they can choose to mismanage it as there is no real underlying that they keep at a bank. XIV and SVXY were supposed to move in tandem.

Edit: Even if XIV had the provision to liquidate, Credit Suisse wouldn't want to liquidate it if it had any positive NAV left as it generates fees. ";;How SVXY survived and XIV didn't;

--

Snap’s first year as a public company has been marked by hurdles, including the loss of its heads of product and engineering. Facebook Inc. has copied some of Snapchat’s most popular features for bigger audiences, while a dramatic redesign of the Snapchat app is rolling out slowly. The numbers on Tuesday may help some on Wall Street revisit their original thesis on the company: that Snap, already popular with young people, has enough growth potential to carve out a solid slice of a digital ad market dominated by Facebook and Google.

In the middle of 2017, Snap began moving to an automated bidding process for selling ads, making it easier for more marketers to buy spots. By October, the system was mandatory. Though that dented average prices, the hit was offset by new customers and a rising number of ad views.

Snap said fourth-quarter sales jumped 72 percent to $285.7 million, beating the $252.8 million average projection of analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Snapchat had 187 million daily active users in the fourth quarter, up 18 percent from a year ago and ahead of the 184.3 million analysts estimated.

Steady Growth

Snap's daily active users is approaching 200 million

Source: Bloomberg

Excluding certain items, the Los Angeles-based company reported a loss of 13 cents a share, compared to the 16-cent loss analysts predicted. The net loss was $350 million in the fourth quarter, for a full-year loss of $3.45 billion.

Average revenue per user, a closely watched number, rose 46 percent to $1.53 in the final period of 2017, while a similar measure of costs grew much more slowly, according to the company.";;SNAP skyrockets like Falcon Heavy after (meh) earningd;

Let's do what we do and put together a list of potential targets so that we can get some of those chicken nugget things y'all talk about. 

I've been following NWL since it sold off when management announced that they're considering selling assets and that they fired 3 board members. NWL owns a shit load of well known brand names: Sharpie,  Elmers, Graco, Paper Mate, Mr. Coffee, Oster, Marmot, Yankee Candle, Calphalon, Rubbermaid, Rawlings, X-Acto, Crockpot, Rainbow, Coleman, K2 … 

Icahn spoke midday yesterday and after that time, NWL took off and finished up 10%. I realize there are hundreds of other companies he could be referring to, but I don't see any reason to rule this out. I know he tends to focus on industrials and doing massive auto roll-up. Maybe he's going after AAP.

For some reason anyone who's currently a sophomore or younger will ask for your snap instead of your number to talk. Occasionally people still use snapmaps, but its useless most of the time since most people are in ghost mode because letting people see your location 24/7 is fucking creepy.

FAFASGR;1518106509;7w5w66;;2;;2;"Petrofac is an O&amp;G services company that has lost over 50% of its value in 2017 due to an ongoing investigation conducted by the Serious Fraud Office in the UK. The investigation is part of a wider investigation into Unaoil, implicated in bribing government officials worldwide for a large number of oil companies including Rolls Royce, Haliburton, Honeywell, and KBR among others. 

Petrofac’s fundamentals are still healthy, and the market is mispricing the negative impact that the investigation will have on the company.

The company saw a large decline in order intake in 2016 due to lower oil prices which will translate into lower revenues until 2019 due to the lag time from order intake to revenue. However, this decline is still lower than the declines faced by the sector as a whole due to Petrofac’s focus on the MENA region where capex reductions have been less pronounced.
Combined with its focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement Petrofac’s fundamental business is in a better position than its peers and yet its trading at a significant discount to them.

The SFO investigation is highly unlikely to result in a fine larger than $400-$600M but the market is pricing in a total negative impact of up to $2B.

All alleged bribes occurred prior to 2011, when the UK Bribery Act went into effect, and therefore if the case goes to litigation Petrofac will be tried under the notoriously ineffective previous anti-bribery regime.

The company has continued to enjoy the same win rates on tenders it has historically had and had announced $5.8B in new orders so far for FY 2017, significantly higher than expected. Therefore, the investigation has clearly not affected its revenue generation capabilities.

Petrofac has a healthy liquidity position and banks have agreed to refinance large parts of its debt even after the investigation announcement.

There is further likelihood that the depressed current price will trigger a potential attempt at a hostile takeover by one of its competitors which will significantly increase the current price. Despite the fact that the CEO owns 18.2% of the shares, the fact that he appears to be implicated in the scandal will give a potential acquirer more negotiation power.

I therefore expect Petrofac to climb by approximately 50% by year end 2018. Earnings come out March 1 and that will likely be the catalyst that pushes it up. ";;Buy Petrofac. PFC:LN. Market is overreacting to a bribery investigation.;

highschoolhero2;1518108178;7w63pm;;395;;912;"**1) Rising Interest Rates**

This in and of itself is not a serious concern. But the manner in which it is happening should be something to pay attention to. [As the yield curve continues to flatten](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-06/does-a-flattening-yield-curve-mean-recession) the prospect of a 2019 Recession grows more and more.

**2) Increased Volatility**

The time of suppressed volatility is categorically over. I seriously doubt that we will ever see volatility fall below 12 for at least another 3-5 years. This low volatility environment has made many people complacent and as it continues to rise, the fear in the market will follow.

**3) Market Valuation**

[The current market P/E Ratio is at 32.10](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/), the highest it has been since December 1999. This is likely a result of massive overextension in popular tech names that have P/E Ratios of over 50 in this environment of irrational exuberance.

Another concern is the Market Valuation to GDP ratio. This is also known as the ""Buffett Ratio"". This ratio has NEVER been higher than it is right now and should be a serious concern in terms of valuations in this market. 

**4) Margin Debt**

I seriously believe that this is one of the greatest concerns in the market today. [The stock market is currently being propped up by $600 Billion of completely fake money in the form of margin debt.](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2017/12/27/a-look-at-nyse-margin-debt-and-the-market)

**5) Warren Buffett Cash Balance**

This one is more anecdotal but I find it to be the most concerning. At the moment, [Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is sitting on a $109 Billion Cash pile](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/07/warren-buffetts-109-billion-cash-problem-how-much.aspx). I've got a really bad feeling that he is waiting for something awful to happen before scooping up cheap shares from weak hands.

flopsie123;1518110086;7w6cq0;RETARD STRENGTH;434;;1349;"Yesterday at 4:10pm EST I sold the 266.50/266.00 put spread for a 2 cent credit. 1,000 of them. I guess at 4:14 or 4:15 before the option expired SPY must've dipped below 266.50 because I woke up the next morning before the market opened and saw my balance was up about $140k. I thought it was a glitch with the Etrade app at first but then looked at my portfolio and saw what happened. For some reason I was assigned only 863 of the 1000 put contracts I sold. That's 86,300 shares of SPY which is about $23,000,000 worth. I only had $50,000 in my account so I started panicking and wondering if Etrade would liquidate my account or something, so I put in a limit order of 268 (SPY was trading around 268.12 at the time), hoping the sale would go through immediately. After putting in the order a message popped up saying my order would be put through when the market opened, which I don't understand because I thought you could buy and sell stocks/ETFs during premarket hours. So anyway I was stuck staring at my phone's screen until 9:30 when the market opened. Immediately about half my shares sold for $268 each. The market seemed to be dropping so I lowered my limit for the rest to 267.60 and the rest of them sold for that price. After all that my balance was about $112k higher than it was yesterday. Does anyone know how much interest Etrade will charge me for holding 23 million dollars of SPY for these few hours?

It says ""Crash?"" with a time frame of sometime in 2018. So I've been sitting on the sidelines with cash. Am I right? probably not. Did I know it was going to happen? nope. Did this stop me from buying in the market? nope. Just made me more cautious.

This past week has had a pretty big drop. Around 7%. We haven't ""crashed"" just yet, but IF people continue to panic sell and some more bad shit news comes out like something to suggest instability in the US, then you have a good chance of continued momentum downward.

This is the chart continued

https://www.tradingview.com/x/x4DCVAMy/

In this chart, here you can see that it broke out of the upwards channel and as soon as it hit the upper IV line, it got rejected. Why it happened? I don't know. Just that in my experience from trading, I've always seen the prices bounce around these levels. 

Good luck!

XSP is a market ETF that tracks the SPY pretty closely. It pays a 1.4% dividend and is relatively cheap. 

At the current price of rejection  @ 32.00 ish a full on crash, you might expect things to tank to around 50%. Plan for 60% to be safe. So reasonably, an expectation of a 13.00 to 16.00 range

This gives you around 5 to 6 different entries. @50% 

If you're starting at 27.50 with $5100 in the bank

 To maximize your entries, you should be increasing your entries by 50% of the previous. This will bring you about one IV deviation from the bottom in the event of a reversal.

27.50 - $242 - 9 shares
24.50 - $363 - 14 shares
22.25 - $545 - 24 shares
20.00 - $816 - 40  -shares
17.65  - $1225- 69 shares
14.50 - $1837 - 126 shares

Average share price  $17.82 less w.e you collect in dividends.

If you're starting like me and making bad trades , then you've probably taken an entry  at 30 - approx. 6% drop.

If the market continues sideways or upwards, you're going to want to get time in the market as well. So a good plan is to divided the amount you have over the number of weeks it takes you to save that same amount.  So if it takes you 1 year to save $5000, you're looking at putting around $100 in the market every week (trying to continue buying the same amount of shares every week). This will put you at an expected return  of 6 to 7% + dividends.

In the mean time the god-damn 10 YR could see a pull back to 2.6 level as it is currently making a bearish pattern on the hourly chart. 

The current pattern on the chart of the god-damn 10 YR over the last 4 days is still inside the large drop we saw on the 5th, which tells us that the god-damn 10 YR is not out of the woods, but can in fact retest those lows.

Short-term we could see more volatility, and I don't think anyone is thinking that we can see a sharp, and short pullback from over-bought levels. (Emphasis short-term.)

stratomaster82;1518147862;7war00;;20;;17;I used to only buy and hold stocks, and made some pretty decent returns over the years because my start was around 2008.  Fast forward to more recently, when I first started reading this sub I was inspired to learn options.  Got some money from my mom, and lost a shitload of money in options, but feel much more a part of this community being an options trader, so it worked out.  Plus it wasn't my money so I didn't give a fuck. What I do give a fuck about is that gravy train ran out of gravy.  She kept feeding the options beast, but the market manipulators kept sabotaging stocks like RAD, and I (and mom) fell victim to this. Now I'm noticing a lot of talk about margin.  Now I've never used margin, but I've got a plan to implement it.  We're clearly in a dip.  Tomorrow morning I'm going to apply (do you apply?) for margin.  Then I'm going to buy a shitload of stocks that are discounted.  Then I'm just going to watch them take off and collect the fat profits from my margin. This strategy is all about timing, and the timing couldn't be better.  This is as low as they can get according to some stuff I read. This is my plan, and if you don't have margin I'd recommend you implement it as well. ;;Here's my plan *Margin Edition;

The **sixth circle** are the shitposters. They lost all their money long ago and now spend their time downvoting DD and posting faggot memes.

I believe the 4 Yr moving average to be a strong support level. The 4 Yr moving average held after the 2015 Chinese Stock Market Bubble collapsed around in early 2016 and therefore I believe it will work now. Also with the Chinese New Years is coming up and investors may want to lock in gains before the week long holidays. Back in 2016, Chinese markets faced something similar.

I will open or close positions based on what the market does specifically tomorrow. Whether it’s up Down or sideways to shit I am doing something.


**market down, VIX up** 


This is what I need. VIX up and SPY up so I can close it up at a massive gain and go look for some dumb shit to write cash secured puts on like $amd because IV is inflated, then cash in once VIX is $29 again.


**market up, VIX down**


This is unfortunately my bad scenario. I’m hoping speigels malnourished baby (snap) has some profit taking occur so I can take a gain to offset my inevitable SPY loss.


**market sideways then Cramer calls out WSB and r/personalfinance mods can’t keep up with 401k exit posts**


This is where I probably will close up at least one SPY put and maybe my RIOT put if I can time the market. I don’t want to be assigned riot shares, and I don’t want to risk $1000 or so on a SPY bet. I can’t hedge against my SPY puts because I am so poor I cant write a cash secured put on it at a lower strike. What’s this margin that everyone’s talking about?

Imagine you are driving around in your Jaguar F-type R and you see a 55 mph speed limit sign.  You come to a dead stop and stomp on the gas.  A cop comes and pulls you over and tells you that you were traveling at a high rate of speed.  You smile and say to that jackass that there is no such thing as a rate of speed limit and that you simply accelerated to 55 mph.  You go on further to explain that speed is the rate of distance over time, and that acceleration is the rate of speed over time.  The cop nods and gives you his girlfriend as a trophy for your superior intellect.

Trading in VIX^2 is just like that.  Why cruise at 55 mph worried about the next speed trap when you can zoom up to that speed in a matter of a few seconds, skid out of control and zoom back up again?

I don't know where to put my cash though. Knowing that what we're witnessing is really just a bunch of panic and doomsaying rather than a turn in the economy - I'm considering buying into some big dip on a company like Google (maybe Alibaba), but I'm also torn between investing into a fund that inverses the VIX. It's riding at bottom levels right now, since a few days ago obviously, and I doubt this unsurity is going to last forever - so I'm thinking my money may be best put there for when the dust settles, and then it can fly up again, but I'm admittedly inexperienced with how quickly the VIX can settle back down. It was riding super low for a long time, are we going to go back there again?

There are a lot of chapters in this book so let’s start somewhere in the middle.

**Chapter 15**

*Technique of Selecting Preferred Stocks for Investment*

-This chapter seems to be about preferred stocks. We know that WSB’s preferred stocks are MU and AMD. But this book was written a few hundred years ago so they probably had different preferred stocks back then. Maybe GE?

-He starts talking about trains (railroads), I think this guy is autistic.

-My man Gram talks about cumulative vs. non-cumulative issues. Apparently, back in the day companies couldn’t miss dividend payments, and these were called *cumulative issues*. Then the companies realized that was dumb and started missing dividend payments, and that was called *non-cumulative issues*.

tl;dr - don't read chapter 15 of security analysis its dumb as fuck

You guys who are overreacting are caught up in the hype instead of the reality. Unless you are trading options this pullback isnt a huge deal.

Sure the market can truly crash but we havent lost 2 years of value only a correction of 1 or 2 months worth of value, at most 4. The only reason we experienced the worst point loss in 10 years is because things went so high, if it was the worst percentage loss wed have something to worry about.

Cenovus Energy (CVE):

&gt; Cenovus Energy is a Canadian Integrated E&amp;P
&gt; company with 281kboepd of production (lt/med oil
&gt; 11%, oil sands 50%, other heavy 13%, natural gas
&gt; 26%) and 230kbpd of refining capacity. Most of
&gt; the company's production is from oil sands
&gt; projects (all of which are SAGD - Cenovus has no
&gt; oil sands mining projects), but it also has sizeable
&gt; conventional oil and gas developments. Projects
&gt; are developed in phases with repeatable
&gt; concepts/designs.

As energy/oil stocks have been hit harder than most during the past few weeks, Cenovus has fallen nearly 30% based on no new information other than systemic issues with the sector.

As the price of oil has declined the past week and change (~10% drop), $55-60 per barrel of WTI is near the bottom of the economical scale that makes sense for oil sands projects. 

CVE though has a solvent-aided process (SAP) technology that allows it to be near break even as low as $45 per barrell, far below what other competitors would live at. This technology though is *just* starting to be put into place and will take several months for a full roll out, but should allow CVE to be among the lowest cost oil sand producers out there.

In December, CVE released its [2018 guidance](http://www.cenovus.com/news/news-releases/2017/12-14-2017-cenovus-s-2018-budget-continues-focus-on-deleveraging.pdf) citing several cost savings:

(2018 budget vs. Nov. 1, 2017 guidance)

Per-barrel oil sands operating costs – down 8%

Per-barrel Deep Basin operating costs – down 11%

Per-barrel oil sands sustaining capital costs – down 12%

Christina Lake phase G go-forward capital efficiencies – a 21% improvement (vs. previous estimate)

Total oil sands production – up 26%

Now a major negative is that CVE has taken significant focus in deleveraging their balance sheet. To do this, they've had to sell off assets. Obviously this will lead to lower net income, but it also means lower debt payments and capex reductions, leading to high equity value. 

On Friday, a worker died at their Christina Lake facility as a drilling rig was being moved. Though this may have had an impact on the stock, it's hard to attribute as the stock continued its slide in the mass energy selloff. 

After releasing it's 2018 guidance in December, CVE gained ~30% before giving it all back due to the systemic energy selloff. 

CVE trades at a FY P/E of 9.6x and a 0.8x FY P/B. It also pays a $0.20 dividend, making a current dividend yield of 2.6%.

CVE has beaten earnings expectations for four straights quarters.

The consensus price target (per MarketBeat) is $15.10, with PT of:

BofA Merrill Lynch: $12.50 

CFRA: $13

Morningstar:$16

Using the lowest PT ($12.50) would represent ~65% return from the current price.

I then choose to invest that money promoting growth in a company that will pay people salaries, which are taxed. The company also pays taxes themselves. Their customers pay taxes for buying goods from them in sales tax.

Investing is inherently risky, i might lose money. The gov doesnt tax my losses, but  does tax my gains.

If i invest for a shorter period of time, they tax me significantly more.

*How many fucking times do they need to tax the same money?*

EmperorOfCanada;1518469207;7x3z1k;;8;;14;"In Canada we have a coffee shop chain called Tim Horton's owned by the same people who own burger king. You can pretty much throw a ball from one tim hortons to another. To put their numbers in perspective Canada has the roughly same population as California. There are 4600 Tim Horton's in Canada That is more than one per 8000 residents. Dunken Donuts has a bit more than double that number in a country 10 times our size.

Over the last decade Tim Hortons has done a large number of things to erode the love of Canadians including:

* Not baking the donuts locally but making them in Ontario (a province every other province hates)
* The above made their product worse.
* Hiring temporary foreign workers, which basically means importing slaves and not hiring minimum wage people like students.
* Having the slowest and ever slower service
* Reducing the quality of their coffee.
* Selling a Canadian company to an American one but keeping up the pretense that they are part of the Canadian identity.

But recently they crossed a line when they screwed over their workers in one province where minimum wage went up.

This last one got Canadians heatedly talking about the list above. The result is that people are actively boycotting the chain and generally discovering that other companies do the same thing better and cheaper.

So, looking at my office. I just don't see TH coffee cups anymore. I see McDonald's and A&amp;W amongst others. I do hear people vowing never to go back. I don't think this trend is going to reverse, people have moved on. I also don't think that there is anything TH can do about it. They have evolved a business model of cutting all the corners. They can't put them back without incurring instant costs that don't translate to instant returns of their former customers.

So my WSB is that QSR is going to start showing all kinds of drops in every measure they have, same store sales, stores opening, etc.

As for the Burger King part of the empire.  I don't see that as making up for the slack.

Also Wendy's and TH did a weird merger years ago that just fell apart.

Why you should invest in Western Union? I don't have that much time on my hands but here are few reasons why you should (it's explained pretty quickly but it's free so stfu) :

- Their revenue didn't move. It can be good (if it's an established company that has stable income) or bad (if the company is yound and is supposed to expand) but in this case, it's good since it's an already established company!

- Their expenses are stable too. This is ok : I would prefer that they had more expenses to show they're trying new things but no rise in expenses is good too.

- Income taxes is decreasing. This is a good thing. Optimizing their taxes! Good for an already established company that don't really need to expand, not good for a young company.

- This point is more of a market psychology. Everything is down. A slight hope in a company and people will throw a lot of money in it to hope for gains.

- We can see that the net income has decreased dramatically showing they now know how to manage their money.

Right now my plan is to wait for the next run up to $35 in about 1-2 weeks time then short TWTR, with an exit price around $28.50, about 1-2 weeks later.

The data of how much margin being used is available. I'm guessing you could probably model where you think it's likely being deployed as well. With that information, the ML algos could easily start predicting at what level of price drops would start causing margin calls. Once margin starts being called, the prices will automatically continue dropping more without manipulation due to the number of autistics without diverse funds.    
    
The best part is that this doesn't even take some super smart guy to figure out this model himself. Instead they're teaching the algos to figure it out, which means it's pretty damn likely they've already deployed these drivers if it's possible. Just wait for some natural event to likely start a drop, then drive it further, then rake in the cash. Think about it; someone was on the other side of all the volatility turds, and made some serious bank.    
    
TL,DR: This drop likely wasn't an accident, and neither was the margin calls.";;Why I think margin traders are really in trouble;

I’ve literally done this over and over again, starting from nothing and gone up but end up getting greedy eventually and keep chasing for more.

One thing i can’t seem to handle is letting winners run, I made good money but I literally could’ve made 3-5x more had I just held on to them.

Like that euro trade, closed for 7k, a couple hours later could’ve made an extra 15-20k on it for a total of about 25k, double the weekly profit.

I know it might just be a matter of “grab your balls and do it”, although that’s hard with emotions etc, but does anyone have any advice on handling this?

Edit: this is a good performance for me but looking at hindsight , had I stuck to my original plan and kept trades going for their “targets” the same way I let them go for “stops”, the 22k would’ve been at least 50k+ ... **that thought kills me**";;Making Obscene amounts of Money but need help;

Seeing all these happy couples partaking in consumerism at it's finest masquerading as a day in which we all profess our love for each other brazenly.. I want to short Valentines day.

My strategy will be echo Bill Ackman's strategy with Herbal Life, but it will work, because I have something Ackman didn't have; Wall Street Bets. 

Here's the plan boys. We pour all of our money into Monsanto. Yes, you read it right. Monsanto.

Once we own enough shares of Monsanto, we take control of the board and fire everyone, effectively making ourselves the prime decision makers of the company. 

We then force Monsanto scientists and engineers to develop a GM crop (lets call it soy) that mimics estrogen and inhibits testosterone production. Next, we sell it to every food product company across the country as an emulsifier so that 90% of the packaged food in the country contains our soy product. 

The next stage unfolds on it's own. Boom. Frogs and other wildlife across the nation become androgynous. Men across the nation lose interest in women at alarming rates since they are essentially now androgynous soy boys. Due to dank levels of estrogen, women start becoming lesbians. In combination, we effectively witness the end of the era of heterosexual relationships. Due to some fluke, about 10% of the population will not respond to our soy products, so we will have to pacify them by creating a VR experience in which they can bed Taylor Swift every night in the oculus rift. 

And just like that, our puts on valentines day soar. Activist Investment at it's best. Bill Ackman will look like our little brother. George Soros will look like he just got done wiping off his titty milk moustache.

TradyMcTradeface;1518747055;7xvk96;;51;;60;"I was watching some financial news today and came across a strategy used by a hedge fund that I hadn't thought of before and I think is brilliant.

Wanted to share with you faggots.

MU has been trading sideways since December 2017 with a good support level around 39. You fags keep trying to buy calls and keep losing money. Now, I am expecting that it will go to 50 before or after earnings but looking at the probability calculator, it is unlikely. I wouldn't mind buying MU around 38-39 price range since it has good support but right now at 43.50 its too risky for me to buy.

The solution is to sell an April 20 38 PUT for credit 1.20 while at the same time open a vertical call spread with same expiry. Total is as follows

Sell April 20 38 put for credit of 1.32

Buy April 20 45 call for debit of 2.70

Sell April 20 50 call for credit of 1.23

In this case, the total debit I paid was 2.7 - (1.32 + 1.23) = .15

The P/L looks like this:

https://i.imgur.com/Dprt8Fm.png

From the P/L you can see 3 things:

The probability of being assigned is ~~0~~ 25%.
If I don't get assigned the most I can lose is .15.
If I am right, the profit is 5.
Anyway, I think this is a good strategy for stock you want to buy at a discount anyway and aren't afraid to be assigned.

Now go make money with MU. ";;I'm going to tech you how to actually make money with MU.;

Overall my plan is to add on dips if I can find my balls again. I missed the choo choo train at 2690 this morning because I was looking at CL. Shorting that now as a sort of semi-hedge but it's only a fraction of my ES position.

How does the execution work when there are multi legs?  It seems if I split the bid and ask for both legs, it would fill them at different times, or possibly one leg and not the other.  Although my gut tells me that's not likely.  Especially when traders have 3 or maybe even 4 legs.

Pinze;1518796521;7xzmou;;55;;224;"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand advanced micro devices. The movement is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of online finance articles,  most of the money will fly right out of a typical investor's wallet. There’s also Su Bae's opportunistic scheming, which is deftly woven into its monetization- its corporate philosophy draws heavily from Hobbesian literature, for instance. The real investors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate Zen based cpus, to realize that they’re not just looking at your typical indicators on a real time basis- they find something deep about the bag holding that is compelling, rewarding, and OF COURSE attainable via going long.

As a consequence, autists who dislike AMD truly ARE faggots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Su Bae's existential catchphrase “RYZEN™ POWERS. RADEON™ REIGNS. YOU PREVAIL.” which itself is an ironic reference to Adam Smith's ""The Wealth of Nations"". I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated speculative traders providing candid feedback in earnest as AMD’s stock collapses on itself on their Robinhood screens. What autists.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Robinhood gold. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the bagholders eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within -20k margin of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel faggot 😎";;To be fair to AMD;

itschrisolson;1518902506;7y9jy4;;10;;7;"**What is Arista?**

Arista Networks is a classic disruptor that has almost everything going right for it these days. Arista's cloud-based networking technology beats traditional hardware in both speed and capacity, and the world's increasing appetite for data helped the company increase revenue more than tenfold over the past six years. Arista's third-quarter report was more of the same: Sales grew more than 50% and net income more than doubled. Fourth-quarter results come out in two weeks, and management has guided for continued growth, with the top line expected to increase about 40% over last year. And about Arista's leadership: It's top-notch. Co-founder and chairman Andy Bechtolsheim is a Silicon Valley legend, founding Sun Microsystems and funding Google in its infancy. CEO Jayshree Ullal and co-founder and chief technology officer Kenneth Duda are superstars in their own right. What's more, Bechtolsheim and Ullal control about 23% of shares between them. Plug in for a long run with this innovator.

Arista Networks' fourth-quarter results continued its impressive run of growth. Revenue jumped 43% to $467.9 million, and that was slightly higher than the consensus forecast among investors for $463 million in sales. Adjusted net income soared 77% to $137.3 million, and the resulting adjusted earnings of $1.71 per share topped the $1.42 per share that most of those following the stock had expected to see.
Sales gains were well balanced across Arista's segments, with product sales jumping 41% even as the smaller but still important services division experienced stronger growth of more than 55%. Internal efficiency remained strong, with gross margin rising another 1.5 percentage points to 65.9%.

As we've seen before, Arista kept a tight rein on most of its expenses. Research and development costs jumped by half, but a decline in overhead expenses and just slight increases in sales and marketing costs helped keep operating expenses in line. That in turn helped to boost Arista's earnings by a greater percentage than its revenue gains.

CEO Jayshree Ullal was very happy with the way that the year ended. ""2017 represents a market tipping point,"" Ullal said, ""with Arista's disruptive software-driven architecture gaining mainstream acceptance as we surpassed 15 million cumulative ports of cloud networking."" CFO Ita Brennan pointed to 2017's 46% revenue jump and 70% rise in adjusted earnings per share as further marks of success for the year.

**Arista CAN keep growing:**

Arista's future remains bright. One reason why Arista had such a strong year was that business from key customer Microsoft grew even faster than the company had expected. Microsoft made up about 16% of Arista's business, and Ullal pointed both to Microsoft's own success with Azure and to Arista's Microsoft engineering team in developing use cases that appealed to users of the systems. Such collaborations with what the CEO called ""cloud titans"" will be a top priority in driving Arista's future growth.

2018 promises to be an interesting year for Arista. The company expects to enter into the 400 gigabit Ethernet market space in the coming year, and after having reached the status of market share leader in the 100 gigabit Ethernet switching industry, Arista can expect to lever its reputation among purchasers to work more closely with service providers, cloud specialty providers, and enterprise customers more broadly.

Arista's first-quarter guidance was generally in line with what investors had foreseen. A range of $450 million to $468 million in revenue was in line with the consensus forecast for $458 million, and guidance for adjusted gross margin of 63% to 65% and operating margin of 32% was generally consistent with past quarters.

Yet shareholders wanted more from Arista, perhaps through stronger projections for 2018 or further signs of accelerating growth in key product areas. In response to that disappointment, the stock dropped 13% in pre-market trading Friday following the Thursday afternoon announcement. In the long run, though, Arista Networks seems to be doing everything it can to capture a growing piece of the important networking space. Long-term investors might well see any pullback for the stock as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern.

**Why I’m still VERY bullish on Arista:**

It shouldn't be surprising that growth will moderate as Arista builds from its larger base. Of course, investors should also keep in mind that Arista has made a habit of underpromising and overdelivering, so I won't be surprised if this outlook proves conservative when 2018 is said and done. But it also didn't help that Arista Networks' stock price had more than tripled over the past year leading up to this report, likely tempting some skittish investors to take profits despite the continued relative strength of Arista's underlying business.

This was another strong report from Arista Networks, and contrary to what Friday's decline might indicate, long-term investors should be more than pleased with their position.

Disclosure: I am now long with roughly $3700 in Arista. Looking for exit at $305. Will add 50% more to position if drops to $238.75

Dancetrooper;1518977686;7yg1j5;;11;;43;"Snapchat update is horrible. Snapchat is losing users. This is probably intentional so they can inflate their market cap as high possible before they all get out and destroy their app altogether.

Snapchat loses money per user. Less users = less money lost = higher stock price.

The only way to make money on SNAP is to long.

Alternatively, we get millions of users to constantly send videos back and forth to each other 12-16 hours per day and watch the DailyMail story over and over, forcing them to lose more money. This would obviously need to be a large-scale operation and we can't do it between 3 of us faggots. But I don't have any confidence at all in organizing something of this scale so you'll probably all just lose money with your puts.

I started day trading with robinhood a few weeks ago and have amassed 100$ return by basically day trading aapl when it moves a fraction of a percent. Then I saw somewhere here something about OLED and went all in and the value went up but then down on Friday and I'm down like 50$. Tuesday is earnings for HD and Dominoes. I'd like to YOLO those stocks but my money is tied up in OLED. Should I wait for OLED earnings on Thursday or sell on Monday or something and possibly take a loss and go all in on these other two stocks.;;Went all in on OLED before the drop...

3. US military are preparing for a war with North Korea and Russia. Military is actually changing camo for prep.

4. School walkouts are being staged already for a gun control push. With Vegas and now this, seems like a matter of time before AR 15S are already hindered with serious restrictions to buy one

2. I can short selling and trade on margin.
3. I can potentially open more than one accounts.

The goal is to maximize the Shape ratio: http://www.stocktrak.com/pdf/ST_Sharpe_Ratio_3perc.pdf. The top 3 (out of around 80 students) would be the winners, so maybe I shouldn't use some strategy that is hyper risky.

This is my first class in finance and I have no prior knowledge about trading. Let me know if you need more information. I did some Google search and found https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/16w9h3/just_started_the_stock_trak_program_in_my/ and http://education.howthemarketworks.com/news/easiest-way-to-win-a-virtual-trading-game/ helpful. But it seems that their goal is to maximize the return instead of the Shape ratio. And therefore the suggested strategy is to invest in hyper risky securities like 3xETF and futures.

Also, I'm wondering if the 3rd condition (creating more accounts) would introduce any arbitrage strategy? The cost to open a new account is less than the prize.";;I kniw this might not be the best place to ask but... what would be the best strategy to win on our house StockTrack competition?;

cocaobeans;1519140570;7ywpnv;;41;;56;"Alright bagholders. Albertsons is gonna come and save you. Here are the terms of the deal.


1. You get $1.85 for every 10 shares (ouch)


2. In addition for every 10 RAD share, you get 1 share of Albertsons.


3. Or you might get 1.079 shares of Albertsons for every 10 shares of Rite Aid. It depends on how some meeting goes.


Well you might ask, how much is a share of Albertsons? Well we know that the difference between the two deals is 0.079, so that means 0.079 shares of Albertsons is worth about $1.85 so about $23 a share. So if my math is correct, does that mean that RAD is being bought out at around $2.4~2.5 a share?

Last year there was a possible Sprint merger and I think we could see continued consolidating in the industry through heavy M&amp;A. Companies like cricket and boost have limited tangible assets and could be easily taken over with a debt offer that is in line with conditions we've seen in the past 24 months. 
VZ is a Buffett class stock that's a huge part of the American economy. Telecoms are something the world will never live without and there will be limited disruption in the industry in the next 10 years.

InterestingNews1;1519326197;7zhdnl;;7;;0;"The robots are taking over and companies are looking to automate their production.  From Apple to Fedex the role of robots is widening as companies seek to realise lower costs.  

Key to expanding this broadening range of industrial tasks is machine vision.  Cognex, a pioneer of machine vision since the 1980s, is a manufacturer of machine vision systems used to inspect and identify parts, detect defects, verify product assembly, and guide assembly robots.

It has seen huge growth with revenues and earnings more than doubling since 2013. 

Q3 was another fantastic quarter with revenues up 39% at $180 million.  The bottom line was a loss as the company invested heavily in R&amp;D and increasing its sales force for future growth but with adjustments net income increased 46% to $56million.

U.S. industrial production is trending upwards strongly and confidence is increasing which is all positive for spending by U.S. manufacturers on factory automation.

The total addressable market is huge with potential appliances in production lines from auto manufacturing to life sciences as well as logistics and even smart phones.

Priced on a multiple of 40 times current year estimates Cognex isnt cheap but, given its execution and outlook, it looks well worth it.

personally, i see the bond bull market over and a multi-year bond bear market in the beginning stages if the federal reserve doesn't begin another decade of quantitative easing. Thought i would see if anyone else is short the reits?

Jowemaha;1519357471;7zl47p;;20;;7;"Here at WSB, we're always chasing that next hit secular growth story. Well, the answer to the question you didn't ask is **food delivery.** In 2017, it grew 50% with no signs of slowing down. The more food is delivered, the cheaper delivery becomes, the more people use it, etc. It's the Amazon flywheel all over again. 

The question becomes: How to benefit from this trend? I think this is fantastic for the fast food giants that didn't have delivery before. MCD, YUM, QSR, all of which are primed to pump food out at volume and trade at very reasonable valuations. Delivery was a huge boon to the pizza industry, and it will be an even bigger boon to fast food companies that can grow without doing an ounce of CapEx to build out a delivery network. I think going long these companies is the best play in this space, since there is almost no downside at these valuations, and vast upside. I'm especially bullish on MCD since they have been killing it by every single metric.

The other compelling play is to long GRUB. These guys have been growing at 30%, just posted monstrously good user growth numbers(77% increase!!), and also signed a deal with YUM, which is obviously a huge deal. I think GRUB is fantastic and going to grow. According to McKinsey, 80% of users who sign up with a delivery app stick with it, and this creates very important winner-take-all effects. UberEats has become a very strong competitor, but it does not appear to be stopping GRUB.";;Let's talk food delivery;

*bolded are the memes*



1ST: **JD**

2ND: INTC

3RD: **MU**

4: **SQ**

5: MTCH

.

.

6th: **AMD**


The motto of the week was ""no child left behind,"" as MU, INTC, and SQ raced neck and neck battling each other for the silver and bronze and papa Qiangdong stood steady at the helm of his ship, the *SS JD*. 

As the market whiplashed all week, MU steadily drove ahead, passing by carcasses of resistances of past at 44,45,46 to close the week strongly entrenched in the high 46s. 

SQ entered the week with strength, hitting the mid 46s before tumbling the remainder of the week and closing a stagnant flat af overall week. They report on Tuesday 2/27, and this may jump them into anywhere on the leadership board except for behind the Queen of retards herself, SuBae. 

INTC too, like its sibling MU, took a late midweek shit before jumping out of the gates Friday and closing in on JD. Look out JD! Intel is closing in quickly. Maybe someone can fuck up another one of their products and report it to google so MU jumps into second.   

I regret not getting in on MTCH and looking at their chart gets me pissed so I have nothing to say about them. Way back at 41 though. 

AMD was pretty much whatever this week. As whatever as they've been in the past year, tbh. No one gives a shit and they prob won't even get a participation ribbon. 

Look for the following update next friday, or if someone wins before then, idk. 

Does China win the gold? Or does the US come back with a steath victory?

So here are my ideas take a good listen:

1. Don’t diversify: Diversifying stops you from making the most possible money. Go all in on every buy. That’s the best way to make money

2. Leveraged ETFs are the only stock to buy. If you want to gain make sure you get something that is really gonna go up. Why make 3000 when you can make 9000? Also buy SVXY. Trust me. Shit is going up for ever. 

3. Actually just trade futures and options. High risk/ high reward. Fuck that other weak shit. 

4. Buy on Margin. You only have to pay it back if you lose a bet. Just don’t lose and you don’t have to worry! 

5.  Don’t plan on when to sell. You might be tempted to set a Stop Loss 5-10% below your buy in. It’s better to just watch the market and sell as soon as the stock has a red day. Make sure you sell as soon as you feel a little anxious. Your emotions will never lie to you

stevebmmm;1519662281;80e7x2;;366;;5465;"TLDR: Bought ~$100,000 of SPX calls late November through December betting the whole market would go up fast in Q1. It did, and I was able to sell a bunch before February came and wiped out the value of the remaining options (*As I've said before, options trading is extremely risky and buying out-of-the-money options even more so). [Total profit, ~$2,500,000](https://ibb.co/gk0bax).

Many of you know I was posting about $100k in SPX calls back in December and then January when the value started taking off. Figured I owed you an update.

Why I bought a crazy amount of SPX calls:
Congress passed a bill slashing corporate tax rates in December. The last time corporate taxes were reduced so much was back in 1986. So I looked at how the market reacted at the beginning of 1987 and saw a huge spike in the S&amp;P 500 in the first quarter.

I wanted to bet the market would react in a similar fashion. I looked through various strike prices in Jan-Mar and modeled which ones would have the highest payouts if Jan 2018 was a repeat of Jan 1987. I also ran a few more conservative scenarios and bought options at those inflection points as well. Many of these options were so far out of the money at the time they were selling for under a dollar. With volatility so low a melt up wasn’t being priced in at all so I put in every dollar I was comfortable losing.

January turned out to be the best first month of the year for the market in more than two decades. The value of the options skyrocketed, some by as much as 5000%. 

I was excited and terrified for the same reasons I bought options and not futures or heavily margined shares in the first place. Going back to 1987, there was eventually a large crash (Black Monday) that wiped out most of the gains for that year. I also knew we were currently going through one of the largest stretches of market history without a substantial pullback. I was pretty sure the market was going to go up and fast, but it was like a game of hot potato to lock in gains before a major correction happened. 

With that in mind I actively sold off chunks of the investment as it went up in January. Since I didn’t know if or when a correction would happen, I wanted to make sure I locked in as much profit as possible.

I was still holding the bag on a bunch of these options when Feb came and wiped them out, taking a large amount of paper gains with them. Another green week and I definitely would have been into yacht-money territory with this trade.

Still, I’d managed to sell enough in January to lock in two and a half million dollars from a $100k investment.

Aside from NVDA leaps I picked up last year and stocks I plan on holding indefinitely, I'm currently mostly in cash waiting to figure out the next move.

I know it's not always a sure thing, but my way seems to not work so well.

badtradesguy;1519707715;80jsw6;;54;;9;"Okay, 

I am always skeptical, but, using optionsprofitcalculator.com you can see an approximate of what you can expect in profit when trading SPX options and if you're buying 10% OTM short term, &lt;3 to 4 months, you can have 1000% gains also. Still not sure how he has 2500% though.

Anyway, If I am correct in what this guy did is, he more or less went 10% OTM with a 4 month time frame. That's really the only way you're going to see this type of return and the return on these ones is only 1000% . So, I'm not really sure how he made twice that.  Give him benefit of the doubt, unless he cares to share. I'll just assume he was able to do this because of low implied volatility.

Using this calculator 
http://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html

Lets say he started in November and bought January 31, 10% OTM calls. He'd be paying between $3.00 to $6.00 per contract.  Option prices are priced pretty fairly.

For calculation, lets use what they have as the mid of the bid/ask $3.70 . The range today is 3.70 to 4.30

This would give you the following:

*  SPX @ 2779
* 10% @ 3056
* 270 contracts 
* 4.5 to 5 month expiration. June 15 contracts.
* Total spent: approx. $100,000


The earliest reasonable time you'll hit $1000000 is Between April 16 to April 26 @ 3050. This means it'll have to gain  to 9% in 2.5 months.  approx. 4% per month.

The most probable time  that you'll hit $100000 is end of May if the market averages 2.75% per month.

The latest time you can cash out as a millionaire is at the end and only if the SPX hits $3120, a gain of 12%.

Now, lets say IV affects option prices by lowering the price by half.

You'd get these contracts for around 1.85 to 1.90

The earliest you'd get to cash at as a millionaire is after 1.5 months with the SPX being required to gain 6%. 

The most reasonable/probably time you'd be able to cash out as a millionaire is May 1, with the spx being required to gain around 2% per month.

** CONCLUSION ** And plot twist.

The market must gain between approx 2.25 - 3% per month in 3 months out of a 4 month expiration  OR in 4 months out of 5 months expiration and you must be paying at maximum 3.70 per contract in order to hit that 1000% within the 3 month time frame and the 10% OTM contract. To hit that 2500% you need to be able to buy these options at 50% of the price. 
 
 Based on what he said is, he started buying in November and sold sometime in January. This meant:

* 4 month time frame
* Had to have bought at around 2600 all of them beginning of November.
* Bought them at 10% OTM 2860 strikes
* Market gained 10.7% in 2.5 months.
* ALL contracts had to have been &lt;$2.40 . 

This gets you 2000% return.  

Now maybe this guy is lucky, but in my research, even using the JUNE 15, 2018 calls which is as close as it gets. The lowest these contracts dropped was to $2.40 and that was with that small correction.  

Even if you use a $2.00 price per contract, the earliest you can get to 2500% is 2.5 months of a 4 month expiration. If the market gains 9 to 10% in that time frame.

If you do a 15% OTM option because they are half the price @ $1.00 per contraction, the only way you'd hit 1000% is if you hit 8% in less than one month.

Eh, based on this, I don't know how this dude did 2500%, but I'd like to see what strike, expiration, and when he bought the entire lot with the 100k.

 Maybe I am missing something? But what do I know, I am not a millionaire.

Its not impossible to hit that Millionaire status with 100k. You'd have to be 10% OTM and have the market gain 9% in 3 months of a 4 month expiration or 2.5% per month in 4 months of a 5 month expiration. This will just give the approximate 1000%.


Good luck all!

I sell a March 2 put spread 240 and 237.5. This means that if $NVDA stays above 240 I get to keep the money that I collected from selling the put spread. 

IF I do this every week with 66% chance of profit that means that every 2 out of 3 times I will make money so in the long run this might be a profitable strategy especially because $NVDA will be $348 next year according to u/TygerWithAWhy

Jowemaha;1519764335;80pxlv;;19;;3;"Gamestop trades at **4x** forward earnings(less than 5x EV/EBIT) and pays a fully supported dividend of **9.5%.**(it goes ex-div in two days BTW). I know it's a dying company, but these numbers are too good to pass up. Positive trends in the underlying business, namely nintendo switch-driven foot traffic will allow for earnings growth in 2018, and updated guidance from tax reform will be the catalyst to create a short squeeze from earnings in about a month. Remember how retail popped like 20% after tax reform? GME is the forgotten hero of retail.

GME is a dying business, but it's just not dying that fast. You can compare it to Sear's, seeing consistent double digit sales declines. GME on the other hand saw sales growth in 2017, largely from their-low margin hardware business, but also from new release games, collectibles, digital sales, game accessories, etc. that have more than offset the decline in the used game business, which by the way is dying, but at a relatively healthy single-digit percentage pace. MSFT is doing some cool backwards compatibility stuff with the Xbox One Plus that allow old games to be played with modern graphics and this could stem the decline of Gamestop's used game business. GME also has an AT&amp;T-branded store business which is nothing interesting and probably was a bad acquisition, but it earns money and leverages SG&amp;A.

Management has done an amazing job of sticking around in a dying business. There's a new CEO because the old one is in the hospital, which is too bad and hopefully he can recover and lead GME to the new golden age.

Taking all of these factors into consideration, we see that GME has limited downside and infinite upside.";;$GME rocket ship is getting ready to fuel up;

sunfrost;1519839249;80xuk7;Stocks;6;;5;"Earnings TODAY after the close (Feb 28 2018)

KXS – Kinaxis

Business – IT company providing supply chain management software. 

Market Cap ~2B CAD

Price - $86.80
52 week high - $91.98  (May 30 2017)

Rationale:

1.    Strong 3 year growth trend

2.    Recent contract with Toyota (January 2018) – contract is to replace all of Toyota’s existing supply chain management software with Kinaxis’ software.  This wont be in earnings, but gives their software a quality stamp of approval.

3.    Average analyst price target is 91.50

4.    Earnings today after the close,  EPS forecast seems reasonable to be beaten

 

Exit:

1.    This is an earnings play.  If they beat today, you should see a pop on Thursday and continued rally.

2.    If they miss today or guidance is poor, I would exit on Thursday’s open.

3.    So there is no stop loss for today.  Thursday will tell you the outcome.


Edit - 
Results - Adjusted EPS $0.30/share.  
Estimate - 0.28

Forward guidance has 20% revenue growth. Looks pretty good. ";;Snow mexican stock tip - TSE:KXS - Kinaxis Inc.;

Promech;1519898954;8148go;;26;;2;"Disclaimer: I’m not new to stock trading, but I’ve always done it via reading something and making a bet and overall it’s resulted in some profit but nothing major. 

I was at one of those “millionaire habits” presentation(mainly because I had the day off and figured I wouldn’t lose anything by just listening to it) and what it ended up being was about stocks. They explained put options, call options, straddles, Etc. 

Now their selling point was a training session and with that training session they would give you access to their stock software. From what the person explained the program basically analyzed everything for you, and then he went on to explain how the charts the program does works. 

Basically 2 lines, one is a 15day price average the other is a 50 day price average, and when the 15 day average is higher than the 50 day one that’s when you should buy. When they intersect again and the 50 day is higher again then you should sell. 

My questions are the following:

1- is this basically how most of these programs work? 

2- is that a viable/proven way of determining to buy/sell stock? Like when the 15 day line crosses over is it always going to be a buy because it’s making money or does it just zig zag and then the example they gave us was just a very obvious one? 

3- if this is not the way others work/if it’s not viable, what is the more viable way of analyzing and projecting stock data?

4- what are programs you guys use(if any), what is the price, and why do you use that one vs another one? What is the average success using the program you use?";;Stock software question;

I'd long suspected that something was rotten in the state of advertising. Everybody touts the value of companies like Snapchat based on ""oh, they have so much *data*, they can *target ads* to people, it'll *change the world*."" Despite all this, nobody's ever proffered any evidence that it actually works. How often do these targeted, smart ads actually lead to sales conversions? What's the ROI?

Gambled4MyRangeRover;1519954132;81ande;;1;;0;"Rule #1 - Never get greedy!

Anyone that bought AMC calls low and sold when it doubled made it out like bandits. Shoutout to the scrub that accused me of Dunning Kruger. Dude, being happy about a huge gain isn't DK syndrome GTFO.

Next move - Barnes and Noble. We all knew it would miss, but those of us that don't like being IV crushed bought puts and sold before the conference call. I personally got in (3/16 5.00 Put) at .6 and out at .8 -- some did better but fuck it 33% is 33%.

Next - Costco. I picked up some 3/9 195 Calls. Going to do a premium play here. AKA dump these before earnings or 50% gain - whichever comes first. Either way should be in the green IMO. 

[Sales trends](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/is-costco-cost-set-to-beat-earnings-estimates-cm929014) overwhelmingly favor a beat. This matters for different reasons though, since the plan isn't to hold through earnings. Positive sentiment (+ a slow run-up in the next five trading days) is clearly going to pump up the value of the premiums.

Case in point : a $1.87 haircut down to the high 180s only knocked the call in question down 37 cents. Options traders clearly agree COST is in good position with its sales and guidance (they selling cars now wtf?)

I don't feel like getting gangbanged by IV, so I wouldn't hold through earnings, but this is clearly a nice premiums play for novice traders like me.

COST 3/9 $195 Calls to the moon. Currrently $2.23 - consider the boat missed if you can't get in before $2.50. If you can, free money IMO.

I've been thinking of selling covered calls on AAPL, BABA, NVDA, BA and other stocks that have been hit pretty hard by last months correction. I'm also pretty sure I'll do covered calls on SPY.

I wouldn't mind holding any of these positions and it fits pretty well with my goals of making a few hundred bucks a week.

What are your experiences with selling covered calls? Is it worth it for the amount of capital I'll be tying up? If buying index funds is the best way to profit according to Papa Buffet, wouldn't covered calls be an excellent way to take advantage of holding SPY? ";;Covered calls;

Personally I think UPS probably has the most upside due to the overblown Amazon threat, Amazon makes up about 7% of their top line revenue with razor thin margins. Shipping with Amazon will still be in beta for quite some time until amazon develops the infrastructure to be able to ship majority of their products and until then they're still heavily dependent on USPS, FDX and UPS. 

Walmart is were all the poor people shop, I think they noted that their online sales makes up less than 5% of their total revenue meanwhile their same-store growth has increased.

Lolsmileyface13;1520026305;81iixs;;32;;55;"What an exciting week! Full of lead changes, and some surprising twists. 

EOW Standings 

1ST: MU

2ND: SQ

3RD: JD

4: Roku

[This week's close](https://imgur.com/a/qVkN5)

[Last week's close](https://imgur.com/a/fN74P#iTwBgNc)

JD. Mothafuckin, ""untouchable"" JD. Not one green day this week, as it plummeted as low as 15% this week before stabilizing at -10% as CEO Liu bent over for Papa Ma, as disclosed in the sexual assault SEC filing it shared with investors. Closing the week at a very distant $43.78. 

SQ whiplashed left and right, holding third until JD tanked. Falling to 43 after earnings and then spiking to 48 for like 5 min, SQ ended up stabilizing at 46, where it closed the week. High PE? Perhaps, but who gives a fuck. Stocks only go up, anyways. My barber started taking SQ and he's 85 years old, time to go all in. 

And let's show some love for BIG PAPA SANJAY. MU climbing 5% on the week before tanking on that orange faggot's steel semi-boner and regaining it all at close of week, only 60 cents or so from our prior meme high. MU IS NOW COMFORTABLY IN FIRST. 

The race stalled somewhat this week, but props to MU for staring the red market in the eye and shitting dollar bills throughout (MU's market maker must be colorblind, but we'll let the poor autist believe he earned his position instead of being offered it out of pity - GS already hired the special needs quants and they had a quota to fill). 

Per last week's popular request, ROKU has been added to the meme race. IDK why the fuck why, because the tards who voted to add roku as a late entry last week (I'm looking at you u/avgazn247 &amp; u/Brunoob) must have been looking at its chart upside down. Down 10% this week and rumor has it the new Roku Premiere+ will come packaged with dildos so they can continue fucking themselves.  

INTC has been dropped as it isn't a meme stock and technically  already won. Who the fuck wants to watch Usain race a group of quadriplegics? (lowkey I would anyways..... I'll take the 1:10000000 odds on Stephen Hawking in case Bolt sprains his ankle)

Last I heard, AMD was giving Kimmy Jong Un's little pencil wiwi a blowy in the stadium bathroom but it may have been a north korean choir boy, idk they all have the same haircut. 

All in all, an interesting week. My account closed up $144, a staggering 0.31% , holding a weak AB (Ally Bank) Coefficient of 0.20 (0.3% / 1.5%). Mostly because I sold some SQ on the dip and then bought JD right before they tanked, in typical quant fashion. 

Feel free to share your WSBlympics stories for the week.

After being freshly butt fucked by Powell this week I’m sure you can help me out with this.

I decided to do margin accounts so what better way to discredit margin by citing real life examples from you faggots. The bigger the loss here the better. Answer the following questions so I can get an A in this shitty class.
 
• What percentage of your portfolio is actually cash and how much is margin?
• How much have you paid in margin interest? 
• How much have you lost (total or percentage)  while using a margin account and what is the worst margin maintenance you’ve had? 
• What was the percentage of your net worth did you lose or have to pay as collateral?
• If you didn’t have the cash on hand to deal with the margin maintenance then what extreme circumstances did you have to do to fix it (take out a loan, sell your car, etc.) or have your assets been seized before to pay it off? 

If there are an other interesting stories you have for me then list it. I will even cite you if you’d like. ";;What’re your worst margin stories and how deep in the hole were you?;

Got greedy and bought 3X more puts, but Riot didn't go much past 10 and that wiped out any profits I had from the first trade and then some. 

Bought CMI calls right before all this Tariff nonsense came into the news. 65% loss. Bought puts on Etsy after it spiked and actually was up 50-60% at one point. Still reeling from the CMI disaster I wanted more. Now down 20% with 2 weeks left and  not a lot of hope that Etsy is going to drop below 25 again.

My positions were much to large and there were some other smaller trades I took losses on. All told I slashed about 45% off my 14k account in about 2 weeks.

Cheddar reported that Snap is working on 2 new versions of Spectacles! TWO. Wooo--NO. FUCK YOU. Okay, I get it. No one cares they lost $40 million. BUT They had over 170 million users and only 150,000 Spectacles were sold. I'm not an Asian math wizard but that's ^^calculating... not a lot. NO ONE FUCKING WANTS THIS FUCKING THING.

Spectacles 2.0 is rumored to be released this fall and 3.0 next year.

The first one didn't do shit because it had a terrible fucked up launch. A month of vending machines, then another 4 months for it to sell online, then another 4 for it to reach Europe. IT TOOK FOUR FUCKING MONTHS FOR A FUCKING COMPANY THAT DOES EVERYTHING VIA THE INTERNET TO SELL THEIR ONLY PIECE OF HARDWARE ONLINE!

Okay so this time maybe they'll just release it when it's available everywhere and their online store is ready. Then more people will buy it right?

But what about the SHITTY FUCKING HARDWARE? Not even 1080p, slow as fuck transfer rate, can't export without it turning into a fucking video polka dot, it's literally worse than just USING YOUR FUCKING HANDS TO SHOOT SOMETHING compared to aiming with your FUCKING FACE.

***

1. I have seen some interpret this number as an intentional exaggeration based on the fact that Musk later specified the initiation of deliveries on July 1st as ""an impossible date"". The two factors are easy to separate, though, if you look further down in the transcript. 

 Musk says,  
&gt;  ""I feel confident about the topline number, but the mix internally, it is difficult to figure that out. Maybe it's something like 100,000 to 150,000 S and X, and then maybe 300,000 to 400,000 of 3, I don't know. It's really hard to say."" 

 Musk was obviously incredibly confident in a figure in the ballpark of a third of a million by the end of 2018, so it's reasonable to extrapolate that at the very least, 10% of that should have been done in 2017-even if factoring for the frequently mentioned ""production ramp"", which Tesla can never seem to get a hold of. We'll see if they can find the traction necessary to make it a reality. 

 Tesla has actually been sued [over the matter of failure in Model 3 production readiness](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/31/technology/tesla-shareholder-suit-model-3/index.html). They mentioned it themselves in their [Q3 2017 report](http://ir.tesla.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1564590-17-21343&amp;CIK=1318605): 

 &gt; On October 10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, two of its current officers and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from May 4, 2016 to October 6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made materially false and misleading statements regarding its preparedness to produce Model 3 vehicles. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.

 I haven't seen any update on the case's progress but would update this if anyone has info.

***

***

I'm going to add a component to this which I feel is necessary because oftentimes when I see a post/comment which highlights Tesla's inability to meet goals and/or deadlines, a Tesla fan (or investor) comes forward and questions its significance within the overall market - usually against automotive competitors.

So, I'll compare projections for the Model 3 against the Bolt since those are both in the 200+ mile range EV segment.

I checked various investor materials from both companies' going back into 2012 and coming forward to 2017. In addition, I checked media reports for general events. Here is when each company made projections of availability for the respective segment entry, when revisions occurred, and the actuality:

Note: There were a handful of mentions of the Model 3 in terms of future outlook which dated quite far back. The [Summer 2011 letter](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/6055843436x0x494001/DD297293-EC2D-4DC5-8DB4-63D491FB6BD0/Company_Overview_Q3_2011.pdf) included a mention of the then-called ""Gen III"", but I didn't include them as they were relatively theoretical in manner and not projections in any regard. They actively disclosed the project was on a TBD-basis so I granted them the benefit of said disclosure.

**Phase 1:** With £100,000 of virtual money, using real stock markets, invest in FTSE-100 companies (and 50 others). Top 300 teams in terms of gains go through to the next round. This ended around 15th of January.

**Phase 2:** Every Monday we are given 4 stocks and their price/chart, we have to guess what the price will be on Friday end of trading hours. Closer you are in +-%, the more points you get. This began last week and continues for another month or two.

Basically for round 1 we went all in on these mining companies on 1st of Dec: KAZ, RIO, AAL. And we were in the top 20 of 3000 teams with over £26,000 gains by 15th of January. Lots of other teams followed the markets every day and did lots of research into the best companies, but we hoped that the mining corporations might find like a really big vein of diamond or copper so the share price would go up. Our other theory for why we made decentish gains was because a lot of people will want to buy diamond wedding rings in time for Valentines day (so they would be buying in December/January, raising share prices), and copper piping too I guess.

Please can you give any advice for Phase 2? We are currently in top 40 out of the 300 finalists in phase 2, our strategy so far is that we just looked at the stock charts and extrapolated up/down, I think our best team member has been rounding every closing price to the nearest multiple of 7.

**TL;DR: How do we guess what a share price will be in 5 days, we had some good strategies for round 1 but now we are given stocks to work out the price in exactly 5 days.**";;How do I guess the price a stock will be in a week? Please help us with our economics competition;

QuantalyticsResearch;1520257291;825zl0;;0;;2;"Is it safe to say that the days of record low prices for crude oil are long gone? Production cuts from OPEC have stabilized global crude oil markets ~USD$60/barrel for the short-run.  Now that global crude oil prices are stabilizing, where can investors and traders invest in energy?

Investors may want to consider US E&amp;Ps given that total cash break-even costs for US shale E&amp;Ps are estimated to be ~USD$40/barrel based on internal research at Quantamize. Forward multiple for the US Energy Sector look attractive with the S&amp;P 500 energy sector trading at a Fwd 12M P/E of 15.5x with an expected annual EPS growth rate of 30+% for the next 3-years; this translates to a PEG ratio of 0.5x which means the forward 12-month multiple investors are paying for forward earnings is at a discount to the rate of growth for future earnings. 

Over the past few weeks, Quantamize has highlighted a few attractive options trades in the US energy space: XOP (US E&amp;Ps ETF) Bull Call Spread and a SLB Bull Put spread.  When Quantamize highlighted the Bull SLB Put Spread, 1-month implied volatility for SLB was implying a 5 standard deviation downside move. In comparison, SLB as top name in our US Large-cap Multi-Factor Quant model. 

Investors and traders may want to consider future opportunities in the US energy sector given that valuations remain cheap while the prospects for the sector are improving sequentially.

We're right at the upper resistance level of the bearish trend today. If it shoves up past it, it might be a pretty nice breakout that could swing for a few days. I personally think its more likely we hit 265 on SPY today and retest the lows of the channel.

Either way, be prepared to see 50 percent of your position vanish LITERALLY before you can sell. GL bros and may God be with you. Be patient with your entry points. Sometimes you'll make more money just waiting and trying to pile onto the trend once it really makes its decision for the day. Even then though, it might turn around instantly. 

Edit: I'm looking to short the spy if we get 269ish and will hold a bit past 270 but liquidate at 270.5; taking profits around 265 depending on momentum. If we dont hit it, I probably wont buy puts because they're fucking expensive at the moment. Will buy calls if we get to the 264-265 for a short term bounce but probably will sell half at 266ish and the rest at 267. If we dont hit either of these numbers I'm just watching today.

$NVDA is a gaming company. It has been since its inception. Most recently, Nvidia has been big into Artificial intelligence. Most headlines reference something to do with AI. I think this transition from gaming to AI is important for Nvidia's growth in the next decade. My price target for them is a 40% upside, $329. Is that even possible given how much it's grown this past year? I think so. 


[Here is the google drive with the model paper, and position proof, updated whenever I update them](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h2cTeiNRP07K8-2Wn4lYyQtbB_go2HGB?usp=sharing)


I'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks:


Catalysts


* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.

* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.


Risks:


* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.


* AMD/new GPU designer taking market share from Nvidia. Unlikely, but Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market is why I am so bullish. I want to invest in the leader of AI deep learning training hardware and graphics processing, not the second best.


* Jensen Huang, the CEO, losing his ability to lead the company. Nvidia has has successfully positioned themselves to be a part of the future of AI, which I think is accredited to Huang's execution. This is a positive, he's invested in the company. The downside to this is that he is very important and anything that hurts his ability to lead would hurt Nvidia.


Price Target:


* I used a DCF model to arrive at the price target of $329, using a 7% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate. In the model I assume 39% revenue growth in Nvidia's 2019 fiscal year, 32% in 2020, and 28% in 2021. I based this off their plans in autonomous driving, and their new GeForce series to be released with Volta architecture. 


What I think:


I think Nvidia successfully integrating its hardware into so many big company's is a huge success for their long term goals. Nvidia hardware is being utilized in Tesla's electic car's autopilot 2.0, and used by Google and Amazon Web Services datacenters. Nvidia is so dominant that no one can take these positions unless the company wants to build their own chips, which would be billions of dollars in R&amp;D. Nvidia is supplying hardware for these big companies and there is no one to compete.


I have +1 Jan 19 NVDA $350 Call that I purchased for $8.30. Proof in drive. Why not investing more? I don't want a lot of exposure and I'm poor.


TLDR: NVIDIA is investing into AI. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 operates Tesla's autopilot 2.0 system, Nvidia's new Tesla GPUs have grown datacenter revenue by 133% this last year, and their focus on the narrow AI to bring autonomous vehicles on the road is proving to be worth it. $329, long equity.

JavaValhalla;1520354214;82ges4;;5;;4;"I was skeptical that the market responded so nicely to the NK talk of denuclearization.

The only thing I couldn’t find was the terms that NK would actually denuclearize.

&gt;&gt;“North Korea said there was no need to keep its nuclear program as long as there was no military threat against it and the safety of its regime was secured.”

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/06/us-stock-futures-dow-data-earnings-and-politics-on-the-agenda.html

So NK is essentially saying “we will denuke if the US can remove itself entirely out of the South Pacific.”  Thatll never happen.

I showed them my yolo gains but they always told me to keep up the returns and come back way down the line. My dream never materialized but this week, I did what a faggot should do and bought 76 FD $54.5 03/09 on MU after Papa Trump confirmed during the press meeting that the tariffs are coming. When Mama Cohn resigned, I clenched my butthole tight and prepared to take it in the ass like a faggot that I am. But Mr. Market had other plans for me. MU shot to $55 and I liquidated my FDs.

Now, I dream of being highly leveraged, naked and soaring high off of minimal equity.

crjlsm;1520448226;82qn58;Stocks;8;;10;"So everyone is pretty panicked right now with Cohn resigning and what not. But let's take a look at the past month or so. Earnings for a lot of the giants came out, they're as profitable as ever and that trend looks to continue. Tax reform is giving these companies a big boost for the years to come as well. 

So, keeping that in mind, let's look at what has been thrown at the market so far, and whether or not there was a significant enough reaction to declare we are in bear territory:

Interest rates: no 

Fed chair: no 

VOLpocalypse: no 

Mueller: no 

Tariffs: no 

Cohn: no 

Seeing a pattern here? Sure, we've had some dips. But since vol peaked and we had our correction, we've retraced about 2/3 of the gains that were lost in face of all the stupid shit being thrown at the market. The indices are bending, but they are not in danger of breaking. The reactions are also becoming less exaggerated, and although it's memworthy I think a lot of this shit is simply priced in. The economy is just too strong at the moment to be tanked by steel tariffs or tariffs on whiskey and Harleys. 

All that being said, buy SPXL on the dip eevery time.

A dream of a free Shkreli that would make it rain tendies once free from his shackles of oppression and then it came to me on how we can help Papa Martin out. There is a website that we can petition the whitehouse with whatever problem we have, from SeekingAlpha not eating a shoe to why AMD won’t hit $15. My thought process is that if we reach the requirement of 100,000 signatures in 30 days or get a bigger following perhaps Overlord Trump will maybe eventually look at it and grant him a pardon. Compared to other securities crimes he is a pretty small time offender and Trump probably needs a new economic advisor so this would be Martin’s time to shine. It’s a win win. Shkreli doesn’t deserve all these sentences such with the penalties as giving up the Wu Tang album, essentially the Holy Grail of the rap game, or the assets he has to forfeit. He has helped us and now it is our time to help him.

My theory: the Donald is trying to trim some jobs. Plenty of us faggots got wrecked by the recent correction that was started by inflation fears coming from low unemployment numbers over a long period. 

The number of people working in steel and aluminum production in the United States surely can’t outnumber the people in us industries that benefit from foreign steel and aluminum (auto, beer, manufacturing etc.). While producers might see benefit, American consumers of steel and aluminum could be hit hard resulting in possible layoffs and wage drops. There, the supreme commander of the bull market has staved off inflation fears without rate hikes.

itschrisolson;1520480392;82ujeq;;1;;3;"**Why Do I Like Varonis Systems?**

Just about everybody knows how valuable personal and business data can be — and that includes the people who have access to it. While the cybersecurity discussion usually focuses on defense against outside attackers, businesses can face threats from within, too, as bad actors use sensitive information for their own gain. This is the niche served by Varonis Systems (NASDAQ: VRNS). While Varonis is a small company, its impressive client list shows it can play with the big boys, and I think more outsized gains are ahead.

Varonis' platform looks at how the people and machines that have access to a company's data typically behave. That creates a baseline against which it can compare future activity. If it sees unusual behavior — from data transfer volume to employees who are checking out files they normally wouldn't — then it can alert key personnel.

The comprehensive nature of Varonis' offerings is a big asset. For instance, DatAdvantage helps users understand exactly where their key information is — something that's increasingly complex given the move toward cloud-based data storage and network infrastructure. Meanwhile, DatAlert monitors data access and use, producing behavioral analytics for individuals and the company as a whole that make it easier to detect bad behavior. Varonis can also help prevent unwanted access in the first place by giving employees only the data-access rights they need to do their jobs, limiting the risk of unauthorized activity.

I'll talk about revenue in the next section, but to see how well Varonis is doing, let's start with those customers I mentioned earlier. Varonis added about 900 new clients in 2017, bringing its total to about 6,250. Those customers tend to be loyal — Varonis has a maintenance renewal rate of more than 90% — and more than half have purchased two or more product families. And as I alluded to, it's catering to some big businesses with multifaceted needs. Coca-Cola, SanDisk, and Toyota are just a few of the many large multinational corporations that use Varonis products. But Varonis also serves government entities, educational institutions, hospitals, and industry associations.

While I love cybersecurity as a long-term trend, it's an industry that's always evolving as data thieves up their game to match the latest developments. So I love that Varonis' co-founders are still involved. Yaki Faitelson is CEO, and he has a strong approval rating on Glassdoor. Ohad Korkus is stepping down as chief technology officer (more on that in the next section, too), but he'll remain as a director.

Add it all up, and Varonis is looking strong as it takes on a huge opportunity in a promising field. With the rise of cloud computing and data analytics making raw information more valuable than ever, Varonis stands ready to capitalize on potentially explosive growth as more enterprise customers realize just how much they have on the line.

**See Why You Should Invest in Varonis Systems Now:**

Varonis' growth has been impressive so far: Sales more than doubled between 2014 and 2017, rising by more than 30% last year. Yet with annual revenue of just $217 million, Varonis has barely tapped an addressable market that it estimates to be about $60 billion. I think it has what it takes to grab a bigger chunk of that market. The company is expecting strong growth to continue, with revenue projected to rise 21% to 23% this year — and an adjusted net profit possibly around the corner.

I'm encouraged that Varonis has a few broader trends working in its favor. New regulations stemming from data breaches are likely to force corporate clients to find solutions like the ones Varonis offers. The move toward more cloud-based data storage solutions has required businesses to adopt hybrid security solutions, and Varonis has seen increased interest in solutions that work well with key platforms like Microsoft's  Office 365 and Azure. Malware and ransomware have created new threats, and Varonis has addressed them with its new Edge product, which identifies them and alerts users to their presence.

Varonis isn't without its risks. Much larger competition from cybersecurity experts like Dell, Symantec , and Cisco Systems pose a clear threat, and there are many smaller players vying to provide data protection services to enterprise clients. Yet Varonis' focus on internal threats distinguishes it from its rivals, and its impressive list of high-profile clients demonstrates the value that customers put on its product offerings.

We're also going to keep an eye on the recent change in the C-suite, since founder leadership is one of the reasons we're excited about Varonis. I don't consider it alarming that Korkus  stepped down as CTO (as of March 1), especially since his replacement, David Bass, has been with the company since 2005, a year after its founding. But I'll be checking.

Varonis' stock surged more than 80% in 2017, but that only brought it back to the levels it enjoyed shortly after its initial public offering in 2014. Yet its full potential is a lot clearer now than it was then, and the company has already made impressive strides toward achieving long-term growth. Even around all-time highs, Varonis Systems has the strong growth history, solid business model, impressive operational capabilities, and innovative vision to lead the industry forward.

As seen by the chart below, cybersecurity spending is predicted to double by 2026, and you don't want to miss the train.

clone9786;1520557805;832ssm;;31;;59;"So I lucked out and came across a nice little stock called $RUN or Sunrun, a solar cell company that leases solar cell installations to home to make it easier for residential folk to get into solar energy. I decided to buy into this stock when it was at $6. It quickly grew and peaked (since my buying in) at $7.44 when the earnings report came out. 

They had a pretty rough earnings report and the stock price dropped as a result. However, I believe that this is the perfect opportunity to buy in while its low. 

Firstly, the stock has already started growing back yet again. Secondly, they recently became number one in residential solar in the U.S., passing Tesla's SolarCity. The past two quarters it has passed Tesla in residential sales.

It just announced its expansion into new states, which not only means growth compared to now, but also growth in the future as they continue to expand into more states. It is also good to remember that this was the winter quarter, and it makes perfect sense that solar companies wouldn't do too well in the winter, when the sun is barely out and you can't install in places such as the newly expanded Massachusetts since there is snow on the roofs. Now that we are moving into the spring and summer months, this is the time the company will experience a lot of people installing solar power. 

While Sunrun reported high net loss, they were lower than the previous year as well as almost doubling their net income and increasing their revenue by about $26 million. Since people reacted to the poor earnings report and didn't pay attention to the majority of good news coming out of this company, now is the perfect time to buy into the dip.  Its even been rated as undervalued, for example Credit Suisse set a price target of $15.

I'm running off 39 hours of no sleep and a lot of caffeine, nicotine, and adderall right now, so feel free to chime in about whatever in case I fucked up. And as always, buy $MU and $CRON

EDIT: Forgot to mention that Massachusetts is a meaningful market for them to expand their solar panel and battery business into since it is one of the states with the highest rate of power outages";;$RUN: Why you should buy the dip;

To test this hypothesis I went to google finance, closed my eyes, and started searching for random tickers by mashing my keyboard. 

I ignored any tickers that didn't have any results or weren't traded on a major exchange.

MrTrader I am asking that you reply with the 5 tickers you would like to use as a challenge against these 5. The tickers you choose must be correlated to a bear market because of how strongly you believe we are headed towards one (or in one currently).

GeniusInv;1520570032;8341iy;;40;;19;"So Tesla's chief accounting officer just resigned a few hours ago, which is rather peculiar, and especially at this crucial time. Wrote this on another sub and figured I might aswell post it here too to shill my short position. I suggest buying $100-200 2019/20 puts, I think this is a unique opportunity for a huge return. Here is the thing:

Tesla is objectively in very poor financial health, in constrast to what surprisingly many people seem to think. A good way to determine financial health is looking at working capital, which is a company's current assets (cash and liquid assets) minus current liabilities (bills payable within 12 months), if this figure is not positive the company most likely need a cash injection soon.

Tesla's working capital is negative more than a billion. And not only that they are running an operating loss of several hundred million per quarter (money needed just to keep the lights on). Furthermore they have guided for capex of around $4B this year (investments in Model 3 production equipment primarily, also for Gigafactory and other items). Last quarter they pushed out bills for a temporary cash flow boost, but those will then have to be paid this quarter which is also looking like it will be yet another quarterly loss record.

So adding their operating loss and capex spend they will probably have a negative cash flow of at least $1.5B in Q1, which should take them to a negative working capital of a massive $2.5B.

Due to this I very much expected a capital raise either today or tomorrow as they have raised money every time in the past within 14 days of their latest 8-K filing which was filed 12 days ago. Tesla's CAO leaving abruptly at this crucial time with no successor announced does not look good.

If anyone disagrees on the health of Tesla I challenge you to find any other company with a negative working capital as significant as Tesla that is also cash flow negative. That is a very rare financial situation and suggests a significant bankruptcy risk I think many are not aware of.

We urge you not to take any rash actions or turn towards abuse of drugs or alcohol. 

Please read through this brief list of symptoms to see if you may be experiencing any abnormal reactions:

* Avoiding places, people, situations, feelings, activities and thoughts that remind you of Martin Shkreli.
* Loss of interest in Martin Shkreli in general and his activities.
* Feeling (emotionally) detached and numb (from lack of Martin Shkreli).
* Inability to remember important Martin Shkreli related information.

* Intrusive, upsetting memories of the Martin Shkreli's sentencing.
* Nightmares (of the Feds or of other frightening things).

Noqt;1520632402;83ahjl;;11;;19;"**Fed will hike rates for the next two years until they hit at least 300 bps, because a 300 bps decrease in fed rate will theoretically pull us out of recession**


The dilemma for the Fed is to not cause the recession in the process by raising the rates, but rates weren't hiked immediately after the last recession so now we are playing 'catch-up'. 


The Fed will raise rates in March during their next meeting on the 21st, and the fed fund futures calculator shows something like 90% certainty for it as well. [Target rate probabilities](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html/)


I am 100% certain rates will be hiked because of these reasons:


* CORE PCE Inflation rate has grown and seems to be going toward their 2% target, sitting at 1.5% now. The fed paused last year in September because PCE was at 1.8% in Feb, 2017 and it dropped down to 1.4% in May. Fed will pause if PCE gaps down to 1.4% or 1.3%


* Jobs report for Feb 2018 shows 313K job creation, this locks in a rate hike in March. Jobs monthly report below 75,000 will trigger a pause.


* Stock market isn't in a correction and we are not in a recession, both are conditions for a pause which are not met. So there will be rate hike.


Source? Jim Rickards, reading Yellen speeches, and analyzing the data. 


How do we profit off this? 


Honestly no clue because there's already strong certainty of rate hike, but I bought vix calls just in case. 


Also interesting, the day after the effective rate hike shows almost 50% increase in volume in major indices.

nosenseino;1520645668;83bzeq;;18;;28;"Lately, during the past correction many thought that the correction was the start of a crash, bear market, or whatever your preference to describe it. It caused uncertainty in a lot of investors. The biggest of which, in my opinion are as follows:

* Rising Bond Yields (investors make switch when market volatile = less money in stocks)
* Geopolitical Uncertainty (North Korea, ""Looming"" Trade War)

There were others. Feel free to name them, but I believe these were two biggest ones.

Investors only chose to sell off stocks and buy bonds because of rising fear and uncertainty. But my overall point is that this fear has subsided. Peaceful diplomacy with North Korea, the tariffs having a better impact than a lot of fear-mongering journalists predicted, means that investors will buy more stocks (for the uninitiated, this will cause stocks to rise).

And we have not seen the FULL effect of the GOP tax bill take place yet. When tax time comes, and the vast majority of Americans keep more money, and Publicly traded companies keep more money, we will see the full Bull Market take effect.

I'm 100% certain our Lord and Savior is on the spectrum too. 

Many normies will say he is narcassitic. This very obviously not the case. The most simple and clearest major flaw with this assumption: Narcassists know very well about others emotions and how to take advantgae of them. They know how others feel and they don't care.

Autistic on the other hand, they don't know how others feel, but they do care equally about their well being. Once they find out empathy is needed, they look for a solution. This is evident is the stack of 60 letters the judge reviewed, many attesting to how Martin helped people around him with personal healthcare costs, teaching, and so on. He was closely invested in their well-being. 

A Narcassist wouldn't ever care to genuinely help others. They might think to care, but then they woud take it away if they found out it wasn't serving them well. 

I wish his lawyer realized his autism is his best defense. He bascially has a social learning disorder. While he has a high IQ for certain analysis, he has a low IQ for how to act in the world. 

I feel for our lord and savior. He has been mistreated by society. Even most mental health professionals, and doctors do not understand autism yet. It is young. I hope he enjoys his time of solitude, because he really was one of us. While this is a meme for most, 'one of us' is IRL for the likes of me.

BrutalOn-nesty;1520740589;83kfe1;Fundamentals;5;;8;"Several months ago, Mark forward guidance expected a quintuple in their revenue. The once promising company that failed to delivered has once again revitalize interest with their AI Kankan. They have an incredibly potent AI system, with high hopes expressed by a 16.38% institutional, notably CP group which were the first to enter the China when theey open their market to the world. Now this means nothing but it certainly has the eyes of large investors.

And if you haven't read a few months ago by the redditor that I found out from. https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/7ctau5/you_need_to_check_out_ai_led_remark_holdings_mark/

With the bogus claim that got deleted a few weeks ago, it toppled $MARK price below 10 which should have never happened, it presents an excellent buy a few days ago and is still a perfectly fine time to buy into, with the dip that came this friday and maybe for the next few days but it is expected to break 10 next week. They also have some serious RSI. BUT how the management reacted show some serious weakness in their public relations and management in general but also their CFO sold his positions. Their rebutal was clean and clear but vague. Following the day or two they tried to present old news of being part of the 2017 Deloitte Technology 500 and pathetically saying, ""Excited for what we will do in 2018"" (https://twitter.com/RemarkHoldings/status/969376667905900544). Perhaps this is nothing and because they are a small market cap, they are just simply inexperience with public relations and devoting all their focus towards KanKan while maintaining their other subsidiaries.

The reason why $MARK grew earlier this week (March 6) was the confirm contract with 11,000 7/11 stores in Thailand followed by an paper published by shanghai university. https://twitter.com/RemarkHoldings/status/970994294453604353?s=19

And days before they showed us an example of KanKan (March 2). https://twitter.com/remarkholdings/status/969595666040147970?s=19

On March 8 shanghai uni publish their analysis of KanKan. The paper showed high hopes in not only China but also and just maybe they can enter the Japanese market. Even though Japan is weak economically for growth there is still a market opened for innovation. http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Mf--fg9cQMIJ:www.shtvu.org.cn/_upload/article/files/03/56/60a4c3f846a38e8010aba6ff81c4/30329619-639c-4411-8139-d2445dd9f74c.pdf

Now as for Tariffs, it will not budge Remark but more importantly it will not budge China. It is said that we only get 4-2% of steel from China as of federal information. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/08/angus-king/does-much-steel-does-us-import-china/ But there is worry that it maybe even more than that through transshipping by shipping steel from china to another country before reaching the US as we record that information only but tracking this is incredibly difficult and steel is heavy and expensive (and the supposed reason why china is doing this to curb overproduction and perhaps they are selling at a loss http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36099043) It would most likely affect strain our relations with out allies instead. But more importantly we want China to maintain their economy and because if the tariff affects the Chinese market and it shouldn't and there are more ways for China to go into a recession before this. Mark shouldn't be affected as long as they continue to attract more subscription base customers from any market sector that would need or want KanKan.

They claimed to offer ""disruptive solutions for Fintech, Targeted Marketing, Predictive, Analysis, Market Research, Competitor Analysis, and Consumer Behavior Analysis.  A couple months ago their they release an extremely optimistic forward guidance expected to quintuple in 2018. They have an institutional holding of 16.38% which is quite substantial and notably one of their investor is CP group, a Thai Congolmerate who were the first to enter China when they opened their market to the world. Now this means absolutely nothing as they have money to throw around but it is important to consider that MARK has the eye of big investors. Unfortunately recent events have devastated the stocks and have investors scared. 

.

If you have not read about it, this was the Reddit I heard about it from. https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/7ctau5/you_need_to_check_out_ai_led_remark_holdings_mark/

MARK shows some weakness in their management and public relations as recent events unfolded but it uncertain what maybe the cause of it. The recent bogus report that claim MARK was fradulent was eventually deletedhttps://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2018_02_06_mark_external.pdf, but stocks eventually tumbled under 10$ which show never had happened. Unfortunately MARK's weak rebuttal that was clean and clear but vague on exactly what they do perhaps to maintain secrecy against other AI companies. Their CFO have also recently sold his shares. Now this may mean nothing at all and perhaps we can give them the benefit of the doubt and this is where part of the risk comes from. They could simply be fully focused on developing KanKan while maintaining their other subsidiaries, but without investors that cannot succeed. I'm pretty sure the people who were on margins were devastated. And because MARK is a small market cap they could simply be inexperienced with public relations.

.

The other part of the risk is simply KanKan is a unproven technology in their early stages.  Claims are simply claims, one that stood out to me is that they claim KanKan's War Room is like no other. This is just one of their many bold claim like quintupling of their AI revenue. But let see.

The reason why MARK stocks went up last week started with a confirmed contract, and days earlier before these event they showed an example of KanKan, followed by a report by Shanghai university.

On March 6 MARK signed a contract with 7/11 Thailand to deploy KanKan through 11,000 stores that is owned by CP group. This is incredibly important, CP group is not only investing but also implementing them into their system.  https://twitter.com/RemarkHoldings/status/970994294453604353 It goes without saying you shouldn't invest in something you don't understand and invest in what you use like shaq's wheaties/fruity pebbles deal. Now the example they showed (March 2), showed absolutely nothing of value to the everyday investor, https://twitter.com/RemarkHoldings/status/969595666040147970 I am not tech expert but I am pretty sure its complex to track movements.

On March 8, Shanghai university wrote a report on Kankan which is unfortunately deleted. https://twitter.com/jgrim375/status/971809430776971268?s=19 I actually forgot but I do remember they are would like to enter the Japanese market, although a weak growth economy they have a market opened to innovation. In a country high dependent on tech this would be fantastic if they could.

Other big news that I don't think people caught on was Ping-An on cnbc spoke to use their AI system. And guess what AI they are planning to use. Your's truly KanKan. I don't think most people caught on since they didn't specifically state KanKan. https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/08/17/ping-an-is-far-ahead-in-using-a-i-in-the-insurance-business-exec.html

We want a a strong China in the coming months. We do not want a recession but that recession will not becaused by the steel and aluminum tariffs. There are a helluva more things that can topple the Chinese market before this. According to federal info we receive only 2-4% of steel from China, the concern with this is that there is some belief that steel is being shipped through transshipment by shipping raw material to other countries before the entering the US and that is what we record. Tracking transshipping is incredibly hard so it is uncertain. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/08/angus-king/does-much-steel-does-us-import-china/ But shipping steel is also really heavy and expensive it would be absurd to transship (this is purely my opinion it wouldn't surprise me that china is doing it like russia is murdering journalists), there are claims that china is flooding that the market with steel at a loss  in order to curb production but of course china dismisses this. http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36099043

So why is this important, it is not. This will not affect MARK as long as mark can attract subscription based customers from any market sectors.

Forget 7/11, who the hell cares in fact, we want China and Japan but more importantly CHINA. Forget the tiny deal with 7/11. China is leaning towards being wallet free in major cities. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75AXINUL47g Where we concern ourselves with privacy in the states. The chinese have allowed Alibaba and Tencent access to massive amount of consumer data. In china everyone is paying with either alipay or wechat (tencent). KanKan's supposed ability would be an invaluable tool and entering the Japanese market who are obviously technologically advance would be just another happy aneurysm.

other stuff mark do and there are more this is one of them - credit score through social media that banks in china uses as a credible source.
.

The dip that came on Friday, and it is barely a dip dropping only 12 cents. MARK still shows some strong RSI. EDIT infact it is back up today.

.

TLDR: Don't fear MARK. Invest in what your willing to lose. I am absolutely not responsible for your decisions. Do your own DD. 


EDIT: Additional disclosure: My intent in redditing this to inform investors about developments related to Remark Media. I did not and do not intend to suggest any specific action by any investor or shareholder and strongly suggest that any decision made to buy or sell shares of this stock be made after consultation with an investment advisor as to the suitability of such an investment.

Social media is much better than Hasbro or Matel and they can get a toy out on shelves in roughly 3 weeks - allowing them to be able to have some of the quickest market action in the pop culture market.

QuantalyticsResearch;1520874040;83wipy;;0;;2;"While global markets have modestly rebounded from the volatility fueled panic seen at the beginning of last month, the financial sector has caught our eye in the United States - specifically, regional banks. The financial sector has had tailwinds for the past 18 months: the US Federal Reserve began its path to normalizing monetary policy, US policy of deregulation, and most recently tax cuts. Although these tailwinds have been reflected with strong returns within the financial sector, Quantamize believes that regional banks still have significant upside. Our rationale is that the S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) still trades at a discount with a Fwd 12M P/E ratio of 14.8 &amp; a Fwd 12M EPS Growth rate of 25.9% providing a PEG ratio of .57. Additionally, the US Swap Curve has finally begun to steepen which will translate into an improvement in net interest margins &amp; profitability for US regional banks. Providing macroeconomic support, Household Debt to GDP &amp; Debt Service to Disposable Income levels are at two decade lows. These points led us to analyze a high conviction trade idea which we posted in our Q-Options page which provides investors an attractive trade due to multi-factor &amp; quantitative volatility analytics.

**SWCH is a data center, colocation business that has more growth potential than its peers. This is because it is a data center company which is not structured as a REIT. REITS have to pay 90% of their earnings as dividends to remain classified as a REIT and reap those tax benefits. The large data center companies like EQIX and DLR are REITS because of the large amounts of properties they own. SWCH chose to be structured a different way, as a UPC, so they can reinvest their earnings back into their company.**


Switch has their main data center facility in Las Vegas, Nevada, and this facility has an interesting story. In 2002, the CEO Rob Roy attended an Enron auction for this facility. The facility was built with millions of dollars, and Roy bought it for $930K. This was a clear and very strategic move by Roy, and these strategic moves have continued through the life of his company. I like this because it shows the CEO is very strategic, and his decisions have been smart and executed so far.


Comparison's of their locations to two large other colocations businesses, Equinix (EQIX) and Digital Trust Realty (DLR):


* SWCH has a fully operational campus called Core in Las Vegas. This is their primary revenue campus with a utilization rate of 94%, gross square footage of 2M, and power capacity at 275MW with construction of another facility bringing it up to 315MW. Their other campuses are a bit unnerving. They have a campus in Tahoe Reno with one operational building with a total of eight buildings planned. Their operational building in Tahoe is 1.4M square feet with up to 130MW of power capacity. These campuses in Nevada are connected through their proprietary superloop which connects lucrative California markets to these data centers. Smart, because they are paying the lower costs with lower chance of natural distasters for more data center space and are still connected to the large markets. Switch also has a facility in Grand Rapids, Michigan. They have an office building that is 660K sq ft, and one operational building with up to 20MW capacity at 680K sq ft. The other three buildings in MI with the rest 120MW power and 1M sq ft are planned. I am a bit skeptical that the majority of their locations are ""planned"". They also have a planned campus in Atlanta. They have SUPERNAP facilities in Thailand and Italy as well.


* EQIX has data centers located in Seattle, Silicon Valley, LA, Denver, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Miami, Atlanta, D.C., Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, among other locations. 

* DLR has the same locations, and Oakland, Phoenix, Portland, Sacramento, San Francisco, Austin, Charlotte, NJ, and Northern Virginia. 

* The international business is important, but I want to focus on the North American portion of the business.


As you can see, SWCH doesn't have many locations but they are located stratetigcally with high quality centers. This is where quality over quantity comes in. I think eventually the cost of data will exceed expense budgets, and moving to a further out data center like the Las Vegas one would be a better budgetary option. 


Now to Financials, which is limited because they only have one quarterly report:


* To measure the health of this business, it's common practice to use a non gaap accounting method called Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for EQIX, DLR, and SWCH is $2.05B, $1.4B, and $195M respectively. Switch has a high estimate of $195M in adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2017. When we compared this to debt of 819M, we actually get a very attractive multiple of 4.16 for SWCH. EQIX Debt/Adj. EBITDA multiple is 2.67, while DLR's is 6.23. If we use EQIX Debt to Americas Adjusted EBITDA multiple it get's even better, a multiple of 6.69. From this measure, SWCH is attractive, but it's relative to the amounts of debt these companies have. Adj. EBITDA Margin is a good measure to look at too. EQIX is at 47% margin, DLR 58%, and SWCH 50%. 

* Cost of debt. Interest expense / Debt. This will be a measure to see if debt is resonably managed so it doesn't throw off the above multiple. EQIX has a cost of debt of 6.73%, DLR 2.97%, and SWCH 3.30%. SWCH is still attractive.

* Revenue. SWCH's nine month revenue for their colocation business is 226M which is 17% y/y growth. Their connectivity segment is 49M, 24% y/y growth. Full year 2017 revenue is expected to be within 372M-380M. EXIQ Revenue grew 21% to 4.4B in 2017, and DLR revenue grew 15% to 2.5B. SWCH has a small piece of the worldly pie, but a fairly larger piece of North America.


I have found some worries which I'll outline:

* Lawsuit from Cobalt Data centers. I investigated this and it looks like the CEO of Cobalt left SWCH, opened up business and failed, so they sued SWCH blaming them for monopolization of the Las Vegas region. Also, Cobalt doesn't even have a website, their domain is for sale.

* A lot of SWCH's facilities are planned, not even in construction. I looked on google maps at their Tahoe location and I didn't find much buildings there, there are construction vehicles though. It is next to the Gigafactory though, interestingly. I also couldn't find the facility in Thailand on google.

* Glassdoor company reviews tell a story of power hungry people and a negative company culture which fires anyone who brings up problems. Could be worrisome. Could also be the strict nature of mission critical businesses.



**Conclusion**


What this information has shown me is that the 13 operational buildings SWCH owns out of 24 planned has 10% Adj. EBITDA of EQIX America's Adj. EBITDA. EQIX is the largest data center business in the world, and SWCH is trading at a 4.7B enterprise value while EQIX is 36.8B. Low utilization rates in SWCH's other facilities show there is more revenue growth avialable. The only risk now is if SWCH doesn't execute their other facilities in a timely manner.


TL:DR SWCH is a data center company trading at 4.6B Enterprise value with 10% the Adj. EBITDA as the largest data center business in the world, and 14% of the second largest, DLR. If they finish their facilities they will have large revenue growth, and they are able to retain their earnings unlike EQIX and DLR.


I bought 30 shares yesterday and an Apr $16 call, waiting to open a larger position.

blueblarflubar;1521130051;84nlza;;61;;136;"Overstock.com reports earnings after market today (On basically one of the last possible days to report q4 2017 earnings).

First: Take a look at their website's performance in the areas we are comparing (q4 2016 vs q4 2017): https://i.imgur.com/M34HXL4.png . Notice anything? Traffic to their website has PLUNGED. Their website rankings have dropped from above 800 to just above 2000.

Meanwhile, lets take a look at their STOCK PRICE in the past year. https://i.imgur.com/JzojFwa.png . The stock price has increased almost 3x?

WHY? Because OSTK announced late last year that they were big into.... B L O C K C H A I N. However, their blockchain thing tzero is way behind schedule and they are doing the gay thing where they are trying to do everything ""by the book"" and this wont work because people trading crypto do not give a shit and just want to trade all their money right away. 

TLDR: OSTK announced that they were into B L O C K C H A I N and their price spiked despite having their actual e-commerce business get absolutely raped by amazon and plunging in traffic. They report earnings today and will have to admit this.

The problem is they spent a ton on this purchase, which means they took on a lot of debt and need to pay it back which is going to dig into their dividends.

(This reminds me a lot of [TEVA and their massive acquisition of Allergan Generics for $40.5 Billion](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7jkncu/12000_teva_bet_and_some_dd/) that added a lot of debt to their income statement).

CANT_MILK_THOSE;1521157672;84r65l;;32;;127;"So recently there was a post on the front page whining about the lack of DD in this sub and it got me thinking.  Since most of you are too retarded to generate an original thought I'll get you up to date on a nice YOLO with a company I've never seen anybody talk about in this sub (and for good reason): Newell Brands. 

Lets take a quick look at what Newell actually does.  Possibly the most boring company I've ever looked into, Newell is a marketer of consumer and commercial brands.  Under Newell's various business units you can find brands like: Rubbermaid, Rawlings, Marmot, Coleman, Sharpie, Elmers, Calphalon, Graco, and the list goes on.  Much like the backside of my nuts, these are brands your mothers are very familiar with. However, we don't give a fuck about any of these fundamentals and I've already gone into too much detail to be honest.  What we are looking to profit off of is the vote coming up at their 2018 Shareholders meeting that will decide who gets control of the board - which will in turn decide the direction of the company.

This all started when Michael Polk (the current CEO) decided to [aquire Jarden](http://ir.newellbrands.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2016/Newell-Brands-Announces-Completion-of-Newell-Rubbermaid-and-Jarden-Corporation-Combination/default.aspx) back in 2016. Only reason this is important is because it is the Jarden Chairman and CEO, Martin Franklin, that accuses Michael Polk of mismanaging the brands.  A year after this acquisition investors were expecting big results, but Newell delivered just the opposite.  After a series of downgrades blamed on ""resin supply issues"" from Hurricane Harvey Newell release a shit earnings, [which i profited nicely on via puts](https://imgur.com/a/A8Gct).  

Now I'm not sure what Michael Polk was smoking when he hatched this plan, but in a complete reversal from the growth plan that had been laid out in prior years, Newell announced they were planning [to sell off nearly half their brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/25/newell-brands-stock-craters-20-percent-unveils-plans-to-sell-off-assets.html).  Fed up with this Franklin, along with two of his colleagues, stepped down from the board.

WSJ Link: https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-newell-brands-a-fight-over-the-board-and-strategy-1517394600

Broke Boy Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/08/martin-franklin-who-sold-his-company-to-newell-is-now-waging-a-battle-against-the-newell-board.html

Upon stepping down, Franklin was and still is a large shareholder of Newell and he teamed up with Starboard Value, an activist investing firm, along with other former Jarden execs to sieze control of the board.  They published a [letter](http://www.starboardvalue.com/wp-content/uploads/Starboard_Value_LP_Letter_to_NWL_CEO_and_Board_02.12.2018.pdf) that, in summary, says Polk doesn't know what the fuck he is doing and also listed their candidates for board elections at the upcoming shareholder conference.  Newell then [clapped back](http://ir.newellbrands.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Newell-Brands-Independent-Directors-Issue-Open-Letter-to-Shareholders/default.aspx) with a letter of their own stating that Franklin is out his god damn mind and that they are fully committed to divesting large portions of the business.  To really spice things up, Carl Ichan has recently [taken a ""large position""](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/icahn-reveals-newell-brands-stake-as-starboard-pushes-for-change) in Newell but claims to be undecided on which camp he will vote in favor of.

Where this leaves us is a nice opportunity to bet that the vote will go in favor of Franklin and Starboard which should lead to a spike in the short term share price.  Let's look at the facts: 

- Newell has been terribly mismanaged to get to a point where they are trying to unwind half the company despite many of these brands having synergy

- The recent string of board resignations culminating with the resignation of Kevin Conroy who then [threw his support](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/former-newell-director-indicates-support-200000216.html) towards Starboard is a strong indicator of the momentum starboard has among key shareholders

- With the share price popping 6% after the news of Conroy adding support to Starboard, it is clear general shareholder sentiment is in favor of the change in power

- You guys jizz over PE and this Newell's PE is currently low as fuck (5.6 TTM)

The premium for options have always been pretty cheap in my opinion for this company so join me in buying calls on what should be a nice short term spike when Polk inevitably gets booted.  I think Polk resignes before to avoid a humiliation, but the shareholders conference should happen some time in May so we will be buying the June Options.  I have currently opened up a small position at the 30 strike [proof](https://imgur.com/a/sD7MA) but plan on expanding into the 32-33 range until my position is comfortably oversized.  Feel free to reverse my trades I'm basically guaranteeing a win for Polk by posting here.

If I download this data en mass, combine it with stock performance info for the time surrounding the buy and/or sell, I could probably identify congressmen whose stock picks are ""lucky"",  using data analytics.

tanboots;1521207031;84vf3y;Options;17;;19;"2017 was a clusterfuck of a year for United Airlines. It seemed like they couldn't stop hitting the headlines with consecutive bad press. From [beating an old asian man](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/04/27/united-dragging-report-our-review-shows-that-many-things-went-wrong-that-day/?utm_term=.0fd81463637e) and [blaming the bloodied and bruised victim for being disruptive](http://deadline.com/2017/04/united-airlines-ceo-passenger-dragged-outraged-statement-1202067835/), to [forcibly wrestling a violin away from a costumer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/06/06/an-airline-tried-to-get-a-musician-to-check-her-17th-century-violin-a-wrestling-match-ensued/?utm_term=.1c487fc49491), just to name a few, they couldn't fucking stay out of the news. They also have the confirmed highest kill count of customers pets by [the US Department of Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/2017FebruaryATCR.pdf) (PDF warning, page 56 for details), ultimately responsible for more than 1/3rd of all animal related deaths, injuries, and losses for all US carriers.  
  
All that being said, you would think that all hands would be on high alert to avoid any potential bad press. After all, doesn't the management owe it to shareholders to ensure high quality service is provided to customers? Lmao, **fuck no**! In just the past 2 days alone, United Airlines put a 10 month old puppy into an overhead bin (and killed it) and *then* put a different dog on a flight from Denver, Colorado to Wichita Falls, Kansas on a flight to Japan. The dog was without food or water (not required for the 4 hour flight), as well as medicine it needed for an infection, for the entire 16 hour flight. Articles by [New York Times](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/united-airlines-dog-death.amp.html), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/us/united-flight-dog-mix-up/index.html), and others are already making the rounds on the morning news and social media. The volatility, general unease in DC, and other tensions could potentially see this recent development in United's confirmed track record of fuck ups finally take a big chunk out of their share price.  
  
I recommend taking a look at different short positions to take on United in the future. Should you be wary of United turning its life around and being less of a shitbag? Historically speaking... it's not likely. ";237828;Short United Airlines ($UAL), DD inside;
douchecookies;1521207065;84vf8q;;10;;24;"As most know, Adobe (**ADBE**) has been kicking butt and its topped profit and revenue estimates for the seventh straight quarter with it's subscription based creative cloud.

A lot of companies (mine included) didn't want to switch to a subscription based payment plan so we've been using CS4 for years. However, as computer OS keep upgrading, the Creative Suites are losing compatibility making it impossible to run. 

As companies upgrade their hardware and OS for security and performance reasons, they'll be forced to upgrade their CS software. Pretty soon nobody will be able to run CS software and they'll have to choose between a CC subscription or other software. 

Since ADBE is the industry standard for a lot of their software and it would be more expensive to change an entire pipeline just to avoid a subscription based fee, it's a good bet that subscriptions will keep increasing for the next couple years.

_____________

Autodesk (**ADSK**) is in a similar situation. A lot of the older versions of 3DS max, Maya, AutoCAD, etc are starting to lose compatibility with modern OS. Keep an eye on both as this software is essential for companies that built pipelines around them and they'll be forced to start paying for the subscriptions.

KingOfTheCouch13;1521217719;84wq9h;;106;;95;"I think one of the problems is though that RH is waaaay too lax with their lending and advanced features. To get margin and options all you have to do is tell them you want them. So now you have traders with like $2000 plus $2000 margin in their accounts. If the market crashes, it's tough shit for the people who took out the loans because now they have margin calls. 

Normally I'd say thats not a problem because the fault lies on the trader. But when you have traders with $2000 to their name that just lost all their money plus $2000 of the brokers money, how is the broker supposed to get their money back? I seriously doubt someone with $2000 to their name will have the income to just drop another $2000 in to cover the margin call. Sure you could transfer  the debt to collections, but the problem still isn't solved until the debt is actually paid.

You saw how many RH accounts got destroy on the XIV implosion. That's only one security. If the whole market is falling like a rock, margin accounts will get killed left and right. Other brokers have made it through crashes before but they don't cater specifically to users with low funds/income that take high risks. That can lead to way more margin calls going unpaid, where RH takes a hit as well. Won't it hurt their business if they lend money that can't be paid back? How do other brokers handle this situation?

Tldr: Robinhood lends to users that may not be able to pay back margin calls in a complete crash. If they can't get their money back in a timely manner, can this hurt their sustainability as a broker?";237966;Could a 2008-like crash kill RH?;

CudderKid;1521230482;84yc7t;;51;;207;"Welcome to “Understand What you’re invest in” edition 1.0. These posts are intended to educate autistic traders about our most beloved category of assets, MEMESTOCK BOIS. This edition will cover one of my personal favorites, JD.com ($JD).


What:

 JD.com is an ecommerce sales company based in Beijing, China that deals in direct selling of consumer goods; JD does not have any brick and mortar sales locations nor does it manufacture any of its product offerings, all items are sourced from 3P manufacturers and distributors. JD also offers an online marketplace for vendors and consumers to host and purchase 3P merchandise. TLDR: JD is China’s “Amazon Lite” before Amazon developed web services and proprietary product lines.


Why:

 Two driving factors behind JDs potential for growth that we have all heard before; China’s middle-class is exploding and brick and mortar is dying. China’s urban household income is expected to double by 2022 (Mckinsey research). This will lead to a shift in total spending from the lower class to the middle and upper-middle class of Chinese households; meaning less of China’s total spending will be controlled by poors buying “needs” and more of China’s spending will be Alphas buying electronics, tailored clothing, household “Nice-to-haves” etc…


Let us look at the past 12 quarters’ revenue numbers to support this spending theory:


$5.9B


$7.4B


$7B


$8.5B


$8.3B


$9.9B


$9B


$11.6B


$11.1B


$13.6B


$12.6B


$16.7B


Estimates Q1 2018 15.6$ 


(B-b-b-ut Mr. fag trades, this is lower than last quarter!!! – holiday spending you dumb autist, this would be a 41.16% YOY growth for Q1.)


JD.com owns and operates 210 warehouses (~4 MILLION square meters) in China’s 50 biggest cities, as well as operating over 5,300 deliver and pickup stations. The distribution network is solidly established and DOES NOT include any storefront overhead.


Investor Snapshot: 
Market cap - $64B
Shares held by institutions – 55%
Short interest - 2.2%
30 day put/call ratio – 0.6
1 Year sales growth – 40%
5 Year sales growth – 54%
1 Year EPS growth – 104%
EPS growth forecast – 60.99% (1 year)


JD’s drop from all time highs resulted from a missed earnings in Q4 2017, where revenue actually BEAT. The miss can be attributed to JD reinvesting in itself:
“Despite posting better-than-expected revenue for the quarter, net income was down 17.7 percent at 449 million versus a mean analyst estimate of 666 million according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
In a call with analysts following the release of the results CFO Sidney Huang said smaller margins were linked to investments in new business lines including logistics investments, overseas expansion, artificial intelligence and cloud services.”


Reduced PPS also resulted from another $1B infusion from Tencent and a capital raise campaign of $1.9B open to Chinese banks and investment firms. 


Available ratings:


Market edge – long


Reuters Research – outperform


Morningstar – 3 stars


Concerns:


Alibaba competition


Potential to take on too much at once (international expansion, AI, web services, etc…)


Chinese economic downturn


Expensive by P/E standards


Disclaimer: OP Is looking for an entry for about $5K into LEAPS (2019/2020) but currently does not hold any JD. However, previous calls on JD have all been profitable so I am slightly biased.

I've tried shorting $SNAP, longing $MSFT, being lazy with $SPY, and so far none of it has been great. Kinda considering going double or nothing on Micron's earnings report. 

Now, before your dicks get too hard, my account is worth just shy of $2,000, which is technically my life savings at 20 but not actually that much at all. I know $MU is a meme, but literally everything is looking up for them. Technicals are looking real nice, especially after the EOD run up. PEG ratio is is right in the sweet spot. They've been beating earnings for like a year now too with more and more business flowing in every week. The only stopping me from throwing my cash at weeklies is the fact that itll take me a few months to rebuild my capital if I lose it all, and I wouldnt want to miss out on tendies for that long.

T0mThomas;1521483215;85lnaa;;16;;20;"These databases are archaic and antiquated. They're being manhandled by MSSQL and modern simpler database offerings like NoSQL.

Beyond my chimpish analysis of general market factors, the valuation looks stretched with no upside. With 8% discount rate and similar cost of equity, the current valuation assumes a constant long term 4% free cash flow growth, while the trend suggests closer to 2% - and that's assuming pretty aggressive revenue growth of 4-5%, which they haven't achieved once in the last 5 years. 

The only upside here might be benefits from reduced corporate rate and repatriation of cash effects. I looked into this briefly and found analyst estimates that 47.5b of the projected 54.5b is ""indefinitely reinvested in Oracle's foreign operations"", so there's not much of an upside there either.

Never much more than 5% in a single ticker, rarely options other than selling covered calls, Barely using margin. This dip buying is the most deviated I've ever been from my boring /r/personalfinance vanilla prudence. I was fully invested so dipped ~250k into margin to buy FB and GOOG so far (a little at opening and a little late morning). Potentially thought about dipping even more before had a brief moment of lucidity and decided to ask a question here before truly maxing margin.

Wasn't even in FB except for tangential exposure through small QQQ position. Don't know how I ended up so on tilt. 

My reading was that FB didn't seem to maliciously breach user data privacy, it was more Cambridge Analytica's intentional violation of FB guidelines. As such I can't imagine the fines being as astronomical as earlier suggested (if at all). 

I also don't understand why GOOG is so dragged down in this other than the relatively vague umbrella of ""data privacy"". Maybe this does spur new regulation on data rich tech, but I can't imagine what type of worst case regulation would butcher FB and GOOG in the long run?

bemore84;1521646678;8631iq;;2;;5;"Dear Google,

I know you're always looking to improve your products and services, and 99% of the time you are on point. However, your latest move away from the Google Finance setup was a move in the wrong direction. I'm involved with several investing communities throughout other websites (Yahoo, Reddit, etc.) and all of them conclusively agree, the new Finance layout is awful. The helpful parts of the old format were the ability to check out individual stocks with an easily usable chart with customizable features within it. ALSO, it was critical to be able to see the most recently visited stock tickers along the left panel of the screen while also being able to track your portfolio picks on the right side. This was an extremely powerful tool to watch the entire market from a single screen. Now, we have been limited to looking at ONE stock with very weak user interface on the actual chart. Technically, you could say we have a ""portfolio"" view, but it's clunky and only 3 or 4 stocks fit on the screen at one time. I want to see a compact list of stocks, their current price, and their day's change (either in % or $). Until Google makes a move back towards this interface, I will definitely continue to seek out other options. I can confidently say that the new Google Finance layout *hurts* my ability to track stocks and make informed decisions on multiple securities in a single day. 

Faithfully yours in other areas,

DD:  
  
Really have mixed opinions here. Short interest is surprisingly low, so maybe its not oversold, but it's clearly been called out as a loser plenty by analysts, and it's way down in the last week, month, 6 months, year, etc.  
  
GE seems to be having a hard time making a profit, and it sounds like there's some sort of restructuring going on. Between the dividend being cut and the last earnings report, things haven't been good for GE. however, their market cap is close to their annual revenue (mkt cap 120B vs annual revenue ttm 121.5B), so if they can turn things around it could pop up.  
  
My thoughts are that the next earnings report (4/20/2018) has a good chance of triggering a large movement in either direction. The expectations are considerably lower than in the past, and if they can meet or exceed them, especially with all the negative press, the stock price could pop upward. Likewise, if they can't meet even these newer, reduced expectations, confidence will continue falling and may result in a big drop.  
  
With that in mind, im looking at an options play with a 5/18 expiry (to allow for a run either direction after the 4/20 earnings). Furthermore, options (at least the closest ITM to current price) look relatively cheap. A call would need a 3% increase or so to breakeven and a put would only need a little more than 1% decrease.  
  
I'm holding off on opening this til after the Fed meeting to reduce uncertainty at the time i open the position.  
  
What i'm really debating is straddle vs strangle, or maybe a strip. Anyone got thoughts?";240087;"$GE options play &amp; DD";

icon99;1521655943;864c73;;4;;1;"The population of humans is growing immensely and the rapid growth is unsustainable to keep track of efficiently. Moreover, to be able to keep track of every person is an even harder task. For example, many people are undocumented in vast overpopulated counties such as India and China. 

If governments are having such trouble documenting everyone and keeping information of them then just imagine how difficult it is for one entity. I believe God is struggling to keep track of the various amounts of people. Also the limited number of angels used to keep track of us is dwindling down. Reports say many angels are putting in 60 hour work weeks with unpaid overtime. But what does Facebook and Google have to do with this? I believe in the near future that they will grow and eventually be in charge of counting the good and bad deeds of every human in the world. This sounds ambitious at first which is why God will likely first experiment with contract work but I feel confident that Facebook and Google will prove their worth to get a long term deal.

HappyCamper1980;1521661188;8653ql;;13;;25;"I want to share an update on the Cambridge Analytica situation -- including the steps we've already taken and our next steps to address this important issue.

We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.

Here's a timeline of the events:

In 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social. Your calendar should be able to show your friends' birthdays, your maps should show where your friends live, and your address book should show their pictures. To do this, we enabled people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them.

In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends' data. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends' data.

In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, we announced that we were changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the data apps could access. Most importantly, apps like Kogan's could no longer ask for data about a person's friends unless their friends had also authorized the app. We also required developers to get approval from us before they could request any sensitive data from people. These actions would prevent any app like Kogan's from being able to access so much data today.

In 2015, we learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica. It is against our policies for developers to share data without people's consent, so we immediately banned Kogan's app from our platform, and demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that they had deleted all improperly acquired data. They provided these certifications.

Last week, we learned from The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as they had certified. We immediately banned them from using any of our services. Cambridge Analytica claims they have already deleted the data and has agreed to a forensic audit by a firm we hired to confirm this. We're also working with regulators as they investigate what happened.

This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.

In this case, we already took the most important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people's information in this way. But there's more we need to do and I'll outline those steps here:

First, we will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity. We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit. And if we find developers that misused personally identifiable information, we will ban them and tell everyone affected by those apps. That includes people whose data Kogan misused here as well.

Second, we will restrict developers' data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your data if you haven't used their app in 3 months. We will reduce the data you give an app when you sign in -- to only your name, profile photo, and email address. We'll require developers to not only get approval but also sign a contract in order to ask anyone for access to their posts or other private data. And we'll have more changes to share in the next few days.

Third, we want to make sure you understand which apps you've allowed to access your data. In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you've used and an easy way to revoke those apps' permissions to your data. We already have a tool to do this in your privacy settings, and now we will put this tool at the top of your News Feed to make sure everyone sees it.

Beyond the steps we had already taken in 2014, I believe these are the next steps we must take to continue to secure our platform.

I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform. I'm serious about doing what it takes to protect our community. While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn't change what happened in the past. We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward.

I want to thank all of you who continue to believe in our mission and work to build this community together. I know it takes longer to fix all these issues than we'd like, but I promise you we'll work through this and build a better service over the long term.";240144;Message from the Zuck;

Hi everyone,

I am a college senior majoring in business and neuroscience. I became close friends with a neuroscience professor I work with, who asked me for advice on her financial situation. I told her that although I currently have been receiving high returns in my portfolio, I take exorbitant risks that she should in no way consider for her IRA or 401k.

It was at this point that I learned she does not have a IRA or 401k. Apparently, neither does her husband. Additionally, she does not have a college fund set up for her children. Her daughter and son are about to enter college and (In fall of this year and next year respectively) they are planning to ""pay for expenses as it comes.""


**retirement &amp; current income**

She has told me that her retirement plan is essentially ""die working here."" While she does not have a retirement account, working at this university until the day she dies will be her income stream into retirement years. Both she and her husband are currently in their late 50s. There is an opportunity for her to teach at a medical school where she could potentially receive more income. Her husband, has worked at a small business since his 20s. However, the owner of that business is hitting 80 and the owner's son is not very bright. Thus, that business will likely be sold where her husband will be paid in ~3 months salary. At which point, he will be out of a job and unable to find work. Her husband currently makes ~70k a year, something he considers to be significant as he does not have a college education.


**assets &amp; expenses**

At the moment, their biggest asset is their house. However, they do not expect to receive any financial help from their family members at any point (no trust funds, nothing left other in parents' wills). 

This means that they need to find to pay for their own expenses during retirement. 


**how to proceed**

Based on her situation, what do you guys recommend for her? I know about IRA and 401k (or 403b in the case of an university), what else should she utilize? 

What about her investments? How much should she reasonably set aside per year and how long can she reasonably work for? While she said that she plans on working until the day she dies, there comes a age where one is too ill to work. What is that reasonable estimate? Lastly, given that timeframe, should she be using a classic risk-parity portfolio or something more aggressive or conservative?


Thank you for all of your advice!

Fughazi;1521723871;86bc23;;19;;11;"#tl;dr CEO of Longfin sold his Blockchain startup to himself. Resulted in LFIN share price increasing &gt;1200% and market cap increasing by over $2 billion. That company will earn $3 million this year. Buy puts.

LongFin is a “global” fintech company that operates out of a WeWork shared office space for fledgling entrepreneurs. According to LongFin, their business model consists of:
#
-  [Importer/Exporter Financing] (https://youtu.be/LnIKiNAupRs?t=46s)
-  Electronic Market Making 
-  Blockchain powered Smart Contract Solutions
-  Financial Institution Intermediation
-  Blockchain powered Treasury Management Engine
	
Their website greets you with a convoluted mess of buzzwords, stock images, and “market size” numbers. This quote on their homepage attempts to summarise their clusterfuck of a business model:
&gt;**Reimagining the world of Alternative Finance (Shadow Banking), $72 trillion industry powered by Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Blockchain enabled Smart Contracts.**

This is probably starting to get confusing, so to make it worse, [here is a video of the CEO attempting to explain what it is that his company does](https://youtu.be/31eI-O1ZW1E). During these ten minutes, LFIN share price dropped 16%.

“Fughazi” you are saying, “What’s this about Blockchain I hear?” Alas, we need to go further down the rabbit hole.

To truly grasp just how terrible this company is, let’s start from before it went public and associated itself with Blockchain. Although little information is available, LongFin has published its [unaudited financials going back to 2014](https://www.longfincorp.com/financials.html) on its website.
#
- The 2016 fiscal year yielded $40 million in revenue and $7 million net profit.
- The 2017 fiscal year yielded $28 million in revenue and $1.8 million net profit.

On December 13, 2017, LFIN was listed on the Nasdaq at a valuation of $382.5 million. For a company that owns nothing proprietary and relies on buzzwords to fill a page, valuing it at over 13 times current revenue was brave to say the least.

The stock price remained at around $5 until a few days after the IPO, when Longfin announced the acquisition of [Ziddu.com](https://ziddu.com/), a ***blockchain*** microfinance startup. This catapulted the already inflated share price of $5 to $72 in under a week. 

Before Ziddu's acquisition, Longfin had a market cap of around $400M. Today, Longfin’s market cap is $2.62 billion. This suggests that Ziddu carries over $2 billion in value for Longfin’s share price. 

So what? Maybe they were shopping around at the right time and found this diamond in the rough that would grow their business exponentially, right? Not quite. An SEC filing from 12/11/17 reveals that Longfin purchased Ziddu from Meridian Enterprises, ***which is 95% owned by Longfin CEO, Venkat Meenavalli***. That’s right, this dude increased the value of his company over 1200% by playing an autistic game of hot potato with himself using Ziddu. If you want to congratulate them, the CFO’s personal cell is on Longfin’s SEC filings. Even better, the CEO himself said that Ziddu will earn Longfin [***around $3 million***](https://youtu.be/31eI-O1ZW1E?t=6m26s) in the next year. 

Everything accounted for, you may be wondering why I am so in favor of a short position now of all times. Here’s why: Longfin will be having its first earnings report as a publicly listed company on April 8th. Although this itself would not be very important, this will be its first earnings report with Ziddu.com as its subsidiary. 

If we’re extremely generous and assume that the IPO valuation was accurate and the  $100 million purchase price of Ziduu is fair, that would realistically value the company at just under $7 per share. At this point, even the CEO acknowledges that the extremely low float (~1 million shares) is the only thing keeping this ridiculous pump going. The float will tear down the share price just as easily as it brought it up.

So how do you cash in on this shitstain of a company? Well, if you suck off your broker, you might be able to secure a short position, but where’s the leverage in that anyways? This happens to be one of the first Blockchain pump &amp; dumps with options, so I just went ahead and loaded up on puts. First set is April 20 expiration at a strike of $40 to play that earnings dump, and then some June 15 at a strike of $25 to get the rest of that downside.

el_samwize;1521729062;86bwzd;;11;;3;"Good morning fellow autists and retards. After completing my first several tens of options trades through Etrade, I grew tired of paying hundreds of dollars in commissions just so that I could lose my money. I watched all of my friends surpass me, getting ""free options trades"" from a broker called Robinhood. Now, I've heard of this broker, in fact I began my investment career trading stocks with them until I discovered just how lucrative options can't be, at which point I emptied my account and moved to Etrade. I put myself on the list for options in January and it said ""you are #243,000 in line.""

Fuck that, time to open a tastyworks account.

Another friend rubbed it into me that he had just gotten options in Robinhood and I felt sick. After being such a model customer, formerly making modest 7-9% losses per month and now with a $0.00 account balance, why wasn't I allowed to trade options? I opened up Robinhood and checked my place in the line. 603,751. I knew something was broken. 

As a last ditch effort, I deposited my last $100 into my account and asked myself what else I could do. Opened up their investment profile tab and immediately saw the problem. ""Risk tolerance: low. Trading experience: not much. Place on the autism spectrum: not applicable."" Time to make a change. I made my couple adjustments making myself appear much wealthier, much less risk averse, and prayed to our Lord Martin. It worked, I woke up this morning, a mere 8 hours later to a notification saying I was approved for options. Frienss, follow my steps and you will be guaranteed free options trades for the rest of your sorry lives. 

See you all at the food depot later this year.

throwingawaymymoneyy;1521732085;86cale;;18;;12;"I understand the prospect of Trade War might effect other industries but Trump wanted to issue a trade tariff on intellectual property to protect US tech companies. 
&gt;WASHINGTON—The Trump administration’s anti-China tariffs could hit $50 billion of Chinese imports, said an individual with knowledge of the plans.President Donald Trump is scheduled to make an announcement at 12:30 p.m. on tariffs and investment restrictions aimed at China designed to get Beijing to halt practices the U.S. believes violate U.S. intellectual property rights.The U.S. is also expected to announce it would sue China at the World Trade Organization for trade law violations. The tariffs would be assessed separtely without going to the WTO.Trump officials had earlier said that the tariffs would apply to about $30 billion in Chinese imports. An accompanying report on Chinese trade practices is expected to estimate that the harm to the U.S. from improper technology transfer to Chinese firms is $30 billion annually. Beijing improperly forces U.S. firms to transfer their technology to Chinese joint venture partners as a requirement to do business in that nation, the U.S. trade officials allege.It’s not clear why the administration appears to have settled on a larger number. On Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the U.S. was using a computer algorithm it developed to decide which products to target. The U.S. is looking to restrict imports of goods that would harm Beijing, but cause relatively little harm to U.S. consumers and companies.



China's response has been to target US agriculture, 

&gt;China is preparing to hit back at trade offensives from Washington with tariffs aimed at President Donald Trump’s support base, including levies targeting U.S. agricultural exports from Farm Belt states, according to people familiar with the matter.
The plans are part of a strategy that has taken shape in recent weeks as Beijing seeks to avert tariffs by warning of possible repercussions and offering incentives to the U.S., including better access to China’s markets, especially in the financial sector.
China’s President Xi Jinping has taken this carrot-and-stick approach in an effort to avoid a trade war, these people said.
“Any Chinese response to new U.S. tariffs would be measured and proportional,” said a Chinese official involved in policy-making.
The White House plans to announce punitive measures against China on Thursday, including tariffs on at least $30 billion in imports. Those are in addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs taking effect Friday.
In response, China is likely to target U.S. exports of soybeans, sorghum and live hogs, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. The U.S. is among the top suppliers of these products to China, which imports around a third of soybeans that the U.S. produces, data from the two countries show.
How would this negatively effect US tech firms when the tariffs are supposed to work in favor of US tech sector? 

Is there something I'm missing here? or is it just weak hands?

The new tax law removes barriers for the repatriation of near a trillion dollars in foreign held US corporate assets which increases demand for dollars.

The fed has signalled a continued policy of rate increases which in turn drives up treasury yeilds and makes shorting the dollar more expensive.

The dollar index has lagged the libor ois by about 2-3 months for the last 4 years and the libor ois has been on a climb for the last 8 weeks or so which I am interpreting as a technical signal.

So I got sick of losing money this past week, and thought I’d finally give FDs a try. Saw SPY breaking down below 266, then below intraday low of 265.4. Waited too long and bought (200) Mar 23rd 260 puts for 0.29. Dead cat bounce happened, freaked out and sold at 0.31 and watched the contracts drop to 0.2 and thought it was a great decision. Shortly after watched the contracts jump to 0.7 a piece, would’ve been able to sell my 200 contracts at 14,000 when I paid 5800, and net profit would have been: $8200. Instead, since TDA charges me no flat fee and $1.50/contract fee, I ended up paying $600 in commission on a $400 profit trade so I lost $200. Never buying FDs again.

We bounced from the SPY 200 SMA back in January and now it looks we are heading back down to retest it. 

Looking back, January might have been the top. Tax bill got passed, no worries about tariffs or trade war, no worries about Powell and his interest rate schedule. It was a market full of optimism. And honestly, I think we’ve may have double peaked two weeks ago when the SPY hit 280.

But don’t worry, if we do solidly break the 200 day, dont panic. The market will surely want to rekiss the 200 day, and when it does, I’m personally gonna sell everything and go short.

soundofreedom;1521780782;86i52c;YOLO;190;;219;"**Summary**
Market Cap 4.937B
Earnings: None

LongFin (LFIN) is a $5 billion market cap stock promotion run by a professional Indian stock promoter whose share price is highly likely to implode in the next 6 months as toxic financing starts to result in significant share issuance. Assuming LFIN actually has any real business (and there are lots of reasons to believe the company is a complete and utter fraud), LFIN shares are egregiously overvalued trading at roughly 100x peak year pro forma revenues and over 550x peak year profit after tax for a business whose profits declined over 50% in 2017. While the stock is very expensive and difficult to borrow due to the stock’s very limited float, the stock does have a reasonably liquid options market. I recommend buying September $35 puts as the stock is almost certainly worth less than $5 share and probably closer to $1/share.

If you add up all the shares owned by insiders and affiliates of Longfin, of 75,150,200 shares outstanding, only 1,290,789 shares are actually available to trade, making the total available shares to trade just 1.82% of the total.

There is very little liquidity, which means the last place you want to be is selling shares short or selling calls, but it makes buying puts very appealing IF some of these shares become unlocked and sold before September. Incidentally in spite of its float of 1.3 million shares (1.8% of shares outstanding) falling well short of the 5% requirement for index inclusion, LFIN was added to the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 on 3/16. This has driven a dramatic increase in price which is not tied to fundamental value as index ETFs have been filling this newly required position.

On January 23rd Hudson Bay Capital management entered into a USURIOUS 52.7MM financing agreement which closed on February 13th. Under the agreement LFIN will pay Hudson Bay $3.5 million in stock, and has the option to take at its discretion up to 3x this amount per pay period, all in stock. On the 13th of each month, starting in May, Hudson Bay can take $10.5MM in stock and dump it into the stock market. MAY.. JUNE.. JULY.. AUG.. September.

With Hudson having the option to collect shares and sell 50% of the current float in 6 months, this could tank the stock all on its own. This is all assuming it doesn't get delisted for blatant fraud.

This doesn't include the 2MM shares worth $120 million paid to Adamson Brothers to promote the stock which become unlocked sometime before June 11th

They are being sued by a former promoter Krishanu Songhal for 3.3MM shares owed for promotional activity which is roughly 3TIMES THE FLOAT

They also may not be able to get CohnReznick to sign off on their audit report and delay a 10k filing. Which would probably result in increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies and shareholders.

Oh, and the SEC or NASDAQ could just halt trading realizing that the entire thing is a scam

Market cap has risen 20% recently from $4 Billion to 5$ Billion and their headquarters are still an unoccupied coworking space in NYC

I am happy to provide evidence for all claims made and provide answers to any questions regarding this position. I own a significant position in the aforementioned puts and will post proof if needed.

**EDIT:** [Proof of ownership of LFIN Puts](https://i.redd.it/wxokkuwr5jn01.png) I've got $4000 in unrealized losses. If I am right I will probably have somewhere in the range of $20-$40k in gains

**EDIT numero dos:** 

If the stock is delisted from option trading but still trades,usually, they do not add new series of options but trading continues in existing options out to the farthest month in which there is current open interest. If the stock is delisted from trading then it's worthless and puts are worth parity.

Although I honestly believe these guys will delay their 10K filing, will ultimately be investigated by the SEC for fraud, and the shares will go to approximately $0.

Part of it was due to banks selling more and more derivatives and other new financial instruments and drastically increasing their debt to equity ratios.

The problem was that so many of the banks' bets were leveraged on debt, not assets, and the financial instruments were so complex that they didn't even understand what they were selling.

So if banks don't even understand many of the complex financial instruments they sell, I doubt 99% of WSB does.

booze_allen;1521855752;86pyn8;;25;;21;"This past week has been interesting in the markets. Today and yesterday especially. 

We have a president who is not afraid to set the world on fire, so to speak. He has no qualms about destroying the current world order (which has been so good to commerce and the stock market so far). 

Trump's first year was marked by restraint, thanks to his advisers. A tax bill was drawn up and passed, and no one went to war. However, as he has gotten more comfortable with the authority vested to him as President, it appears that Trump's darker instincts have taken hold. And as we all know, one of Trump's most consistent views is his disdain for international trade and desire for autarky. 

We got a trade war this week. I do not believe that Trump will let down or is actually bluffing. Even if the Chinese offer to negotiate, I doubt Trump actually wants to negotiate. He believes that tariffs will force America to make its own stuff again. That is the true aim of this trade war, it's to dissuade firms from importing from abroad and make their own stuff, and employ American workers in the process, to bring about America's former manufacturing prowess. 

It is a fundamental ideological view he has held for more than 30 years. We need to sell more to other nations, and attain a high degree of self-sufficiency. That is how countries ""win"" at trade. 

Trade wars are devastating. I believe that Trump will escalate the matter further. He does not believe in negotiating, only brow-beating. May 1st is an important date to watch, as it's the date that the exemptions to steel tariffs ends for certain countries like Canada, Mexico, the EU, South Korea, et al. 

The result of a trade war is increased inflation, as consumers pay more to get their stuff. Increased inflation will pressure the Fed to raise rates more quickly than anticipated, and with that goes economic growth and the bull market. Banks are especially under pressure. While increased rates help net interest revenue, if fewer people are borrowing as a result, why would it even matter?

The second threat to the bull market is political instability from the 2018 mid-terms and the Mueller investigation. Trump feels threatened by these two things. If Democrats take back the House, they can start restraining him a little. Mueller could release a report that puts Trump in a poor light and perhaps recommend him for impeachment. Trump is an authoritarian, and does not believe in accountability from other government institutions. What might he do to draw attention away from these things? He could start a war. 

With hawks like Pompeo and Bolton on board, I believe that Trump will launch some sort of first strike on North Korea to distract everyone from the results of Mueller's investigation and undercut Congressional authority in the name of ""national security"". 

The results of a Second Korean War? Supply chains to Asia will be disrupted, an important trading partner will have its economy flushed down the toilet, and increased government spending to fund such a war will stretch the United States' financial resources to the limit. 

Look at the charts from yesterday and today. Massive downward selling pressure on high volume towards the end of the day. BTFD is seemingly gone. The market is nervous about the possible things President Trump could do and is re-pricing assets accordingly. 

Conservatively, there's not much one can do. If you are long call options, it's time to GTFO. If you are long stock, and have a time horizon of more than 10 years, it's fine to continue holding (but it will bleed in the meantime). 

If you are 100% cash, I recommend that you stuff 75% of it into a savings account. Use the other 25% to sell long-dated OTM bear call spreads, purchases of long-dated index puts, or long-dated VIX calls. Perhaps even gold mining stocks if you like gold, since it's always a safe haven. 

Tread carefully. 

**TDLR: Bear market will commence soon.** ";240870;The bull market ends this year, thanks to Trump. He might escalate the current trade war, start a real war in North Korea to distract the country from the results of the Mueller investigation, and send SPY puts and the VIX to the moon.

7x2f;1521903988;86tksq;;223;;558;"Alright guys, volatility's back and everyone is making money except for you guys, so here's a quick introduction to some basic option plays for your weekend learning. For those of you wondering about my credibility, I'm a derivatives trader market-making on the SPX. I'll try and dumb things down to entry-level understanding but if something confuses you feel free to ask about it.

**Straddles**

The almighty straddle play. If you're a total beginner to options start here. You cannot trade options well without first understanding how to trade the straddle. To give you an idea of how important it is, traders often ask each other ""what's the straddle?"" to get an instant idea of what's going on in terms of volatility through that one price alone.

Imagine you own a straddle that's worth $5 and expires at the end of today. That means if the stock moves more than $5 in one direction you win. Real fucking simple. So if you think the stock will move more than $5 today, you think vol is cheap, and if you think it will move less than $5 you think vol is expensive. Most of you call vol IV on this sub, idk why, everyone here calls it vol so that's what I'm gonna call it.

Here's the interesting part. Not many of you seem to know what gamma is or how to trade it, but essentially long vol = long gamma = you get longer deltas as the stock ticks up and shorter as it ticks down. Accelerating returns. Real good stuff. So let's say we move $5 up on that $5 straddle we are long. The -50 delta put is now, let's say, -5d and our 50d call is now 95d. We went from flat to long 90d. Assuming a 100x multiplier on the contract that means our position now holds the risk (and benefit) of being long 90 stock. **This is where you want to hedge that risk by selling stock.** Don't sell out the straddle for a profit. Sell the stock and hedge back to flat delta to lock in your pnl. If the future keeps ticking up your short stock position is covered by the now-ITM call. But if the future ticks back down by, say, $5 and we land on the straddle, what happens? The pnl from the straddle goes back to 0, and both options are now 50d so the straddle has 0 delta too. But the short stock position makes $450, so we buy it back for the clean scalp **and we still own the straddle.** So if the stock moves again we get to rinse and repeat. Fucking VALUE BABY. 

**Calendars**

Now that we're rock hard, let's get freakier. Throw in another straddle that expires next week and we're shorting this one. It's going to cost more than the $5 one expiring today so we're receiving cash for this play, or long theta. Daily expiry straddle has a fuck tonne more gamma than next weekly straddle **so we can still scalp deltas**. That's some real good shit right there. 

Now we about to hit some meth and and things are going to get wild. I'm going to lose some of you here but that's okay, your non-retarded brothers-in-arms will march on. [The term structure.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_backwardation#/media/File:Contangobackwardation.png) On that picture replace the word 'price' with 'volatility'. For structured indexes in a low vol environment we expect it in backwardation. That means on our calendar from before (called a straddle swap) we bought low vol and sold higher vol. I don't know how you fucksacks got it backwards but if you **buy low, sell high** then good things tend to happen. In the world of options buying low vol and selling high vol leads to **efficient** positions where the amount of gamma you get for the amount of theta you pay is really great. As your front straddle approaches expiry, you can roll your position by buying back next week's straddle to long and then selling the week behind's straddle. Here's where you can make extra cash by having a good feel for whether the straddle is expensive or not. If it looks a little pricey, ride the short straddle a little while before rolling the position. Moar theta.

Recently we've started seeing the term structure in contango, so short-dated volatility is more expensive than longer-dated volatility (I'm talking forward volatility here). Structurally this represents a significant demand for gamma. We tend to see this term structure when there's some kind of event-driven macro-level uncertainty going on. You know how the higher the vol of an option the less gamma it has?  Well volatility is back and in these higher vol environments you get less gamma for the theta you pay. **Stop fucking buying high.** It's all relative. Option premiums are more expensive now but there is always a higher vol you can sell. Work into spreads to give yourself efficient positions because you understand that high vol also means that **you receive more theta for being less short gamma.** Instead of trying to get as much of that sexy gamma for as little as possible, we're now trying to collect as much of that sweet, sweet theta as we can with as little movement risk as possible.

Happy trading cunts

BIDU will receive two huge benefits, first it gets all of IQs past losses (incurred while it was growing) off the books. Second, it will still own a majority of IQ, so it will share in that sweet sweet Chinese Netflix IPO bump. Add to that that the stock is down 11% in the last week due to dumpster fire’s trade war and dumbfuck Uber killing someone, I think the stock will have a great week.

It seems the rhetoric about china not being able to maintain their dirty float.A free floating yuan may be coming soon. 
With that in mind along with the fact that billions of dollars may be sapped from their economy. As the effects of tariffs take hold. Shorting china seemed/s like the best play. We may actually see a gradual incline is the DOW and SAP as new tariffs will allow American companies to compete with foreign goods. I'll be on the look out to bargain hunt this week. Although the pain in the American stock market may not be over it should hit level out soon. Much sooner than i see china's leveling out.While bargain hunting i'll be avoiding industries that are being targeted by china such as Agriculture. I'm also about thinking eur/yuan in forex but it looks like i might be late to that party.

China may also stop buying treasuries. What does this mean? Rate hikes? Inflationary effects? Just what trump wants? Maybe? Is that a bad thing? not necessarily but knowing how to navigate the market when or if this happens is a good ticket to have in your pocket. How to play this is up to you. it's important to make the distinction between real rates and nominal yields and what effects each has on underlying securities and or assets.As well as what effect each will have on the market as a whole.As we move forward through the turbulence. Every investor should be familiar with market scenarios. 

If china is unable to maintain a dirty float with the yuan. The people's bank of china may not be able to continually maintain an artificial Shanghai SE Composite Index. We saw the PBC come in and buy, in order to prop up their markets on friday. I don't believe their buying power is infinite though.I look forward to finding more opportunity to short china. I also have to remind myself to be wary when doing so as they do manipulate everything and usually as a general rule.I do not dabble in the Chinese stock market but these are unusual times. As an investor i flock to returns short or long it makes no difference.
When long-term yields quickly outperform short-term yields (which we can measure using the Rate of Change indicator) we are likely to see a top in gold – usually a major one. So a short play on gold may be inline if this happens. ";241000;Shorting China. How and why? Market plays and treasuries yields what does it mean?;

jeffynihao;1522081925;87aheu;;11;;3;"ROKU is up big today after announcing coming to Samsung smart TV's this summer.

- Needham, analyst Laura Martin, described Roku as ""next $1billion asset""



-- Lock Up Expiry = 03/27 -- DD from previous post:

The price has dropped from ~38 to just below ~32 and is currently oversold, due to:

- fear of insiders selling their locked-up shares for a profit
- market taking a dump after tariff announcement / rate hike fears

Initial Offering:
15,668,000 shares @ $14.00 = $219,352,000 (IPO Date 9/28/2017)
even at $34, the stock is up 242% from its IPO so some profit taking is expected.

- Roku was up 320% from its IPO price before dropping 34% from its 52wk high after crappy Q4 earnings. 

- ROKU is currently the leading OS for TV streaming, but has major competition from FireTV, AppleTV, AndroidTV. Simply put: the latter got mo' money. 
- They've been able to monetize by: advertising, subscriptions through ROKU, brand buttons on their remotes, etc. Growth is expected to grow from 29% to 32% guidance in 2018
- Past Performance: Annual ARPU growth by 48% and platform revenue by 138% over the past year.

Now the big one...lockup expiry

- Roku's 180 day IPO lockup is set to expire end of March 27th
- about 20 million shares outstanding, $14 IPO....current price ~$36. the concern is insiders wanting to sell to lock in gains and consequently tanking the price.


I am predicting that the stock is going to be oversold as the expiry date comes closer, and will be an opportunity for a nice dip.";241365;It's time finally load up on ROKU;

Texas_Rangers;1522116879;87euvk;;19;;23;"TL;DR: You're not going to see an ugly, drawn-out trade war with China, why? Because the Chinese ruling/political class has both the political power in China and is invested heavily in the Chinese, U.S., and global markets.

-------------



China is starting to get a middle class. But largely, there are poor citizens, and there are the ruling class. 

The political ruling class are rich. More so than those that the rich in the U.S. Think of Russian political nepotism on steroids. That's China. 

Deposit insurance (like the FDIC's coverage of up to $250,000 of bank deposits) is also relevant. In China, you're covered for up to **only** about 80.7k USD. 

&gt; China’s cabinet announced on Tuesday that a long-awaited deposit insurance scheme - covering 99.6 percent of depositors for up to 500,000 yuan ($80,700) each - would be launched on May 1 [2015].

[Source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-banks/china-bank-deposit-insurance-could-tilt-competitive-landscape-idUSKBN0MS3XG20150401
)

What does that mean? Well, like rich people in America, many of the rich have their net worth in the MARKETS. Probably largely the Nikkei 225 and U.S. equities. Sure, probably some bonds (including U.S. bonds), and other assets like realty (plenty of land in China). But LOTS in the equities markets. 

Do the Chinese political elite want a trade war? The Nikkei was down like 4% in one day last week. Does the ruling class like seeing their net worth go down by 4% in a day? Fuck no. 

You're not going to see a trade war because the Chinese political class benefits exactly ZERO from one.

I have been long nvidia for a while and have been relegated this past week, calls down 40% puts up 25% until I sold for stock on Friday. After January nvidia climbed to 240 before tumbling down back to 215 during the correction and instantly climbed back to Ath's after earnings. From that point it has been a constant fluctuation from highs of 250's to lows of 230's. Last week while nvidia recovered 3% from drop the previous day, Jenson Huang's appearance at IBM Think and brief discussion about A.I. made nvidia increase another 2% to finish off the day. I think it's a similar situation to what's going to happen in tomorrow's keynote. After two years everyone is expecting the very successful Pascal line to be replaced with Volta. Volta was first released back in December with the titan volta. A constant fear has been that nvidia may end up not announcing a new product line in order to meditate the risk of having miners flood the market with cheap gpu's while they buy up new ones. The consumer gpu's still account for over 60% of their business and nvidia continues to have a disgusting lead in market share in comparison to AMD so I see likely possibility that they will end up delaying the volta line. That leads into my strategy, I want to sell all my shares and buy up OTM calls and puts for April 6th. I see it very likely that nvidia breaks out of the 250 zone and runs in a gtc 2017 situation or drop on over exaggeration on a proper business move to keep their base.";241482;Nvidia GTC and analysts day play;

What I've been doing recently is paying for data from online sports books, would rather get into the vegas data, but anyways the data tells me total # of bets placed on either side vs total $USD on either side. So you can see where the ""smart money"" pro gamblers are doing. Then I keep that in mind while watching the scores, wait till i can get an in-game live line that's like twice as good as what the pros were already doing, then bet that.

I really like this strategy. Also, for huge games like Alabama vs. Clemson the first time they played in the natty, I think like this- everyone and their brother is going to bet Alabama because of their staying power, also tons of degenerate gamblers from alabama, so I think line is overvalued towards alabama and bet clemson, etc. Keeping in mind that Vegas is a business and likes to safely make money on the vig rather than take more risks

Reddit_Hitler;1522181598;87lq6y;;9;;5;"This market volatility is a reason that a lot of retail traders (you &amp; me) fail. It's nerve-wrecking and almost impossible to know the direction of the markets (especially when you put Trump into the mix). So what's the solution? High-frequency trading (HFT). I'll admit that I don't know (nor does anyone know) exactly what metrics specific HFTs use or what their algorithms are. However, what we do know is the volatility builds arbitrage opportunities. This is HFTs bread and butter. Just look at the chart of $VIRT since the end of January (beginning of market volatility). Albeit, you won't be able to get 100% returns in a week, it does require trust and their is risk involved. However, I think that $VIRT is a reasonable choice given the current
market conditions.

Ididthemaths0;1522184972;87m7ae;;148;;443;"So about a month ago I lost 7k trading options and made a post on WSB.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/81j3og/suffered_some_huge_losses_this_week

The highest rated comment advised me to stop trading options since I obviously didn't know what I was doing.

I actually had 2 accounts each with about 12-14k in each them. It was my TDA account where I lost that money. The next day  though I got approved for options on RobinHood, did I learn my lesson and resist temptation? Nope, my autism runs deeper than that.

Quickly lost 8k on that account and another 3-4k on my TDA account. In total I was down to maybe 5-6k out of my initial 24-25k.

Did I learn my lesson? Nope. Took out a few thousand on a credit card cash advance to bolster my capital and spent every dollar I had and then some on more options.

Now you probably all know what's coming next, me losing the rest of my money and going into debt. Except that's not actually what happened. I spent 100% of my money on Longfin puts when it was trading above $60. Made pretty much all my money back and might even come out ahead a fair amount when it's all said and done.

TLDR: Yolo'd too hard and lost most of money , yolo'd even harder and got it all back.

alohaclaude;1522242808;87rshu;;12;;1;"I am thinking about buying the dip pretty soon and some of my favorite long stocks are on sale. Also a weak dollar and strong euro makes buying stocks cheap for eurofags right now.

Facebook in my opinion will be just fine because nobody with a social life is going to delete it, especially not Instagram or Whatsapp, ad revenue is still going to grow, which is the only key factor.

Google has been flat for almost a year which is ridiculous because of record revenue last year. I think YouTube will continue to grow, Android is going to be fine even if they have to pay Oracle. What I fear is a lot of competition from Alexa and Siri regarding their core Search Engine Advertising, how many nerds are still out there with a classic computer in 10 years?

Now to my biggest overrated love, Tesla. I really want them to succeed and I believe electric cars will be huge in 5 years. However I think the classic old giants like VW are not in the worst position when they leave the battery manufacturing to the chinese  and do what they do best, assemble and do classic marketing. They sold more than 10 million cars last year even though they had dieselgate... Tesla has to get their alien dreadnought manufacturing going and autonomous driving has to advance, right now I am sceptical, but believing that Elon and his crew are 10 times smarter than the rest I want to believe.

Anyway those are my thoughts, feel free to share your autism.

Also, I think the whole market is going to correct drastically in the next two years when trump has to go and the mess that's left behind has to be cleaned up. Also uncertainty before the next election will cause a bear market again like in november 2016, so maybe i should park my cash until then.";241957;Long Facebook, Google or Tesla?;

WZRDBEATS;1522260945;87u6hc;;79;;66;"Take a look at the title calls. NVDA just had their GTC keynote with Jensen Huang looking fresh AF in his classic black leather jacket. Tons of great news with just the absurd uber accident somehow dropping the stock. 

RSI is the lowest its been since December when the stock was in the 180s. 

I am apparently the only buyer today as the 15 volume so far were mine. optionsprofitcalculator cant even calculate the calls right now for some reason idk. The return on it is astronomical, true moon shot boys, just need to rally next week for the easiest 10x Ive seen.

Let me know if Im horribly mistaken and just threw 500$ into a blender. 

Edit:
To all the re-used Robinhood hate...why pay for commission on options? I have an E*TRADE account too but $7.70 every move is wasted. 

Just use finviz for fundamental and technical analysis, and Robinhood as the broker. Why spend the extra money?

Edit 2: 
So I use my own calculator that I made in excel to model the call prices. It is kind of limited and only works on one contract at a time (and it uses the actual dollar value, so 30$ instead of 0.3(x100) ). 

https://imgur.com/a/uUC8S

Take a gander. The calculator works better for more ITM calls but this is fairly accurate. The greeks are also largely accurate although my theta is wonky and Im still figuring out how to fix it. If you'd like to see more of the calc just let me know too.

chroner;1522269670;87vdhc;;22;;8;"As far as I can tell, this company got absolutely railed by Amazon. They can't compete, and have been in decline for awhile now.

I see today that they have gained 12%, and 28.9% since Mar 23.

Revenue, Gross Profit have been declining and Net Income is in the negatives and increasing. Sales are down as well.

This company is fucked, and this looks like a bit of an opportunity to me. Can someone that actually knows what they're doing tell me why I'm wrong? 

It looks like any profits they do post are going to be due to the new tax regulations, the sell-off of all their assets (thus reducing expenses), and any profits will be unsustainable as they no longer have the infrastructure to make future sales. They are focusing on smaller stores.

They have a deal with Amazon to sell kenmore appliances.

This all seems very short term to me and I am considering buying Put's on this for a few months out.

REMINDER OF RULES

* No promotion of any newsletter / education service for profit / referral or affiliate links. (May result in permeate ban)
* No discussion of penny stocks or OTC
* Do be responsible giving and taking advice.
* Do have discussions that relate to trading.
* Don't try to talk about what you don't know.
* Don't post your paper trades / RH &lt; 20k
* Don't make posts asking for a trade, IE submissions that boil down to ""&lt;ticker&gt;?"" or ""What do with $?""
* Don’t ask how options or another financial instrument works, do your own research. 
* Post asking about what you think and leading to a discussion.

REMINDER OF THE UNSPOKEN RULES

* Most of us don’t enjoy crypto. Crypto has its own sub.
* Please make high quality shit posts.
* As fellow mod u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY said, “I've been getting tired of people saying ""tendies"" and ""cucks"" and all that sort of 4chan and the_donald shit. We're wallstreet fucking bets. We have 230k subscribers. We have our OWN memes, our OWN lingo. There's no reason we should be getting sloppy ass, secondhand, shit-tier lingo like ""tendies"" and ""cucks"".
* Please don’t cross post memes and lingo. We are WS FUCKING B. (Personally, I like tendies but reuse a meme to many times and we just about killed it.
* Don’t post solely political content looking to get a rise from a random internet stranger.
* Don’t post questions that you can easily google.  

FUTURE OF WSB

* Personally, I’d love to have a paper trading competition that restarts every quarter. (Possibly on market watch.)
* Please comment some things you would like to see from the community, and the mods.

POSTS THAT I WILL BE REMOVING

* I will be doing my best to moderate this sub but I need community support. Please use the flair when applicable, as well as report posts that neglect the rules and guide lines. Reporting posts will make it much easier to find garbage posts. I will do my best to remove low quality shit posts. 

* Ps. For the love of god please put just slightly more effort into the shit posts. 
* Ps. Ps. Invite your girl to our discord, I’ve never heard a single female talk and its getting dry.

You can look at the technicals all you want, or the fundementals or whatever. All that shows me is that you're nothing but a baby boy. 

So Tesla has only made 4 cars this year, missing their production target by 100%. *Big Deal*. Oh, was a prepubescent boy was burned alive when the batteries failed? It doesn't matter. Even if their self driving software gets hacked by ISIS and all Tesla cars drive straight for Times Square. No shit off my face. Bears == Lose. None of it matters. Only one thing matters. 

Elon's **MONSTER APE COCK.**

A lot of you pretty boys think you know a thing or two since you look at P/E or Gamma or whatever. Everyone things they have a crystal ball. I don't know what any of those things are. I don't need to. I only need to know one thing. All I need to know is Elon's **WILD RHINO SHLONG**.

Now some of you ugly boys know what I'm talking about - but you don't get the picture yet - ""*bu-bu-but Bezos has a big ol' shlong too!*"". And you're right. And he's got big balls to match that 'Fire Stick' that could just fill you up to the brim with joy.  I'm sure his foreskin has more veins than my varicose grandmothers calves. As soon as his hard, throbbing head hits your prostate, you're in another dimension of bliss.

But here's the difference with Elon. Elon's got a **THORNY SATAN DICK**. It's twisty and turny, and covered in thorns, and you better believe it's gonna hurt when it goes in. When Jeff Bezos fucks you, it's a stretch alright, but it feels good. When Lisa's futa cock goes balls-deep, you feel like the prettiest girl in town. But when Elon's Musk hits you, you scream like a little monkey choir boy. He shreds up your insides like a cheese grater - but people still beg for more. And that's the difference.

Elon could burn the Gigafactory down to the ground, and shit in Ivanka Trump's mouth. It doesn't matter. At the end of the day, thousands will line up to have their hairy assholes torn asunder by his **MEGA ELEPHANT COCK**

Not sure why FB stock is up on news they're distancing themselves from ""data brokers."" Brokering data is FB's stock-in-trade, and I imagine any restrictions (self-imposed or otherwise) on this kind of activity will dampen future earnings. 

But I suppose a plausible alternative interpretation is that buyers see this as a sign FB's is repositioning itself so that Legislature-critters the world over won't positively shit down their throats with new privacy and data-selling restriction statutes and regs, which might signal bottom has been met.

felixfff;1522338699;882d3f;;115;;137;"So back in the summer of 2007 i was a bright eyed and bushy tailed 18 year old, fresh out of freshman year of college. I didn't have a worry in the world, and neither did anyone else, as every Joe the Plumber could get a jumbo mortgage and buy his dream $700k home in las vegas with an adjustable rate NINJA mortgage. 

One of my college buddies took a family trip to cancun that summer. He was like 5'8, balding but otherwise hairy, with a medium build. He managed to get seduced by a (as described by him) 230lb behemoth who took him back to her place for some good ol unprotected sex a few of the nights.

Anyway - she worked at Goldman. During pillow talk one night, she mentioned that he should stay away from investing in Bear Stearns - they wouldn't be around for much longer. 

He relayed that onto me because he knew i was a budding investing autist. I scoffed at it (but had no money to invest anyway). At that point, Bear was $140 a share and a wall street titan. Even as the first signs of the financial crisis began to pop up, it seemed silly that Bear would be impacted to a greater degree than anyone else - and surely they'd never go bankrupt. 

Fast forward to the spring of 2008 and bear basically went bankrupt and got sold to JPM for the pity price of $10/share. 

So what's that got to do with anything (other than maybe it's a good idea to fuck a fat chick on vacation to get insider info)?

Clearly there's a crisis of confidence regarding TSLA. Shares are down $100 (30%) in less than a month. Bond prices have fallen off a cliff and yields have risen. TSLA is pretty much structurally bankrupt (and always has been) and the stock price was always based on elon's cokedreams, but it seems as though the smart money has had enough of elon's shit. 

Soon, M3 depositors will ask for money back, suppliers will ask for better terms (up to potential up-front payment), and cash will dry up. Solar City is a moneyhole that TSLA has to keep funding. TSLA has already securitized and sold off pretty much anything it can (solar city / tesla future revenue streams). TSLA already played the AP game last quarter in order to generate cash flow - can't do that again. They can't really tap the debt market any more with the current bond prices implying that any further raise would happen at 8%+ interest rates. They maybe can still sell a little equity, but that will only further show that the jig is up.

So follow the smart money that's already been selling stock and bonds and get the fuck out of TSLA (and buy puts). maybe not today - there's some chance elon pulls a rabbit out of his hat regarding Q1 M3 deliveries and there's a bit of a relief rally and shares retrace towards $300. But the M3's being produced right now are shit - all over the internet there are pictures of people being asked to take delivery of cars that wouldn't pass a Kia quality control inspection. There will be endless replacements and warranty claims until TSLA just gives up and rolls over.

I'd expect to see TSLA below $200 within a month, below $100 within 6 months, and perhaps in restructuring talks within a year.

Bloomberg's production model projects 2k M3s per week within 2 weeks.

So sure, this isn't 2500 per week by end of March. 2k per week at $45k per car is still over $1 billion more revenue per quarter than they made last year. If you look at the week over week increase in Bloomberg's production model, the production rate is growing exponentially. And accelerating faster since the line shutdown in February for equipment upgrades.

They might not be at 2500/week, but they're pretty close and I'm betting the farm that they'll meet or exceed 5k by end of Q2. This selloff is a huge opportunity.

I like this cage because it offers variation in ring size so I can adjust accordingly to fit my magnum(ish) dong, as well as the ability to piss effectively, an actual feature listed on the website.

Now here is the important part: I will NOT, under ANY circumstance mail the key to a mod: too much risk. What if they lose the key? What if it gets lost en route to the mod? I don't wanna fuck with that shit.

HOWEVER, I will place the key inside a Piggy-Bank Like device. During every livestream I intend to do I will destroy the Piggy Bank like device and recover the key, to show that I have not used it in between livestreams. I may use an actual piggy bank, or a sealed envelope, whichever serves the function of proof I have not massaged my penis with my hands.


I am moving out of my current house right now, so I am extra busy and unable to do any livestreams this week; but next week is when I will have gained back more free time, therefore I will be able to show you degenerate fucks how I am dedicated to this NoFap challenge. I said I would do this, so I hope the level of proof I provide will be enough.
