Amurphy747;1622592136;nq8d3t;DD;41;;1;"Hello fellow autists, 

I have an opportunity you will love in a sector that is not covered as much as it should be. The diagnostic medicine sector is booming and with crazy advances in technology is growing exponentially and by getting into the industry leaders now the gains will be immaculate. 

Exact Sciences Corp. (EXAS) is the play. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the company and what do they do?**  They are a molecular diagnostics company specializing in the detection of early stage cancers. The company's initial focus was on the early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer and in 2014 it launched Cologuard the first stool DNA test for colorectal cancer. 

Cologuard is the only stool-DNA screening test for detecting colon cancer that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It looks for changes in your DNA that could indicate the presence of colon cancer or precancerous polyps that might be present in your colon. **Cologuard is gaining popularity because it‚Äôs far less invasive, and more convenient, than the traditional** **colonoscopy** **test.**

You've probably seen their commercials about where you shit in the box and the mail man has to pick it up and send it to the lab. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Recognize it now from TV?](https://preview.redd.it/yjw50kptlq271.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ada1cb21b69b7e814f345079960b03f9b430076)

**Why Cologuard?** 

Right now the company if it can capture just a 10% share of the projected $30 billion U.S. pan-cancer liquid biopsy market it would double revenue. With Exact one of two companies actively pursuing the market, there is potential to gain a significantly larger slice of the pie. And by them having a product that caters to potentially every 50+ year old that is less invasive and is easy as shitting in a box it will be easier. Plus all you gay bears out there, your buttholes after getting fucked in the biggest bull market will be real stretched out to fill those boxes when you're ready.

 The market is underestimating Cologuard‚Äôs staying power. It could take years for liquid biopsy to steal share, and Cologuard‚Äôs market share could soar past 10%. 

Their competitor is if a future liquid bioposy is made which could be more convenient but the technology still is not there yet and ether way they are making their own. A liquid biopsy works by detecting tumor DNA that has broken free of the cancer and is circulating in the blood and, to a lesser extent, has collected in the urine. 

Exact is positioned for growth regardless of how liquid biopsy plays out, and the firm‚Äôs pan-cancer initiative is a good hedge in case Cologuard feels competitive pressures. The 

The firm is moving to other types of cancers now including lung cancer which all the kids who vaped will be getting early diagnosis and their lives saved while we make tendies. 

Conclusion: This company has crazy technology involving DNA stability, biomarker detection, hemoglobin detection/stability. You may not know anything I am saying but I took organic chem in college and made an A so I know maybe only one percent more then you cause I am a fellow autist too, but this shit is going to the moon. The healthcare sector is growing and technology is advancing and insurance companies are going to be paying for this by the shitload (No pun included). This sector is undervalued and under watched. Instead Shitty companies like Nikola and Ridestown motors that are gonna go out of business are taking air time on CNBC instead of this innovative company that only trades at a 18 billion dollar market cap that has multiple products, fighting multiple cancers, patents, and a much larger market share to grow into.

**Every Wall Street Analyst who covers this sector has a positive price target for this company ranging using the ETRADE analyst research tab. It is currently trading at $108 and the PT range from 115$ (6% upside) to 170.00$ (57% upside)**. Because this stock is literally investing in the act of shitting in a box it automatically gets a meme boost from wall street analysts so just add 20% more to that. 

And because gay bears who are tired of getting fucked in the ass will no longer want a coloscopy they will go to cologuard.

Weekly Timeframe - bear porn (i'm not calling top or CrAsH) - Just pointing out major levels here. We do have some upside potential still.

* I did point out a healthy correction bearish pt since iNfLaTiON is still on everyone's mind. This does not indicate that I'm calling a cRaSh!!!
* Major downside levels or thereabouts

MrSweetPickles;1622594259;nq91qz;DD;0;;1;"# This is my personal opinion based on a number of observations.

Key facts are the following:

AMC short position is much cheaper to close than GME short position

AMC and GME have been linked since this whole saga began

Hedgies/MM have finally accepted they are fuk and want to limit damage.

How will they limit damage? It has finally become apparent today, they intend on using the above key facts to their advantage. We must spread the word that this is what is happening so as to prevent massive FUD and sell offs. Now what is happening?

First check the volumes of GME and AMC today.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fxh9fz40r271.png?width=2382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=631d865e29993123c1989bf2e53ae0fe26a817ff

Notice anything interesting? AMC volume is massive, around half of what it was during the last rise earlier this year. How does GME compare? GME volume is practically NOTHING. AMC rising massively while GME rising only a little.

Why is this important? I believe they are closing their AMC short positions right now. They significantly increased closing of positions today in order to end the squeeze as fast and cheap as possible. They will close all of their short positions (or most) and then short AMC from the top. They will additionally short GME at AMC peak in an attempt to make GME look like its crashing along AMC.

The headlines will read ""The meme stocks are FINISHED, the retail has won! WOOHOO Gais, its over!' and try to say GME 'already ran!' Meanwhile they will be opening more short positions in an attempt to crash GME as AMC continues to crash. They will try to crash GME as much as possible during this phase in order to be able to close their much more expensive and larger short positions in GME for cheap.

This is all my opinion, but look into volumes yourself, this all makes sense and would be the 'smart move' if you were a hedgie that was getting apes sticking bananas in their tailpipe.";10241837;$AMC squeeze has begun, $GME has not yet.

Trippikomodo;1622595868;nq9kg5;Discussion;2;;1;"Wallstreet analyst and Wallstreet media have been writing the rules on what a stock should be worth forever now. The analyst and media put out price targets for stocks in favor of the institutions and hedgefunds all while retail has to play by their rules. Now the tables have turned and they are not happy about it. AMC is now owned by retail, think about that for a second. We are now the institution for this stock and we own the float. It is like DFV said with gamestop in the congressional hearings, Major players have teams of paid analysts and they are the ones who decide what the value of a stock is and big funds can manipulate the prices in their favor because they had access to large sums of capital. Now with the internet all of that is changing. With everyone who has come together and holding in these stocks the capital of retail is that of some of these large players in the game. So now some of their partners are under water with this because OUR analysis is different then theirs, they are fighting back with trash information and pulling every trick out of the book to try and sway people to sell so they can regain control of the narrative. I think people are waking up to this and see that retail now has access to be able to write the narrative and at some point wallstreet players will have to stop fighting it and understand that retail can decide what a company should be worth. 

Now to why this a fundamental play IMO. With Several AMC theatres now opened back up and AMC knocking numbers of its debts the company has the opportunity to really change its whole dynamic. For them to say its a dying business it cant come back its going bankrupt or share price is overvalued, ect is an outlandish statement. No one knows for sure but I can bet that AMC adapts to changes and that it will continue to grow through new opportunities that arise. The CEO seems to be onboard now with the movement and sees that people are taking this seriously. If retail continues to hold down the float and buying pressure continues, the shorts remain under water. Essentially the float becomes less and less the more people continue to hold, buy, average up, exercise calls ect. So long as there is no dilution the stock will become more and more volatile because if the majority of the float is held, it will trade like a low float stock (very fast up and down movements). Add the short covering to this and you have a share price thats going to go up no matter what so long as the float is held down. Shorts really have two options at this point. They can buy back shares gradually which will inevitably cause share price to gradually rise so long as everyone is still holding, or they can take the L and start buying back large blocks which is going to cause the share price to moon more violently and the amount of available shares to own will become less and less, further increasing the chances of major price fluctuations. Add possible phantom shares to the mix and/or margin calls you are talking an incredible price rise. We still dont know the numbers but I foresee the share price of this actually flying. We are just in the beginning of it all in my opinion. There is alot of other underlying factors as well. Higher share prices ultimately longer term will be extremely beneficial to the company as they will be able to raise more capital through offerings, ect. This is a no brainer. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice but for me I like the stock and I believe good things are coming for the sharehodlers and the company. With new SEC rules coming to fruition, the share count, the true reality of it all is coming to light. Im curious to know what everyones holdings are, if only we had a verifiable way to start the share count ourselves or if anybody has any suggestions how we could do this, because I have a feeling numbers are going to be fixed. Either way the reality is starting to sink in with people. Good Luck fellow hodlers.";10242110;AMC does have fundamentals forget the paid analyst, we are built different.;1.0

sstobo;1622596478;nq9rfq;DD;1;;1;"Hello friends! **Heres the TLDR first:**

**$GOED is at $2.10**, **up 14%** as of writing this, after hours on Tuesday. I believe it will not stop until it hits **$4-5** dollars. This will most likely happen in a very short period of time.

Id imagine everyone is a bit pre-occupied with the meme explosion right now, but there is another play gaining a lot of momentum.

Last Thursday (the 27th of May) during after hours, the online appliance retailer, Goedeker (GOED), saw their share price go from **$4.30 to $16.83.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bxti266b6r271.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba5cf81b0d85ef02cd903674e938b9775f465eb8

&amp;#x200B;

The stock traded around **$6** for a day, then overnight a **90m** share offering, and an equal amount of warrants, being sold to the public at a price of **$2.25** was announced. [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210527005936/en/1847-Goedeker-Announces-Pricing-of-205-Million-Public-Offering](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210527005936/en/1847-Goedeker-Announces-Pricing-of-205-Million-Public-Offering) \--- read about the offering here

This led to an **absolutely brutal dip** overnight - from **$6 to $1.85.**

https://preview.redd.it/h64910f66r271.png?width=1036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=979c0cd1c47a82b7976c055bbdecf3540572ca83

The offering was to raise cash to purchase the company 'Appliances Connection'. Volume on Friday as the offering was hoovered up was almost 8x normal (90m or so). Volume today 4x (60m).

Now this is interesting, since the stock has never traded below $4 until now, so that leads me to believe that this volume was the offering being scooped up. Someone holding bags from $4 + is most likely not unloading at this price, given the volatility.

Now these aren't two shitty business's! Take a look first at their sitejabber reviews:

And now look at this article reporting on their last earnings:

[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/1847-goedeker-appliances-connection-announce-132700308.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/1847-goedeker-appliances-connection-announce-132700308.html)

TLDR for that: ***Goedeker and Appliances Connection Announce Record First Quarter 2021 Results with Combined Revenue of $123M, Pro Forma Net Income of $13M and Adjusted EBITDA of $14.7M.***

**These are both well regarded, profitable companies!**

Now im not as experienced as many people on this sub, so i would love help calculating this:

**GOED market cap listed at $16.85m.**

**GOED Adjusted EBITDA is $14.7m**

**Combined Revenue of $123M**

EV/Revenue: 1.38 is the median in the retail / home appliances sector. **GOED is trading at .11!**

EV/EBITDA 13.69 is the median in the retail / home appliances sector **GOED is trading at -0.46!!!!!**

I would love some help figuring out a PT, but by either of these metrics, GOED is an easy 8 bagger if it rises to match the average of its peers.

**PT: $6 - short term at minimum a return to its pre-offering price of $6.**

**BULL PT:** **$20 EOY This stock trades with is peers value multiple-wise,**

**BEAR PT: Warrants are all executed at $2.25, people lose interest, stock hangs at $2.25 until people lost interest in the company.**

Finally: My position:

Last week and today AMC has had a very good rally, but this is just the beginning, now let me tell you why. (I know finance can be dense and complicated so i'll try to keep it simple)

# TLDR

\- There's a lot of options between 30 and 40 being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares causing a Gamma Squeeze today and after hours. If more large option volume is placed tomorrow between 40-50 the Gamma Squeeze will keep going. 

\- Short holders will lose a lot of money as share price continues up, forcing them to buy more AMC to close their position sometime through the week. 

\- üöÄüåëüöÄüåëüöÄüåë

# DD

The past few weeks have been great for meme stocks, but AMC is leading at the frontline of this rally outperforming the others like GME, BB, etc, boasting a 112% increase the past week. One of the reasons i've been able to hold confidence in, is AMC's option volume. A call is a promise to sell you 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. Behind this contract, are people called Market Makers. These are people sitting at Wallstreet, writing contracts for people to buy options if there is a lack of supply. Now let's look at the option chain for today expiring next week

[Weekly call options from yahoo finance](https://preview.redd.it/4k3vjjb70r271.jpg?width=1327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0358dcc16a0a79ffbb1bbc292969a0c4f035494b)

If we look at the 3rd column from the right, that's the current volume of call options. Whenever people buy options, in order for market makers to minimize as much risk as possible, they buy stock in order to stay ""delta neutral"". Fancy phrase I know. A very basic explanation is that no matter where the stock moves, the market makers don't lose money. Their goal isn't to bet against you, their goal is to scalp the bid/ask margins. Now notice how the option volume is particularly high at 30, 35, and 40. As the price moves closer to these strike prices, market makers got to buy more shares in order to stay delta neutral. Now with this high volume, market makers need to buy **A LOT** more shares everytime the price goes up, which then snowballs larger and larger causing something called a ""Gamma squeeze"", which basically means STONK GO UP. Last week a similar phenomenon occured, now we can see it will especially rally up at the 30 (which it did), 35(which it did), and 40 mark (soon to come). Once we get closer to 40 hopefully tomorrow there will be more options being placed in order for the Gamma squeeze to continue, but until then we have the next phase.... the famous.... short squeeze...

Gamma squeeze is caused by an incrementation of options being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares to minimize their risk. Now that we've hit this point, the price has gone up a lot. Today alone AMC went up 40%. And. that. is. big. oh. no. to. short holders. Short holders are holding AMC to profit off of AMC to go down, luckily for us, these guys have not learnt their lesson! With AMC mooning from the Gamma squeezes, short holders will be hard red and and are **forced** to close out of their short position, requiring them to buy AMC driving the price up even further! This is what brought GME to it's peak of 400$/share. If we look at the short interest a month ago. 

[Last month short interest from Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/2k2ey4k64r271.jpg?width=1180&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ab47fb7e917b0fb861253378e6f95c613cf080a)

We can see here AMC was 20% shorted. Through the month short holders continued to close more and more causing AMC to go up and up. This drove the value higher and higher, and now AMC is busting 38$/share. Now notice that cute little tick at the bottom.

We can see here AMC short interest dropped to 16% but it looks like these short holders are doubling down and are increasing their short position. Today alone we busted 40% increase in AMC, if we can keep going we can make short holders force to close and climb even higher heights. 16-20% doesn't seem like much, but doing the math.... 

Total shares in circulation = 448m ([taken from yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics/))

Float % = 18% (paid ortex subscription as shown above)

Shares shorted = 80.6million

80.6 \* 37$ (current AMC share value at the time of writing) = $2.983b

.... needed to buy AMC. And that's before the AMC rocket takes off, it'll be even more while the rocket flies. So if any of you need any extra re-assurance, or a reason to put more money in, here ya go. If you guys want to continue the Gamma Squeeze, keep in mind the price needs momentum to carry up. Don't buy ridiculously far out call options like 70s or 80s because that won't give the stock an opportunity to climb up the 40s-60s range. It needs to be an incremental climb.

# Reversal

I'd be bs'ing you if i didn't say that this could go horribly wrong. The narrative i explained isn't **guaranteed to work**. In the case of bad news, or a large sell off, this can cause the price to fall or halt. Then the Gamma squeeze can't be sqoze which will then prevent the Short squeeze. Another point to keep in mind is we don't know **exactly** when the short holders will cover. They can double down and wait us out, but if we can keep the Gamma squeeze going, they'll have to close. To hold shorts you must pay a premium of [10%](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) every year to hold onto the shorts. This fee can increase though, and it has been steadily increasing as the price continues to go up. Please don't bet more than you can lose in case of these events. As for me, i'm waking up at market open tomorrow and yolo'ing the rest of my 10k into more call options before the rocket blasts.  üöÄüöÄüöÄüåëüåëüåë";10242343;Why AMC is rallying and why it will CONTINUE rallying üöÄüåë;1.0

Nobody was rallying to save GameStop, the failing specialized pawn shop notorious for ripping off customers, before there was a chance for them to profit off of it. 


Nobody was rallying around AMC, a failing movie theater chain, until they saw the stock was volatile and they could gamble to make money off the share price. 


Nostalgia through rose tinted glasses is not some uniting cause for saving poorly managed companies that are somehow looked back upon as the cornerstones of society. It is an emotional plea for confirmation bias and occasionally an attempt to pump and dump.

Stop loss under **40.00**

**Position -** NIO 45 Call @ 2.11

\---

What's up guys - with $EEM breaking out big I've been looking at a rotation into Chinese stocks and one I always keep on my radar is **$NIO.**

It was working on a gorgeous **descending wedge** for about three months - and broke out just today:

[$NIO 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/afewbvmcpr271.png?width=2238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34d4473f4a2335b68e65e1ae07a48f0d89f5d2d0)

The main price targets for this setup are **47.23, 49.86** and it should take about 2 weeks - 1 month to play out. $NIO is a fast moving stock so you can expect a move sooner rather than later.

I also want to be mindful of some resistance @ **43.51 -** breaking this would provide a nice foothold to tag those higher targets.

The only support below is sitting at **40.00 -** below there I'll be stopping out (daily close).

Lastly - we got a nice uptick in volume today which is always a good sign on a breakout candle.

GME, aka granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, is a condition in dogs where they get inflammatory lesions in their brain and nervous system. Sadly, these dogs don't do well and end up not surviving (this disease is not a joke and is very serious). Learning of this condition got me thinking, is GME in dogs a predictor of $GME in the stock market? Did this terrible disease predict that $GME would give us brain lesions and make us smooth-brained apes? Were our brains meant to be smooth all along? Is this a sign from the gods? The only answers I could decide on is that this must mean that the current $GME debacle was destined to happen, and that it would be lead by smooth-brained apes and would bring the downfall of the hedgies and significant scientific research. 

On another note, granulomatous menigoencephalomyelitis was first discovered in 1978, which is exactly 6 years before Gamestop was founded. And do you know what else there are 6 of? Infinity stones. So this must mean that $GME is going to infinity. 

Also, I am unfortunately not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

Big mega HF is manipulating the shit out of the market to suck up money for years and even now when the gig is up they are pulling every string, calling every favour, trying every trick, bending or breaking every rule, just to draw things out as long as possible. What happens when the GME price starts to rise, and these guys just executive salary bonus themselves as much money as they have left then ""LOL, Bankrupt, TTYL""? Does everyone else but them lose? If they are using this time to divert and drain their assets to other things, enrich themselves personally to the max before the inevitable call, then just roll belly up before the final launch, who pays? Do all the retail buyers get stuck with the loss?
