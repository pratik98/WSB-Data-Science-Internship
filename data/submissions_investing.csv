I'm looking to try out the BRRRR (R's variable) investment approach, but something doesn't make sense...

What about the Debt to Income ratio?  Shouldn't this shut the Brrrr down in 2 transactions?  

So lets try Brrrr:

I buy a house Cash $120k and Hold.  Renovate brings it up to $160k.  Rent will be variable depending on location.  Refinance at 80% $128k cashout, now have a loan but tenant in place. Repeat.

-------
Now it seems that if I repeat, I'll have 2 loans.  Repeat again, 3 loans.  How is a bank going to approve me with 3 mortgages?  Will the tenant rent income factor enough to lower the DTI?  How strong is Airbnb income?

InvestingLifeSavings;1514838093;7nhc2r;Discussion;156;;88;"Looking at AAPLs fundamentals and the pile of cash they are about to be sitting on due to the tax bill makes me think AAPL might be a good investment moving forward. The valuation is also excellent relative to other popular companies. Here's why I don't want to put my money in just yet.

The biggest risk I see is that 70% of Apple's revenue comes from iPhone sales. I think iPhones are great, in fact I'm typing this on my iPhone right now. The iPhone X is too expensive and there has been bad publicity surrounding iPhone batteries lately which could eat into their sales numbers. Selling at over $1000 is a deal breaker for me and I would strongly consider taking my business to Samsung if it was time for a new phone. I can only imagine other consumers must feel the same way.

Additionally, part of the reason the company is so profitable is because the profit margins on iPhones are huge at about 60%. Apple is clearly a master of marketing and maintaining a strong customer base. I worry that the next time there's an economic downturn, no one is going to be able to afford these luxury products and Apple will have to drastically lower its profit margins in order to stay competitive. Additionally, there may be new, cheap smartphones which may not be as powerful as an iPhone, but gets the job done. I'm thinking like how an amazon fire 7 for $50 is expected to compete with the Apple iPad for $300+. 

Lastly and least importantly, looking at the max history of the AAPL stock price charts shows that the company tends to fall out of favor for long periods of time every few years. I don't know much about technical analysis, but based on recent news it seems like the company could be at a turning point once again. 

I really do want to invest in this company based on the amount of cash they'll be sitting on for reinvestment, the amount of cash that continues pouring in, and the strength of the brand name, but for these reasons I feel like I shouldn't.

InvestingLifeSavings;1514858503;7njclm;Discussion;108;;19;"The most common and popular investing advice I see is ""just buy an index fund."" That probably works for a lot of people who want to save for retirement and just forget about it. The whole idea of an ETF doesn't make sense to me, and is kind of boring. Here's why I think that:

If you're buying something like SPY, you're paying State Street Corp to buy a bunch of stocks of the ""strongest companies."" Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it is my understanding that the index automatically allocates capital to all of the s&amp;p 500, in proportion to market caps. So theoretically, companies that are overvalued are being allocated more capital than companies that are not. 

This whole system offers an explanation to how overvalued companies can just continue to become more overvalued while I sit here in confusion. I also wonder what will happen when everyone saving for retirement in these ETFs wants out at the same time. Savers better hope the market doesn't collapse near retirement or take adequate measures to prevent significant loss. 

To me, buying an etf takes all the fun out of  investing. It's challenging scrounging data and figuring out what companies are strong and here to stay and grow. I can see the appeal of an ETF though, being risk averse or not interested in stock picking, or just not having time for that. It is not without its downsides though.

Santo_R;1514860036;7njhkm;;19;;2;"I’m going to open up a TFSA (gains are tax sheltered) soon. I’m a university student, and don’t need the money anytime soon. Although I have a higher tolerance to risk, it still somewhat bothers me that I’d be investing at a market high. My main thought would be to probably allocate most of my portfolio into SPY, and maybe a stock or 2 that I really like. But here’s my dilemma: if the market declines, SPY will obviously decline. 

I know that individual stocks are inherently more risky, especially during a market decline. I was thinking that I could comprise a portfolio of maybe 5-10 solid, blue chip, dividend paying stocks (off the top of my head I’m thinking Apple or J&amp;J). Although I’m looking for appreciation, I’m also taking into consideration that if the market declines, I won’t have much appreciation. My logic is that even though the market is in a decline, I’d still be making some money from dividends. Further, the dividend return would be greater than a bond, or high interest savings account. Plus, I’d still own a stock that could appreciate. 

I’d still like to make some money if the market declines, but I’d be planning to hold no matter what (and hold for a long time). So, are my options pretty much the same? Either go all in SPY or split between 5-10 blue chip dividend stocks, in terms of overall return (dividend and appreciation)?
I don’t mean to sound like that guy, but for now I’d like to assume that a market decline will eventually happen,

On a side note, I heard someone say that they were heavily taxed (more than usual) on their investments in American stocks (as a Canadian) because of some new tax change? Does that sound familiar at all? I don’t keep up with news too much, especially American politics.

The NSE, set up in 1992, is the new kid on the block. it has only about 1,800 listings but a market cap equal to the BSE and is the 12^th largest exchange globally. It's roughly the equal of the NASDAQ is the sense that it has always been a more technologically advanced exchange.

Several thousand companies are listed and trade on both exchanges which makes for some interesting arbitrage opportunities sometimes as NSE also has far more participants and it's price moves tend to be sharper and and ahead of the BSE in some instances but equally susceptible to price anomalies due to investor activity.

Volume wise, any stock with a listing on both exchanges is going to see more trading activity on the NSE than the BSE but this difference is going away slowly.

Their Indices:

The BSE is dominated by older companies, which is obvious since it had a 140 year start on the NSE and was the only exchange on which to list for that time. 

However, given the nature of the Indian market where a handful of companies dominate the market cap and volume tables, the two exchanges have benchmark indices of a fairly small number of stocks:

- BSE Sensex: 30 components. Constructed and managed now by S&amp;P
- NSE Nifty: 50 components. Constructed and managed by IISL which is a NSE subsidiary

The Sensex is [dominated by Financials](https://imgur.com/Hq2LyvQ) which is mostly attributable to HDFC and ICICI which are 2 of the largest private sector banks in the country. The next 2 largest sectors are Consumer Discretionary and Energy but he drop from #1 to #2 is massive.

The Nifty 50 is [also dominated by the Banks](https://imgur.com/xemMHuv) though to a lesser degree than the Sensex (27% vs 40%). The subsequent sectors are different however with Computer software taking the #2 spot. 

There are multiple ETF's which follow wither index and trade on international exchanges. INDY, for example, is a Nifty etf.

that's all for now. In the next post, I will get into the different sectors with respect to the companies, dispersion and fundamental performance over time.";;"Primer on the Indian markets: part 1 - ""The Exchanges, their indices and volumes""";

See here: https://www.riotblockchain.com/about/management-team

The first pump-and-dump incident was under the name AspenBio:
https://www.denverpost.com/2011/01/14/aspenbio-battling-investors-lawsuits/

CFO of AspenBio, Jeffrey McGonegal, was awarded a bit under $290k in stock options in just 2009 off of that pump and dump scheme (probably a lot more over the years of the now-defunct company's existence). 

Investors sued in 2011 (see: http://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1045/APPY10_01/2011823_r01c_11CV00165.pdf). Jeffrey G. McGonegal is personally named in the lawsuit.

After years of delay, a judge dismissed the lawsuit, despite misleading statements being made by AspenBio executives, and countless smaller investors losing money. The case was also dismissed despite AspenBio's management team personally profiting heavily due to these poorly informed investments.

Then again, in 2015, after AspenBio was renamed to Venaxis, just 2 defendants were individually named in another lawsuit involving the then re-branded firm:
http://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1053/VI00_01/201522_f01c_15CV00222.pdf

The two individually named defendants were Stephen Lundy and Jeffrey McGonegal. This lawsuit was over a separate pump-and-dump scandal involving Venaxis, and its shares falling from $2.04 to $0.55 on January 29th due to damaging information.

The complaint states: ""Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the APPY1 510(k) submission and the Company’s future prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the APPY1 test failed to meet the criteria for “substantial equivalence” based upon data and information submitted by Venaxis in its 510(k) submission; (2) the Company lacked a reasonable basis to conclude that the results from the APPY1 pivotal study were sufficient to support FDA clearance; and as a result of the foregoing, (3) Venaxis’ public statements pertaining to the expected FDA clearance of its 510(k) submission were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.""

Founder and CEO Rick Smith has said ""we are committed to executing in this next stage of growth with more rigorous focus on profitability"".

Previously the company has been highly successful in whatever it has set out to achieve. When it developed the Taser it cornered the market.  With wearable cameras and software it quickly built a big lead over competitors. 

Now that its focus is on building profitability we should expect quick results.  Police departments are reluctant to change provider for such high profile products meaning big margins look achievable. 

With a market cap of $1.4 bn Axon Enterprises is trading on a multiple of almost 4 time revenues - not cheap.  

But with a total addressable market estimated at €6.5bn, Axon has a long runway of growth ahead and should expect to grow much larger.  25% growth is expected this year and fast growth looks set to continue.  Add in the new focus on profitability and the SP could be on its way higher.

InvestingLifeSavings;1514945152;7nrela;Discussion;26;;0;"Recently I stumbled upon this article: https://www.sprottmoney.com/Blog/for-clues-on-the-economy-follow-the-money-dave-kranzler.html

Propaganda is out there stating the US economy is booming and the future is bright, but this author shows a FRED chart indicating the amount of loans being given out by institutions is stagnating. This happened both in 2001 and in 2008 and is happening now. 

Is this an adequate indicator of a potential market collapse? I don't know. There are other indicators such as the unemployment rate, the schiller P/E, the delusion that ""this time it's different,"" as mentioned in the article, the flattening of the yield curve, the rejection of value investing, and others that come up in my radar as clear warning signs.  

So if I'm bearish on stocks what is an adequate hedge against a downturn? Bonds yields are minuscule so that's a no go. Some people are holding cash, but that seems risky to me. As the price of healthcare, higher education, assets and other ""luxury"" goods skyrocket, you can sleep safely at night knowing there is not enough inflation according to the FED. I think the dollar is going to deflate heavily in the coming years, due to the increasing federal deficit, the tax bill effectively giving consumers and businesses a raise, and the maintenance of loose monetary policy. All these factors, which have consequences and are tools for stimulating the economy when it's depressed, are being used at a time of economic prosperity. 

If bonds are yielding nothing, stocks are at dangerously high levels, and the US dollar is likely going to deflate (and it already is relative to other currencies), where's the safest spot for your wealth? Maybe TIPs? I don't really have the answers but at least now I understand why all these speculators are jumping into bitcoin. For now though, the majority of my portfolio is still in the market.

As many know, the ""everything bubble"" has been a common term that has been thrown around recently. This ""bubble"" (regardless of if you believe it's actually a bubble) is essentially a product of the low interest rates that have been prevalent for years. 

I see a lot of questions about very *specific* debt issues such as subprime auto, or student loan debt. The general consensus is that each of these potential bubbles is not big enough by itself to cause harm to the economy even if it does come crashing down a little bit. But I can't help but feel like people are looking at things in much too narrow of a manner. The people focusing on subprime auto issues aren't taking into consideration how the rise in student loan debt has been squeezing people over the last decade. They aren't looking at how credit card debt in tandem with the above two issues (and mortgages) will cause a ton of issues as interest rates rise.

**Shouldn't we be looking at aggregate consumer debt more when discussing smaller bubbles?**

I'm sure I'm not the only one, but is anybody concerned more about aggregate consumer debt? Sure, a bubble in subprime auto-loans may not be by itself large enough to topple an economy, but what happens when you add that to higher than ever credit card debt, higher than ever student loan debt, and still relevant mortgage debt? 

People are so quick to write off anything like 2008 from happening again since mortgage debt hasn't risen, yet looking at the charts, it just seems that the debt has transferred from mortgages to student loans, credit cards, and auto loans. After all, does it really matter *where* the debt comes from? It's the simple fact that increased overall debt leads to increased defaulting and a slower economy as the economy tightens. 

**We have more debt than 2008, yet median household income is nearly the same**

We are past the point where we have more household debt than we did in 2007-2008 (https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html), and this is likely going to continue rising. In 2008, this obviously caused an enormous recession, so shouldn't there be more concern that we are already past that # in aggregate? Now, many people here are going to be quick to point out that this was over 10 years ago, and wages and other similar numbers are better. But here is the thing, median household income is only a hair's breadth higher than it was in 2008. Given, it has been rising as well, but It's only slightly (1.5%) higher than it was in 2007, while debt is more than that at this point. So how is it that the aggregate debt to median household income isn't more of a concern for more people?

I've been reading up on stuff and from what I've seen I've decided to go with M1 Finance using their pie system.  So I've got my pie setup where I have picked two pie slices, one is a retire by 2055 aggressive at 70% and one is a retire by 2055 conservative at 30%.

Barron's article largely follows this thinking but says the upside is probably limited to 25% due to concerns about over saturation of the TV business (Display Technologies) which is a primary driver of Corning's revenues and earnings.

It is true that several fabs are coming into operation this year.  However in total the new fabs are exected to add just 3% to overall capacity and a new report from TrendForce subsidiary WitsView now forecasts that LCD displays, ie televisions, will probably rebound in 2018 with sales of 218 million units representing a 4% increase.

rimlogger;1515034164;7nzz8d;;39;;116;"I work as a state government auditor. Recently, my office has been working on an operational audit of the state's pension fund. Our audit was primarily focused on operations at the fund (i.e., examination of the organization's internal control structure, review of various non-investing operating procedures, etc.).

Today, I had the pleasure of interviewing the CIO of the fund. He had worked for some local hedge funds for over 25 years before coming to the state pension fund as a CIO. He has a CFA, and worked as an electrical engineer before turning to finance.

After I asked all of the audit-related questions I had, I decided to spin the conversation over to investing. He was more than happy to oblige. He stressed that he was an investor, not a trader. Here are a few takeaways from our conversation:

1. One cannot predict what's going to happen a year from now in general.
2. The equity markets are overly complacent right now and while expensive, are not as expensive as they were in 2000. There are still bargains out there, but plenty of value traps too.
3. He has not seen volatility this low ever in his entire career. He feels that the market is dramatically underpricing the possibility of a geopolitical shock or natural disasters that might cascade upon one another. To him, the VIX is unnaturally low right now, and he believes that it will eventually revert to the its past mean if a geopolitical shock comes to fruition.
4. For anyone with a sizable portfolio, it's important to buy assets uncorrelated with the equity market. The state pension fund cut its equity allocation from 49% to 40% over the past few years for this reason and instead has focused more efforts on identifying good investments in real estate and private equity.
5. He's bullish on land and agriculture. The state pension fund recently bought an interest in an agricultural cooperative that produces blueberries for harvest.
6. He readily admits that he has underperformed the market in his personal portfolio. But given that the guy is over 60 years old, he may be more concerned with capital preservation than most people.
7. He is a big fan of Andy Grove, one of the founders of Intel. He considers Intel the precursor to what Silicon Valley is today. He recommended that I read his two books, ""Only the Paranoid Survive"" and ""High Output Management"".";;Interviewed the CIO at a state pension fund recently.

Recently paid off a ton of student loan debt (yay me). I was living comfortable with the student loans payments and the mortgage payment but now I’m not sure what’s the best thing to do with the new cash flow.

1) take exactly what I was paying for student loans and start applying it to my mortgage payment. Obviously I would save a ton of money on interest and with a rough calc would pay my mortgage off in ten years

2) take exactly what I was paying for my student loans and put it towards investments. This is where I think it gets tricky. 

Would I make more money in the markets than I’m saving on my mortgage? I keep thinking of the multiplier effect and maybe initially it wouldn’t work out but 20 years from now is it better to just pay my messily interest rate of 4% and let my investments grow?

3) the most tempting option. Do not pay mortgage and do not invest. Save it all for 5ish maybe 10 years and open my own business. Honestly can’t see myself working at 60years old. I plan to retire early and this is probably the best chance at that. 

Student loans were 1k a month. Mortgage is 2k.

InvestingLifeSavings;1515044017;7o0vx7;Discussion;2;;0;"Viacom is currently valued at $12B, trades at an EV/EBITDA of 3 and a p/e of 7. On the surface this stock looks amazing. So why has it bottomed out over the last few years?

Long story short, the company has been mismanaged, financing stock buybacks with debt in order to make up for the stagnating popularity in their newer content. The company additionally has been hurt due to the prevalence of cord cutting, due to competitors like Netflix. Now here comes the good news: 

New management has been instated as of December 2016, and since then revenue and ratings have taken a turn for the better. Additionally, management is focused on paying down the companies debt in order to remain ""investment grade."" Over the last year, the company has reduced its long term debt by 15%. 

So what's the big idea? VIA owns entertainment giants such as Nickelodeon, MTV, Paramount Pictures and Comedy Central. Thanks to new management, the company has been able to make up for losses in cable customers through online platforms, and expanding into foreign countries. Their biggest asset is the thousands of hours of creative content they have under their name. This could be a huge boon for the likes of Apple who wants to get into the industry. Why pay 100b for Netflix when you could grab VIA for 1/8 of the price?

Just-Touch-It;1515086657;7o4hk8;;4;;0;"Hi and happy new year everyone. I was hoping some of us here would perhaps be interested in discussing the company STORE Capital (STOR). The company is a REIT that is unique in a number of ways. Some of you may have heard of STORE a few months back when Warren Buffet, somewhat unexpectedly, purchased just under 10% of the company’s shares back in July of this past year. If you’re like me, any time Buffet makes a big splash like this, it at the very least grabs your attention. After seeing him invest in this company, I became extremely interested and began to look into it myself. I’m still early in my investing and retirement planning stages and during that time in July I had already maxed out my IRA yearly contributions. Additionally, I unfortunately do not have the option to have a 401k so I had to put it on the back burner at that time. Now with a fresh start in 2018, a goal of mine was to add a REIT into my IRA if a company/fund that I felt deserving was available. So here I am, asking what you guys think?

STORE Capital is somewhat unique as a REIT as it is considered a triple net leasing real estate company that focuses on middle of the market companies. This means it passes on the costs and responsibilities of things like insurance, property taxes, and building maintenance directly onto the company leasing the property from them. Whether or not this is beneficial or a good move in the long run can be debated but it is fairly unique in comparison to most of the real estate companies and funds we often see around here.

One thing I really like the company is that it has less holdings in things like malls, retail stores, and shopping plazas in comparison to most REIT holdings. They’re still there but less so than most. I think online shopping has taken such a toll on these places that I’m often surprised how heavily some of these funds/companies can be on them. STORE instead seems to place more emphasis on things like factories, manufacturing plants, restaurants, and to my surprise daycare/child care centers. Despite many manufacturing jobs going overseas, I still think they’re a safer bet than retail and that we may actually see an increase in them with the increase in automation providing cheaper costs for companies in the long run. I also think the daycare centers is a great pick as many of these places are absolute goldmines and most parents need someone/somewhere to keep their kids while they work. The restaurant part I’m pretty neutral on but one part I somewhat disliked was how roughly 6% of their holdings are in movie theaters which I sadly think are following a similar path as many of the brick and mortar retail stores and shopping malls are.

I admittedly only looked quick at their finances but they seem to offer a solid dividend and their financial numbers/figures look reasonable to my novice eyes. There is some increasing debt but there growth, cash flow, and net income has grown over the years and there is a sense of optimism this will continue for the most part barring any crash or major downturn. They haven’t been public (listed in 2014) on the market very long so it’s tough to imagine exactly how’d they’d perform during down years or in a recession but they seem to at least not any have major red flags to my eyes. Perhaps, someone with more experience or knowledge can chime in here on that end?

So, what do you guys think? Are they a nice addition to the average joe like me looking to add some exposure to REITS into their portfolio, specificity to their IRA? Did Warren Buffet make the right pick once again or is it far too early to tell at this point?";;STORE Capital (STOR);

I've recently invested in TQQQ using a self directed trading platform and understand its a very volatile ETF. I'm 100% okay with dealing with its daily price swings. That being said, I want to set up a stop loss to protect myself in the event of a black swan event (like North Korean detonating a nuke over the pacific etc. etc.). 

My self directed trading platform allows me to set up a trailing stop loss order. This 'trailing order' essentially sets a rule to sell the asset when it drops X%. Now I need to determine what that % is.

Is there a way I can use yahoo finance or some other charting tool to determine what the average +/- percentage is of the asset? I want to set a stop loss BELOW this average so that it only trips in the event of a catastrophe.

So, my understanding is (please correct me if I’m wrong), operating cash flow is the cash flow that a company cannot change easily, and investing (less capital expenditure) and financing cash flows are cash flows (usually outflows) that a company has much more control over than operating cash flows. So, companies have much less ability to control capital expenditure than other investment cash flows (obviously the company can control capital expenditures but what I’m saying is that, unlike other investment cash flows, it seems that the company couldn’t really skimp on this investment without ruining the company). So, is this why FCF is operating cash flow minus capital expenditure? Because, unlike non-capex investment cash flows and financial cash flows, operating cash flow and capital expenditures are vital to the life of the company? Is this somewhat correct or am I totally off base here (this is all basically an educated guess).

I’m confused though as to whether the cash flow of the base year is just pulled directly from the statement of cash flows or if you have to do a little more manual work to calculate your cash flows that will be used in the valuation?

darkmeatchicken;1515131201;7o96up;;4;;1;"When I was a kid, my parents tossed my cash presents (from birthdays, etc) into a vanilla savings account.  Interest rates were much better in the 80's, so that wasn't a terrible play.  These days interest rates on most savings accounts are quite low, so I'm playing around with possibilities and want input.

My kids are 6mo, 3yo and 5 yo. 


Here is what I'm currently doing:  I'm keeping a ledger of the gift amount and date it was received, but simply tossing the money into my own brokerage account.  My plan is to do excel-fu later on and provide them a fair interest rate based on market performance and the date of ""deposit"".  My wife and I are in our mid-thirties, both employed with low six figure jobs with good benefits, are moderately aggressive in our investments and max our tax-advantaged retirement plans.  I'm not worried about us ""not following through"" on paying out.


While I think it is likely this money will go toward college or something else big, I don't want to lock it into a 529.  We are already contributing to those ourselves.


At some point, I do plan on splitting this money out and setting my kids up with their own accounts and that is where I need input.  

**1:** Are there tax liabilities for giving the kids THEIR money, that I kept in my accounts?

**2:** What child savings vehicles are out there that have no minimum or regular deposit requirements that actually give a return worth looking at?  CDs and Bonds seem like chump change.

**3:** At what age should  I make my children more aware of this process?  Right now, the five year old knows his money is going into the bank of mommy and daddy and I've actually set up pivot tables so he can look at his deposit history and current balance.  I give him receipts when he deposits and he saves those receipts - but he still as no concept of the value of money.";;Need input re: savings vehicles for children;

This bill, which President Trump quickly signed, was self-evidently bad for consumers at the time—and if anyone needs further proof of how ridiculous and harmful these clauses are, just look at what Wells Fargo has been up to over the past several months. The mega-bank famously issued at least 3.5 million fake accounts without consumer consent, triggering a $185 million fine to state and federal regulators. The bank aimed to demonstrate sales growth to investors and boost the stock price with bogus numbers, but millions of customers got caught up in the exchange, paying unnecessary fees and taking hits to their credit scores. Scores of defrauded customers sued Wells Fargo in a series of class-action lawsuits.

Wells Fargo then tried to defy metaphysical reality: It moved to block one class-action case in Utah by claiming that the arbitration clause in customer contracts on the real accounts they held at the bank also applied to the fake accounts. By this theory, Wells Fargo customers signed away their legal rights when it came to accounts they didn’t even sign.   https://www.thenation.com/article/the-ceo-of-wells-fargo-might-be-in-big-big-trouble/";;The CEO of Wells Fargo Might Be in Big, Big Trouble;

When a monthly CD has a yield of 1.3%, what's preventing me from investing $5000, getting a return of $65, investing that $5065 next month at a similar rate, and just keep doing that every month?  When you get 1.3% return every month, and keep re-investing it with the interest, $5000 turns into almost $400,000 in 20 years.  I know that's slow going but obviously it snowballs after a length of time.  CD's are also FDIC insured I believe, so it's impossible to lose money.

So...my question:  What am I missing?  Is the 1.3% yield not really a 1.3% return on my investment in 1 month's time?  Should I be dividing it by something?  Why wouldn't this compound interest plan work like I'm thinking?";;This has to be a dumb question about monthly CD's;
