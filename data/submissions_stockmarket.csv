blackdragon1299;1514843843;7nhxjo;;17;;45;"This is a weekly series I like to do, go stir up some discussion for potential plays for the upcoming trading week. If you don't want to read this wall of text, check out the video: https://youtu.be/4habZ6Comg0


The 5 stocks this week that I'm watching are Alphabet (GOOGL), Alibaba (BABA), Visa (V), Paypal (PYPL) and the 5th is actually an index fund this week - the QQQ (Nasdaq ETF). 


* Google, or Alphabet, has had a big selloff the last 2 weeks going into the end of 2017 and into 2018. I believe that this will reverse in the upcoming week as buyers come back in and volume picks up. It may dip slightly below to the uptrend support that I outlined, which is in line with its 50 day MA, so that is another key level to watch.


* Next we have Alibaba, which is a stock I am extremely bullish on and hold in my long term portfolio as well. Alibaba has been consolidating for the last few weeks after a big selloff, but I believe the bulk of the damage is behind us. If we see volume come in this week, we will bounce off the uptrend support, break through the MA, and start a recovery before we hit $200 in a few months.


* Third we have Visa. This stock held up well even though the markets sold off, and we closed off friday about $0.90 off the ATH (all time high). We are still above the uptrend support, and I believe the holiday shopping season will push Visa to new ATH soon.


* Fourth is PayPal. Another company that will benefit from the holiday season and I think will make a recovery after it's recent sell off the last month or so. PayPal is holding it's technicals very well, and is holding the uptrend support as well. Again, if we see volume come back into the market, especially in tech, we will see PayPal make a run for ATH.


* Finally we have the Nasdaq ETF - QQQ - which follows mostly tech stocks. This is a good indicator as to how the market is doing, and the QQQ's are currently at a level that is slightly above some uptrend support. This is a key level to watch this week - if we bounce off this, we will see all of tech start a recovery, if we break through this support, we will start making lower prices on most of tech stocks.

When you use a demo account, you get a feel for the provider you will be using. This is one of the main reasons spread betting firms offer these free simulated trading accounts. These firms get you used to the trading platform. So you are more likely to stick with them when you trade with real money.
With the help of demo accounts, it is easy to try out a few trading systems. Before putting real money in. As you know that various accounts do not allow you to trade in the full range of markets. So it becomes really tougher to actually do.";;Various Uses of Demo Accounts that You Need to Know;

VRgamer84;1514900450;7nmgw3;;8;;0;"So I have dabbled in stock trading off and on but have been out of it for years, anyway, every year for the last several years I kept telling myself that no way the market will keep going higher and a crash will happen, well I've been wrong and the market has just gone up!

So I decided now is the time, especially with tax reform set to boost stocks and I'm finally ready to invest. So here are my questions..

I'm going to invest $5,250.00, BUT I'm thinking about using margin so I can invest $10,500. 

The interest rate on the margin loan is 8.5% which is $446.00 per year, the dividends paid out from the stocks I want are $490.00 per year.

Can I just use dividends to pay the interest on the margin loan?

Also, is margin a good idea? It seems like if investors used margin the last decade they would have made a ton of money!

Also, I'm wanting to invest long term and as long as the dividends keep paying the margin interest, I can use margin to hold stocks long term Right?

Fyi, I'm going to be smart and invest in good, great tech companies. I'm looking to take positions in INTC, AAPL, FB, AMZN and MSFT using margin.

My questions are

* what’s a good starting amount before investment? I currently have $1000 stored away and I work part-time, so I can save more and wait longer if needs be.

* Is it necessary to go to a stoke broker? Or can I do everything myself? (I like being independent)

And finally and perhaps the most stupid question but the one I struggle with the most. 

* Where do I go to invest in these Index funds/stocks? As well as manage/ create a portfolio with everything in it?

I'm 30 y.o., married, 1 child, employed and looking into saving some money to buy a car within next 1 or 2 years (our current old car will have some parts replaced and we hope it will be good for that period of time). Currently we hold most of our cash on a savings account; we also invest long-term in ETF's/funds. 

Since the cash is practically losing value while resting on the savings account, I'm thinking about allocating some of it (3000€) to my investing account and purchase ETF(s) with potential for the next 1-2 years (depending on how long the current car works) and supply it with monthly payments of 200€. I can afford to lose max. 10% and hoping to gain 20%.

Technical analysts combine two indicators together to grab better opportunities in the market. Tushar Chande developed a unique indicator, which brings together the features of candlestick analysis with the relative strength index. The traders use this technical indicator to gauge the right time to buy or sell the stocks. The indicator informs the traders about the relationship between stock open price and the closing price of the stock over a certain period.

In general, the Bollinger bands strategy engages a double bottom set up. The initial bottom of the double bottoms and Bollinger bands combination has a strong volume. Another movement observed in this formation is a sharp price pullback, which gets close outside of the lower Bollinger band. These kinds of moves are called an automatic rally. When the rally starts, the price tries to retest the current lows that are set in order to check the strength of the buying stress. Technical analysts wish to retest bar inside the lower band. This represents the downward pressure in the price of the stocks, which has fallen down. Now there will be more buyers than sellers. Traders need to keep in mind the volume factor also.

These are some of the immense trading techniques. Many traders and technical analysts use a bunch of technical indicators together in a chart due to the messy feeling they get. Traders put on price, volume and Bollinger bands on the charts. The veteran professionals of Money Classic Research offer accurate stock market tips to their clients.

EDIT: According to Apple's balance sheet, Apple has $35.867 billion common stock (and $0 APIC which means that the company just lumps every stock valuation together into one line item?) and $5.252 billion shares outstanding giving each share a value of less that $7 - does anyone know how this number is calculated?";;Question about how a company’s stock is valued on the balance sheet;

blackdragon1299;1515356266;7ot0qk;;10;;14;"Last week was absolutely amazing. I hope everyone here had good gains and took profits as well! My picks from last week did exceptionally well:

* GOOGL - 5.4%

* BABA - 10.6%

* V - 4.24%

* PYPL - 6.9%

* QQQ - 3.95%


Looking into this week, we are due for some consolidation or pullback, but there are a still plays that could work out this week. As always, I have this in video format [which you can watch here](https://youtu.be/PoibBodbkLU) if you don't want to read this block of text.

1. Apple (AAPL) - So although tech had a big week, Apple kind of lagged behind. It's a slow mover, BUT, once it gets moving, it makes big moves. The technicals show it's at a critical point for a breakout, so keep a close eye on this. If we see any news leak about positive iPhone 10 sales over the holiday season, expect this to go to ATH. Also ER is scheduled for Feb 1, so we will most likely see a run up soon enough.


2. Nvidia (NVDA) - Solid company, and it had a rough couple of months after breaking the $200 level. Now we're back, and with CES around the corner, I suspect this will have a good move as well. Earnings again I believe is in Feb. If you look @ the technicals, you can see that it broke a key uptrend resistance level on STRONG volume - this is a very good sign for the stock as buyers have come back in and believe it should move higher. When Nvidia gets moving, we see it move A LOT, so this is a good one to watch this week.


3. Square (SQ) - Recovering from ATH of $50 from couple months ago, Square is starting to make a comeback. We saw it bottom out around $34 or so (I personally wanted it to $30, but that's fine...) and now we see some movement upwards. Once again, we broke resistance on good volume, and now we bounced off support (and the 50 day) with STRONG volume. This is good confirmation that we are ready to start heading back to the ATH of $50 in this stock, but it may take a few weeks to get there. Friday had amazing movement, and overall I think we have a lot more room to move here. I personally picked up some LEAPs (Jan 2019 expiry, 50C) and they were fairly cheap. I don't think we'll have any problems seeing Square back at $50 before Jan 2019...


4. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) - They got a nice rally thanks to the news that came out from EA last week. Typically gaming stocks like to follow each others movement (EA, ATVI, TTWO), but I think technically, TTWO has the best charts and the best potential for a swing trade. If you look @ the charts, you can see that it broke through a key resistance level, on good volume, so we should be watching it closely next week to see if volume continues on with this. The stock has been beaten down since making new ATH a few months ago, although nothing fundamentally changed, so I think we'll see a good move up in the upcoming weeks as long as the market keeps moving up.


5. Walmart (WMT) - This is a new stock I've never covered on my 5 stocks weekly videos, but the consolidation on this caught my attention. I have a position in them, longer dated calls, because I do believe we are just waiting for a Catalyst to gap up and move higher. This is the first time the stock closed above $100, which is typically a big resistance point for a stock to get past. It has consolidated around here since its last ER, and this move up was expected. Now as long as volume comes in, we could see this at $105-$110 before the next ER. If we see news come out that they had a record holiday season or something like this, I expect it to gap up and start a good rally. Walmart is a slow mover though, so it may take a few weeks to see movement here, but keep an eye on it!


So that covers the 5 stocks for this week. As always, please comment below to share what stocks you're watching this week, what you think about these 5 stocks that I covered, and how you did with your picks from the previous week.

blackdragon1299;1515547814;7pc302;;42;;96;"Now these are just 10 that I think will be pretty big. There are going to be others that will go public in 2018 (I saw that Aston Martin is planning to go public soon at a similar valuation to Ferrari - Ticket $RACE) and some may not go public this year, but may get delayed to 2019, or 2020... or may never go public. Please add any companies you are watching to go public in 2018 in the comments so we can look into them as well. If you want to watch the video where I go more in depth on each pick, here it is: https://youtu.be/zJQagRBjDCk


* 1: Spotify - Spotify is a company that has a dominance in the music streaming space, and competes with companies like Pandora, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Google Music, but has still managed to be the #1 choice for consumers. in 2018, we will most likely see this company go public. I can see them being the Netflix of music - and eventually become their own label (like original content)


* 2: Uber - Popular ride sharing app that is used around the world and most people know about the company and use it regularly as well. Strong rumours that this will indeed go public in 2018, but this was also rumoured in 2017. They are valued at somewhere between 60-70B.


* 3: Lyft - Competitor to Uber and also a ridesharing app. Not as big as uber around the world however the most enticing part of this company is that they have Alphabet is an investor (I believe a 1B investment from Alphabet). They are valued at somewhere between 10-15B.


* 4: Avaya - Hardware company, transforming to a software and services company. They are big in the UC space, and Contact Center space as well. Main competitors are Cisco and Mitel in the same space. Recently came out of Chapter 11, and not quite sure on their valuation when they will go public.


* 5: Xiaomi - This is a chinese company who primarily makes smartphones and related electronics (power banks, accessories, etc.). They are making waves in China and is a good competitor to Huawei in China. If they go public in 2018, they will come in at around a 50B valuation.


* 6: Airbnb - This is a popular app for travelers. It allows you to rent out your house or room to earn a bit more income whenever you are on vacation, or if you have extra space in your house being unused. The prices are typically cheaper than hotels and I personally used it, for example for cottage rentals with friends, or when we traveled to Japan. Airbnb is great when you can't find a Hotel in a rural area, or if you want to stay in the heart of the city for cheaper than a hotel (typically). They are currently valued at 30-40B.


* 7: Dropbox - They allow you to upload and share files with others online. They are essentially cloud storage, and was one of the first ones to do this before others got in the game (Apple, Google, etc.). Think of it as a hard drive that is hosted by Dropbox, and you can upload and download files from there at any time, share the files with friends, etc. Dropbox is currently valued at 10B in 2014, not sure where it's at now, but if I had to guess, I'd say 15-20B.


* 8: Ancestry.com - Allows you to see your family tree. I've never used it personally, but they claim to have over 7B records from US, Canada, Europe. They offer a free trial if you're curious about family roots, so could check it out and see if you want to subscribe to their service (I personally would never...). Currently valued at around 3B.


* 9: Zscaler - Cloud and security company that provides firewalls, antivirus, SSL, and anything required in keeping a secure connection. They are big in the enterprise space and have a good presence in the industry for security. Currently only valued at 1B which may be a pretty good deal for a company that provides good value.


* 10: Pinterest - They are essentially a Social network. It's idea is for images and to save images to view later. For example, my wife used it before the wedding and would add different hairstyle ideas in there. She could go on google images and when she sees one she likes, there's a button to add to Pinterest. Then you have all of these pictures in 1 spot later to compare and view. The company is currently valued at around 12-13B.

TommyShinebox;1515702495;7pr0vi;;4;;6;"I've been looking at stock data for a work project and I'm having no luck finding a comprehensive breakdown of the 52-wk measurements (shockingly so). I've got a mountain of statistics and data frames and other formulas to throw at the data, but this simple data point is confounding me.

For example...

When considering a 520wk high, am I looking at the intraday high or the highest close? And most importantly, wtf constitutes 52 weeks ago today anyway? The highest price (intraday or close) in the last 52 calendar weeks counting the current week? Even if a mid-week measurement makes it less than a full 52 weeks (for example, if I measured today instead of EOD Friday? Are weeks with holiday blackouts or other reasons for suspended trade still counted as full weeks?

I am using RBC Brokerage, I will incur a $9.95 charge. I would like to make over 100% return in 6 months.
I have very little idea if that's possible and of what I'm doing but I just want to jump in and try rather than use stock market simulators.

I'm not interested in penny stocks and im not interested in selling and buying within the 6 months, (unless I get 100% ROI) I think my profit would get eaten up by the 9.95 transaction fee.

I'd love to have a diverse portfolio because I think it would be more interesting to watch a few different ones. 

------
Also to calculate my ROI do I include my transaction fee of 9.95 in the cost of my investment? Since the transaction fee is 10% of my total expenditure.
ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) x 100
ROI = ((220-110)/110)X100 =100%

And am I mistaken, can I purchase a bunch of different stocks and pay the transaction fee once, or does the charge happen for each different company I purchase stocks from?

I don’t see any way their shares aren’t going down in the coming days; even the “positive” articles I’ve read about them recently concede that their share price will likely drop a few more dollars before it could possible rebound. Based on what management has hid from the public in the past months, I strongly believe that this earnings report won’t meet expectations and could possibly reveal even more skeletons in the closet.

Lately, I have been worried about our investments.  All I know is he has short positions on tesla and netflix, and that isn't doing so well right now.  When it has come up with his friend who does this for a living, he jokes about how sketchy and risky my husband is with his positions.  
He will not talk to me in detail about it, and I have no idea how much money we have lost, or potentially could lose.  A couple of months ago, he said we lost about 100k, but we made some or most of that back.
I just feel lost since I am not knowledgeable in this subject. He also covers most of our expenses, so I don't know if it's justified for me to stay out of it. We do well with our salary income, but I still feel like I should know what's going on with our money.
Anyway, I am asking you all how can I get him to talk to me about our investments, or what kind of questions I can ask to have a more clear gauge on where we are financially. Any tips on how to approach this subject with him, or what works with your marriage of this topic, would be greatly appreciated. ";;Do you discuss investments with your SO?;

I know this is a bit of a redundant question in many ways, as there are so many elements involved and also no one knows the answer. However, I would like to get a view of all your individual opinions.

I've always wanted AMZN and GOOG stocks while in University (2-3 years ago) but couldn't afford them. I made my first entry into the stock market this December with BAC, JP Morgan &amp; Citi Group shares. They're all doing pretty well. BAC is on 7-8% growth at the moment.

I also want Amazon shares, but I feel like I may be purchasing at a weak time because I'm not buying at a dip (albeit a minor/temporary one). I should have bit the bullet in December but made a mistake. I wonder if there will be some sort of price correction in the near future or dip that I can capitalise on. I'm struggling to make the necessary logical deductions on this particular piece.

Would be helpful to know your thoughts/opinions on this so I can flesh out my perspective on this particular question.

Thanks,

&gt;SAN DIEGO, Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholder rights law firm Johnson Fistel, LLP has launched an investigation into whether the board members of U.S. Geothermal Inc. (NYSE: HTM) (""U.S. Geothermal"") breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed sale of the Company to Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ORA) (""Ormat"").

On January 24, 2018, U.S. Geothermal announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement with Ormat. Under the terms of the agreement, U.S. Geothermal shareholders will receive $5.45 per share in cash.

&gt;The investigation concerns whether the U.S. Geothermal board failed to satisfy its duties to the Company shareholders, including whether the board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the board obtained the best price possible for U.S. Geothermal shares of common stock. Nationally recognized Johnson Fistel is investigating whether the proposed deal represents adequate consideration, especially given the Company's projected revenue and earnings growth and one Wall Street analyst has a $6.00 price target on the stock.

&gt;If you are a shareholder of U.S. Geothermal and believe the proposed buyout price is too low or you're interested in learning more about the investigation or your legal rights and remedies, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker (jimb@johnsonfistel.com) at 619-814-4471.

I've gone into the VB code and reduced the throttle interval so that the RTD function will report data in realtime to excel and I've written the code necessary to record such updates. The problem I'm having is that the change in overall volume at times does not match the trade that occurred. For example Volume might be at 100,000 and a trade for 500 shares goes through and volume changed to 100,750. Many of the trades recorded are accurately reflected however not all.

FEATURECREDIT: CHARLES WILLIAMS FOR VARIETY
With 70 Million Subscribers and a Risky IPO Strategy, Is Spotify Too Big to Fail?
By Jem Aswad and Janko Roettgers
Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood has served as the home of Spotify’s U.S. headquarters since 2010, but not for much longer.

Later this year, the streaming music company plans to move most of its 1,200 New York-based employees into 14 floors at 4 World Trade Center in the rejuvenated Financial District. As part of the deal for the 15-year lease, New York is granting an $11 million rent reduction in exchange for keeping more than 800 jobs in the state and adding 1,000 more employees.

But Spotify will make its presence felt in Lower Manhattan in 2018 in more ways than one. Sometime in the coming months at the New York Stock Exchange, just blocks away from its new home, the company will embark on what’s known as a direct listing, an unconventional initial public offering method that has never before been attempted on such a large scale.

Spotify and Wall Street aren’t the only ones that will be anxiously watching; count the music industry in as well. Its fortunes are largely bound with Spotify, which is becoming the industry’s top music distributor. Should the Sweden-based firm’s bold move backfire, its partners at the major record labels will feel the pain too.

“Just think about their depth of influence in the world,” says Capitol Music Group chairman-CEO Steve Barnett of Spotify. “[A recent Nielsen] report noted that Americans are spending more than 32 hours a week listening to music — up from [23.5] hours in two years. That tells you, for all the mistakes the industry made over a long period of time, things have been corrected.”

But as Spotify increases its lead over even bigger rivals like Apple and Amazon, the direct listing is raising concerns that the company could experience the kind of turbulence currently rocking another digital-media darling, Snap.

“That’s a pretty bad scenario,” says a major-label executive who has worked with Spotify for many years. “The music industry is back to growth, and you can feel investors saying, ‘Let’s take another shot at music.’ If it crashes and burns, Wall Street and the investment community might say, ‘Even this second chance didn’t work’ and become paranoid.”

A Spotify rep said its executives are prohibited by SEC regulations from discussing the direct listing or the company’s business plans.

Spotify’s recent growth has been nothing short of explosive. Founded in Sweden in 2006, launched in Europe in 2008 and in the U.S. in 2011, it announced in January that it had passed 70 million paying subscribers and 140 million active users (the latter category defined as free or paying users within the previous 30 days). The service is available in 61 countries.

The company has managed to avoid the kryptonite that felled or foiled many of its predecessors — opposition from Universal, Sony and Warner, the three major music groups and the world’s primary music-rights holders — by making them partners on multiple levels, including giving them a piece of the action in the form of a combined interest in Spotify that has been reported to be as high as 18%, although knowledgeable sources tell Variety it is actually “much lower.”

In recent years, the economic catchphrase has held true: As Spotify goes, so goes the music industry. With streaming leading the way, the music business is projected to post its third consecutive year of growth. This success follows 15-odd years of a brutally demoralizing, illegal-downloading-induced downturn that saw global recorded-music revenues plunge from $23.8 billion in 1999 to $14.3 billion in 2014, according to the Intl. Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Today, estimates of Spotify’s market valuation are $19 billion, up from $16 billion in September. “It’s the golden boy, the ‘Star Wars’ of the music industry,” says Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, who has been covering Spotify for several years.

If there’s one golden boy in the picture, it’s Spotify co-founder/CEO Daniel Ek, whose business credentials have drawn enthusiasts and investors like Sean Parker and Scooter Braun (manager of Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande, among others) into his orbit. Ek’s low-key demeanor belies his swagger: His 2016 wedding was held on the shores of Italy’s glamorous Lake Como; Chris Rock officiated, Mark Zuckerberg attended and Bruno Mars performed at the reception.

But Spotify’s expansion strategy has come at a cost. The streaming giant is losing hundreds of millions of dollars every year. For 2016, its net loss was $601 million; $206 million the year before. Its 2016 gross profit was just $502 million. Its headlong rush to market dominance has been fueled by liberal spending on staffing, marketing and product development — not to mention those new offices. Artists and songwriters complain loudly about what they consider Spotify’s low royalty rates. The company has been dogged by lawsuits from music publishers and songwriters — including a $1.6 billion suit earlier this month from Wixen Music Publishing — which get a much smaller slice of the royalty pie than labels. And five days into 2018, its chief content officer of three years, Stefan Blom, who negotiated many of those deal renewals with the majors and led the move into video, surprisingly announced he was stepping down.

Rather than filing for a traditional IPO, the company in December secretly filed for a direct listing of its shares, a process in which no new stock is issued — and no money is raised — but existing investors and insiders can trade their shares on the open market. The rarely used process allows Spotify to skip the multi-week “road show” of sweet-talking key institutional investors. It also won’t need to enlist and pay investment banks to underwrite the offering, and longtime employees and other shareholders won’t be under a lock-up period; they’ll be able to trade their shares on day one.

The flip side is that forgoing a conventional IPO initially won’t allow Spotify to raise new capital. And without underwriters to calm the waters, the stock could turn out to be a lot more volatile from the start, which is why Revolution Ventures managing partner David Golden is skeptical of the approach. “This is really a solution looking for a problem,” he says. An IPO would offer a lot more security for not that much more money, he argues. Golden believes that Spotify is out to “poke their finger in the eye of traditional Wall Street.”

Not everyone agrees. “If there is any private company to pull this off, it is Spotify,” argues Rohit Kulkarni, who has been following the service closely as managing partner of SharesPost, a marketplace for pre-IPO shares. Spotify has for years been operating much like a public company, he says. Incorporated in Luxembourg, the company has been filing detailed financial disclosure reports every year with local regulators.

“They’ve been very shrewd,” says a second major-label executive, who has worked closely with Spotify for many years. “The public listing is unusual, but from everything we’ve observed, people have a good understanding of the business, and they have a high degree of visibility and interest in the investment community.”

Spotify may draw some inspiration from Amazon, which lost hundreds of millions of dollars in its first few years as a public company, but investors stuck with the stock because the e-tailer reliably grew its business every quarter. On the other hand, Twitter and Snapchat stumbled not because of their monetary losses but primarily because of stalling user growth.

“Trying to conquer a market, gain share and bet on the future seems to be the playbook of the 21st century,” says the second major-label exec. “There’s always the conventional investor skepticism about ‘Show me the bottom line,’ but that doesn’t necessarily seem to be the binding rule of law with successful enterprises these days.”

Investors may not insist on Spotify turning profitable for a few more years, but they do want to be assured it has a path to profitability. One way to get there would be more favorable deals with labels. Its business model calls for paying out around 70% of its annual revenue in royalties.

Sources tell Variety that when the company hits certain subscriber and revenue targets, its royalty rates will ease, and that its 2017 agreements with the big three music groups also came with lower rates in exchange for some concessions on “windowing” new releases from its freemium service (which rights holders loathe but many insiders say has helped persuade millions of people to become paying subscribers). The new rates have helped to improve Spotify’s gross margins from 15% in 2016 to 22% in the first half of 2017, according to SharesPost estimates.

But many rights holders who aren’t major record labels say Spotify’s rates remain unfairly low — while there is no clear-cut number, the company reports that it pays out between $0.006 and $0.0084 per stream, which works out far better for a superstar artist than a smaller act.

“I’m looking at what we pay out every single day, and it’s a lot,” maintains Spotify global head of creator services Troy Carter, former manager of Lady Gaga and Meghan Trainor. “I think there’s a level of complexity to payments: Either an artist doesn’t have the audience at scale on the platform, or the way their deal is set up with their distributor or label means the money isn’t trickling down to them. I’m seeing artists who are generating gross revenues in eight figures, so the payments are being made — it’s just a matter of who’s receiving them.”

And while Spotify and the majors often spar over rates and terms and percentages, last year the company struck new licensing deals with all three, as well as with the independent-label collective Merlin. Spotify secured a $1 billion loan in 2016, and in December, it announced a stock swap with Chinese internet goliath Tencent’s music division. Not only does that give Spotify an additional financial cushion, but the two companies complement each other geographically: Spotify is strong in Europe and the Americas; Tencent dominates in Asia.

But Spotify has to look for other ways to improve its margins. One obvious area is its ad business, which hasn’t been profitable either. Another is infrastructure. Spotify struck a big multiyear deal with Google for the use of the search engine’s cloud services in early 2016, and may be able to marginally improve its cost structure when it renegotiates that agreement down the line. Sources also tell Variety that Spotify is aggressively exploring ways to monetize its data.

Finally, Spotify could be looking to grow other sources of revenue that aren’t dependent on music royalties. This was one of the reasons the company ventured into original video in 2016. However, it quickly realized it had bitten off more than it could chew and scaled back its video efforts a year later. In September, Disney exec Courtney Holt was brought in to restart efforts on that front (see sidebar).

Spotify is still experimenting with some video formats and has been doubling down on audio podcasts. Kulkarni says he wouldn’t be surprised if the company eventually adds other forms of non-music audio, but he also cautions to not expect too much from these side projects: “It is still an experimental revenue stream for Spotify.”

Investors may not necessarily be spooked by Spotify’s losses as long as the company’s user base continues to grow at a strong pace. Of streamers who subscribe, which make up 80% of all on-demand audio streaming in the U.S., according to BuzzAngle, Spotify leads its nearest competitor by 40 million paying users (Apple Music has 30 million).

The music business seems to be riding Spotify’s coattails; U.S. spending on music surged 17% to almost $4 billion in the first half of 2017, and streaming grew 48%. Streaming now generates more than half the entire U.S. music industry’s revenue.

All sources generally agree that “it would be a massive speed bump if Spotify did a faceplant,” as the second exec puts it. “But does that ultimately mean it derails the music business? No. In terms of the ‘too big to fail’ question, at the end of the day Spotify’s sails are full of the wind of the mega-trend that is the mass migration of consumers to the cloud. It’s the same thing that’s fueling Netflix’s growth and causing disruption across the media landscape.”

Less convinced is music industry attorney Chris Castle. “There are some companies that just aren’t supposed to be public, and I think [Spotify is] one,” he says. “They’ve grown by seeding their business with venture money and their topline is considerable, and there’s nothing to suggest they have any intention of getting their costs under control. If they’re trying to say that they can’t run their money-losing business without having those expensive offices in the World Trade Center, OK, but don’t come crying to me about royalty rates.”

Over the past few weeks, there have been tremendous increases in the prices of stocks of companies such as Tesla, Alibaba, Goldman Sachs, etc. The market momentum has remained strong over the course of the past few decades. There has not been a stock market correction for close to eight years, and supposedly, we are already overdue for a correction. For those who don't know what a correction is: it is when stocks and bonds decrease in value more than 10 percent its value. I believe that the market will still be bullish for the next few months, but in the near future, there will be something in proximity of a correction. I hate to be pessimistic, but financial records and reports show a strong percentage of an occurrence like this happening. I'd begin to start taking it slow on long term investments for now. Personally, I began to invest short term for the past few weeks, and so far, I've made 500 dollars.

Although this did happen over a year ago, do you Redditors think that this will impact the stock prices for Tesla? Personally, I don't think so. This is because of the fact that Tesla has such a large population of engineers designing and creating every aspect of a car, so one person, even one that USED to have an impact, will not have that much of an effect on the company.

 Viacom CBS Merger Shotgun Wedding
CREDIT: ILLUSTRATION: VARIETY; PHOTOS: SHUTTESTOCK
America’s favorite on-again, off-again relationship might be back on.

No, not Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez; CBS Corp. and Viacom. The companies’s CEOs held an informal talk last week about a potential merger with the expectation that their respective boards will tackle it in greater depth soon enough.

We’ve watched these two companies play footsy with each other for so long that their dynamic has taken on that classic will-they-or-won’t-they? formula from your favorite romantic comedy.

But there’s a plot twist this time around. Tired of flirtations that went nowhere in late 2016, National Amusements president Shari Redstone seems ready to officiate a shotgun wedding. With controlling stakes in both companies, she’s nudging CBS CEO Leslie Moonves and Viacom CEO Bob Bakish to the altar whether they like it or not.

It’s not difficult to see why Redstone has changed her tune from letting these lovebirds go their separate ways to a forced reunion. Look at pending mergers between AT&amp;T and Time Warner, Disney and Fox, and Discovery and Scripps. Everyone in the sector is mating like rabbits to achieve the kind of scale that gives them a fighting chance against the tech world’s colossi.

But while the peer pressure to couple up is enormous, does that mean CBS and Viacom would be getting together for the right reasons? Maybe not.

Who could blame Moonves for having cold feet considering the distressed state of Viacom. While Bakish deserves credit for wiping away plenty of the dust and rust that have collected on the once-great brands in his portfolio like MTV and Nickelodeon, the sad fact is that the neglect they suffered under for too long during the Philippe Dauman era will take many more years to reverse. Had one true hit emerged from his networks or movie studio this past year, he might have bought himself more time to go it alone, but Bakish didn’t end up that lucky.

And even had he miraculously managed to pull off a quicker turnaround, that would really be besides the point. The linear-network business model that made Viacom so successful for so long seems headed for extinction. Taking on Bakish’s portfolio would dilute the double-digit growth of his beloved retransmission fees.

If Moonves is having problems with commitment, that may have something to do with the fact he’s still playing the field: Verizon, Lionsgate and Sony are just a few of the names CBS is rumored to have talked with about M&amp;A possibilities. But Redstone is highly unlikely to OK a deal that doesn’t have Viacom attached.

But given the shortage of logic dictating a CBS-Viacom deal, it’s tempting to wonder whether such a merger shouldn’t be looked at in a vacuum but as the prelude to yet another deal that combined with another property like a Verizon doesn’t seem so ill-conceived anymore. In this consolidation-crazy era, some Voltron-esque combination of multiple conglomerates doesn’t sound as far-fetched as it once might have.

A good merger should make 1+1=3. CBS and Viacom alone feels more like 1.3.

In the direct-to-consumer world Big Media is headed, CBS has moved shrewdly and aggressively with a multi-pronged brand strategy led by CBS All Access. But what would Moonves do to energize Viacom for that same world given its heavy unscripted library isn’t built for SVOD licensing, where scripted rules, or skinny bundles, where the absence of news and sports is a huge disadvantage.

Moonves would have to reinvent how Viacom’s brands make money to truly rejuvenate them, and that’s one tough pivot to pull off.

Of course, Moonves may be willing to take on that challenge if he’s handed the reins of the combined company under deal terms that won’t make his shareholders revolt. Moonves has a ton of leverage here. He has enough credibility with Wall Street that his departure from the company could punish these stocks at a time when their combination is intended to lift them. But that doesn’t mean Redstone isn’t willing to risk going on without him, perhaps calculating that Bakish has done well enough over the past year to keep investors from freaking out if Moonves leaves.

The power struggle between him and Redstone is a delicate dance, as evidenced by last month’s Wall Street Journal report suggesting she was ready to restock CBS’s board of directors.

Playing hardball in the press may come with the M&amp;A territory but it sends exactly the wrong message to the market considering the tortured history of boardroom shenanigans these companies share. Just when Bakish has done so much good work to stabilize Viacom, the proceedings are threatening to devolve into the kind of dysfunctional mess that marked the Dauman era.

If all parties aren’t careful, the circus atmosphere that overtook Viacom for too long will return in force and destabilize a deal they may have no choice to make despite the inherent difficulties. But this can’t be rushed because there’s a lot at risk.

After all, you can’t hurry love.

The e-commerce giant’s rapid climb in recent years has only accelerated in 2018, pushing the company’s market cap above $700 billion for the first time on Wednesday. That puts it in rarefied territory alongside Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Microsoft Corp.

Assuming the company finishes the session with a market cap above that milestone, it will have made the move in record time by multiple measures. The stock’s 25% surge this month pushed the market value from $600 billion to $700 billion in just 16 trading sessions.

The next fastest hops between $100 billion milestones for Amazon were the 135 sessions that it took to clear two separate hurdles: $300 billion in 2015 and $600 billion earlier this month, according to The Wall Street Journal’s Market Data Group. And it’s made the jump from $600 billion to $700 billion faster than any other company: Apple took 119 days, Alphabet took 372, and Microsoft took 4,548.

The milestone is the latest sign of just how much weight Amazon has to throw around in the stock market. And recently it’s been doing just that. On Tuesday, it sent health-care stocks tumbling after the firm, along with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, said it is creating a company to figure out how to reduce health-care costs.

The news was far from the only thing that pushed stocks down for their second consecutive session on Tuesday, but that certainly played a key role. The S&amp;P 500 health-care sector fell 2.1% on the day, under-performing the broader index’s 1.1% drop and making it the worst-performing sector.

Shareholders of the healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group Inc, for example, took the news particularly hard, as the Journal’s Morning MoneyBeat newsletter noted on Wednesday. The stock fell 4.4% on Tuesday, subtracting 74 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or more than a fifth of the index’s total decline.

Amazon’s foray into new industries has been known to derail entire stock market sectors from grocery stores to apparel makers. The market cap rise shows that Amazon and its technology-focused peers have ever-more influence in the broader stock market.

And it’s made the jump from $600 billion to $700 billion faster than any other company: Apple took 119 days, Alphabet took 372, and Microsoft took 4,548.

The milestone is the latest sign of just how much weight Amazon has to throw around in the stock market. And recently it’s been doing just that. On Tuesday, it sent health-care stocks tumbling after the firm, along with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, said it is creating a company to figure out how to reduce health-care costs.

The news was far from the only thing that pushed stocks down for their second consecutive session on Tuesday, but that certainly played a key role. The S&amp;P 500 health-care sector fell 2.1% on the day, under-performing the broader index’s 1.1% drop and making it the worst-performing sector.


Shareholders of the healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group Inc, for example, took the news particularly hard, as the Journal’s Morning MoneyBeat newsletter noted on Wednesday. The stock fell 4.4% on Tuesday, subtracting 74 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or more than a fifth of the index’s total decline.

Amazon’s foray into new industries has been known to derail entire stock market sectors from grocery stores to apparel makers. The market cap rise shows that Amazon and its technology-focused peers have ever-more influence in the broader stock market.

These days, Amazon makes up 2.9% of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500, according to FactSet. That’s up from 1.7% at the end of January last year, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

Amazon’s massive market value and its ability to impact other companies’ results expose investors to the risk that any news from the tech giant has the ability to single-handedly determine the direction of large swaths of market, investors say. It comes at a time when stocks are already trading at a high level relative to earnings, and some investors are growing nervous about complacency in the market.

Of course, shares of Amazon itself haven’t been falling. Even as the broader stock market was reeling on Tuesday, Amazon shares rose 1.4% to a fresh record. On Wednesday, the shares were up another 1.5%, poised to set yet another new high.

Instead of worrying about the financial crisis, why not embrace the market and prepare for it.  Many people make big bucks in the market by shorting the stocks.   Let’s start a discussion on the stock/ etf you would buy to Make money!

Let me start:

1) SKF - Ultrashort Financials, if you think the US will have another financial crisis that would be worst than 2008. To give your some idea of the potential, back in 2008 when people panicked, this stock surged as high as $1200 per share, and right now it is only $19??

 2) TMV - Another bear ETF, TMV works through short selling the 20 years+ treasury.

snack-fu-bling;1517516455;7ulogf;;9;;10;"Facebook admitted in its fourth quarter earnings report Jan. 31 that users spent tens of millions of hours less with the social network each day. But that didn’t stop the social media giant from posting yet another record-breaking quarter.

The company reported 48% growth in revenue over the previous year’s fourth quarter, generating $12.9 billion. Profit rose 20% to $4.27 billion from $3.57 billion. Facebook may have significantly beat analysts’ revenue estimates, but the company’s user growth slowed more than expected. Facebook signaled that the steps it’s taking to revamp the News Feed are reducing the time people spend on the platform.


While the results suggest that Facebook’s business is as robust as ever, its stock price initially plummeted after the report. Facebook’s daily user count, which analysts consider a crucial metric for the company’s long-term health, fell short of expectations, totaling 1.4 billion, compared to estimates of 1.41 billion. But when Facebook began discussing its plan for the future of content on its site, Wall Street’s view began to change.


“2017 was a strong year for Facebook, but it was also a hard one,” founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a release, glossing over myriad controversies the company has dealt with around fake news, metrics mistakes, and foreign entities meddling in elections during the year. “In 2018, we’re focused on making sure Facebook isn’t just fun to use, but also good for people’s well-being and for society.”

Earlier this month, Facebook announced that it would be prioritizing posts from friends and family over content from brands and publishers, and that it expected user engagement to fall. Analysts tend to agree that while the move might cost the company in the short term, it’s a good move looking forward.


Zuckerberg said that, in the last quarter, the company’s changes reduced time spent on Facebook by a whopping 50 million hours each day, in part by showing people fewer viral videos. “Helping people connect is more important than maximizing the time people spend on Facebook,” he said on the earnings call.

Facebook also added that the price of its ads has been increasing recently, meaning any loss in revenue from users spending less time on the site and seeing fewer ads should be offset by the more expensive ads.


After initially dropping as much as 4.5% in after-hours trading, Facebook’s stock price jolted back up when executives explained that the changes to the News Feed will likely not have any long-term effects on the company’s guidance for 2018. Its stock was trading up 2.5% from its close at the time of publication.

“News and video will always be an important part of Facebook,” Zuckerberg added on the call.


But there are still rocky roads ahead: Facebook is struggling to find new users as easily as it used to. The social network’s monthly active users rose from 2.07 billion to 2.13 billion quarter-over-quarter—well over half the population of the world’s internet users—but its user growth has slowed on an annual basis. Facebook’s growth on its main site was 14.5% from a year earlier, compared with 16.9% in the same period last year.


The US continues to be Facebook’s main source of revenue, with the gap between Facebook’s home market and others growing. However, daily active users fell in this money-making market.

Apple Inc. left things vague last month when it announced a plan to invest money from its sizable cash balance into the U.S. economy, but the company was more direct about its plans Thursday — it’s going to spend more than $160 billion of its own money.

“Our current net cash position is $163 billion, and given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net-cash neutral over time,” Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on the company’s earnings call.

Translated from corporate speak, that means Apple AAPL, +0.70%  plans to spend that $163 billion and eventually stop collecting huge stores of cash as it has over the past decade, when the company built up about $284 billion in cash reserves while using more than $100 billion in debt to fund shareholder returns and other activities. Pressed to elaborate on what “over time” actually meant, Maestri said Apple would say more in its next quarterly report, when the company typically updates its shareholder-return plans.

The bulk of that money will likely head right back to investors. The company added $50 billion to its shareholder-return plan last year for buybacks and dividends, increasing its program to about $300 billion, and announced a $50 billion increase the year before, as well. Maestri said the company typically returns approximately 100% of its free cash flow to investors, “so that is the approach that we’re going to be taking.”

If Apple decided to double its typical annual increase this spring, however, the company would still have $63 billion in net cash left to spend. There are a number of different ways that the company could use this money. Apple said in its January announcement that it would invest “over $10 billion” in data-center expansions. The company also set out to build a new campus and “create” 20,000 jobs — though it didn’t actually say whether it would hire 20,000 full-time Apple employees.

Apple could also spend some of its net-cash balance to scoop up other companies. Speaking to this point on Apple’s earnings call, Maestri implied that Apple wasn’t looking to change its strategy around acquisitions.

“The thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product road maps, filling a gap in our portfolio, [or] providing a new experience to customers,” he said, adding that Apple looks “at all sizes and we will continue to do so.”

Apple made 19 acquisitions in 2017, Maestri noted, but all are thought to be smaller purchases, which has been Apple’s typical approach. The company’s largest acquisition to date has been Beats, which it purchased for $3 billion back in 2014. Some have speculated that Apple might make a splashy move, buying Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.04%  or Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.67%  .

Those are well out of the company’s price range even if it only increases shareholder return by $50 billion, though, with market values of $115 billion and $167 billion, respectively, and that’s before factoring in the likely hefty premium one would have to pay to buy one of these giants. Apple will probably think smaller with its cash, looking for tuck-in acquisitions that add talent and give the company a base on which to build future product enhancements.

Investors hungry for a piece of that cash sent shares up more than 3% in late trading Thursday. The stock was already up 30.3% over the past 12 months, compared with a 31.6% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% , of which Apple is a component.

snack-fu-bling;1517588612;7usezf;;3;;0;"The first trillion-dollar company? There's sound business sense behind the tech giant swinging for the fences and buying the streaming platform, writes an analyst and shareholder.


Apple is the most dynamic and profitable consumer products company in the world, and Netflix is the most innovative entertainment company. If they got together, the combined entity would be an even bigger juggernaut.

The idea of Apple acquiring Netflix has taken on new heat as the former prepares to repatriate up to roughly $245 billion in overseas cash thanks to the new U.S. tax policy. Wall Street has made good arguments for Apple's rationale for the deal: Apple could get immediate scale in premium video, increase its high-multiple services revenue, become less dependent on the iPhone, reduce its exposure to the mercurial Chinese market and guarantee that Netflix does not fall into the hands of archrivals Google or Amazon. All of these arguments are persuasive.

Allow me to offer two more reasons that are rarely discussed:

First, by acquiring Netflix, Apple would hand consumers around the world a giant win. As the linear television model breaks down, people are increasingly forced to pay for and navigate a hodgepodge of different digital content services. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, HBO Now, CBS All Access — these create complexity and aggravation. People want their entertainment experiences to be simple and fun, not time-consuming and frustrating.

Apple has the resources to dramatically expand the variety of Netflix's content offering, thereby allowing Netflix to meet the entertainment needs of more consumers. More people could find more of what they want to watch on Netflix without having to search through a litany of other apps.

With Apple's $268.7 billion in cash on hand, Netflix could com­pete for sports rights, nonscripted event programming and a wider variety of films and TV shows. Not only would Apple turbocharge the worldwide penetration of Netflix's global subscriber base and build a library of long-tail intellectual property assets, it would become beloved by consumers for delivering an elegant, easy and comprehensive entertainment solution.

The second reason for Apple to acquire Netflix can be distilled into two words: Reed Hastings. In 1997, a $40 late fee from Blockbuster for Apollo 13 set Hastings' dexterous, brilliant mind spinning: There had to be a better way. Twenty years later, against great odds, he has transformed the global entertainment industry and built one of the most valuable companies on Earth. Executive talent of his caliber comes along once in a generation.

By acquiring Netflix, Apple would get Hastings, the equivalent of signing Muhammad Ali to fight for your team. Turning Hastings loose inside Apple, potentially as the next CEO, would be a lollapalooza for consumers and shareholders alike. Apple already is seeking to create shows for its own service, entering the scripted genre with plans to spend $1 billion in its first year. Hastings and his team could help provide the guidance Apple needs.

An Apple-Netflix marriage may be a fantasy dreamed up by the media, hyped by bankers and indulged by doe-eyed shareholders like myself. But great stories never die; maybe the end of this one has yet to be written.

snack-fu-bling;1517600636;7utxg9;;1;;1;"Less than a month ago, Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai said he wanted to ensure his company was “in the driver’s seat,” one of the entertainment players able to buy, not be bought. He had once famously declared that there was no “For Sale” sign hanging on the water tower at the Sony Pictures Entertainment lot.

On Friday, Hirai caught markets and Sony watchers by surprise with his decision to step down as CEO and into an advisory role as chairman beginning April 1. He will be replaced by Kenichiro Yoshida, currently Sony’s CFO and internal head of strategy.

Hirai’s resignation means that Sony’s entertainment assets are losing possibly their loudest and most powerful advocate within the company, and raises questions about their future in an era where consolidation, often on a colossal scale, is the trend of the day. Under Hirai, Sony had made an overture for some of Fox’s assets before Disney produced a bigger bid; without him at the helm, the fate of Sony’s own content businesses is uncertain.

Yoshida, whom Hirai said he had personally recommended to succeed him, said his strategy as CEO would be broadly in line with that of his predecessor. The “vector of my approach” will be the same, but the expression of it will be different, Yoshida said Friday after Sony published its robust third-quarter earnings.

But he offered no specifics. Tellingly, perhaps, he also made almost no reference to Sony’s entertainment businesses, including its Picture Division, which groups together film, TV, music and games, and which recorded an operating profit last quarter after a period of heavy losses. His only nod to entertainment was to tout the creation of a new music label focusing on local talent, a deal signed earlier this week with China’s Tencent.

Instead, Yoshida emphasized the importance of the technology sector. “Market cap is not everything, but the top global companies now are all technology companies….Since Sony is a technology company, we feel a sense of crisis about that situation,” he said, adding that he intends to manage the company “with the market cap in mind.”

Hirai has himself directed much of his attention to Sony’s tech side, and leaves a legacy of tidying up its electronics business, exiting computers, and beefing up its semi-conductor business. With reinvested dividends and share price gains, investors have enjoyed a 226% return during Hirai’s six-year tenure.

But he was also a champion of Sony’s entertainment side. After an internal review a couple of years ago, he came out swinging in favor of retaining Sony Pictures Entertainment, at a time when many in the film industry thought Sony no longer had the stomach for Hollywood. Hirai even took over as interim boss of SPE last year following the departure of Michael Lynton. Hirai said Friday that, as chairman, he would continue to advise Sony on matters, including entertainment.

For Yoshida, who as CFO has taken hard-headed financial decisions and implemented painful cuts, it may come down to a matter of scale. Sony Corp. currently weighs in with a valuation of $62 billion – small compared to the likes of a combined Disney-Fox, Time-Warner, Comcast and Viacom. Sony is even punier beside the new-media companies that will shape the next decade: Apple ($861 billion), Google ($816 billion), Amazon ($669 billion), Facebook ($561 billion), Tencent ($553 billion), and Alibaba ($492 billion).

The fact that Sony’s Picture Division has returned to modest profitability could be used as an argument both for keeping and for unloading it. The success of “Jumanji: Return to the Jungle” means that Sony Pictures Entertainment has a healthy new franchise on its hands on top of some other recent hits. Equally, however, getting back in the black makes SPE easier to sell – to someone like Rupert Murdoch, for example.

More so than their Western competitors, many Asian companies continue to espouse the virtues of a conglomerate structure, and to believe in having hardware and software under a single roof. Hirai appeared to believe in that path for Sony, and favored maintaining its entertainment assets as well as its tech ones.

Now it is Yoshida who will likely make the decision whether to sell or to bulk up Sony’s film, TV and music operations. Analysts say he might have other things to worry about first, such as the possible sales of Sony’s phone handset business, its home entertainment and audio consumer goods businesses, and its stakes in Sony Financial and Olympus cameras.

If those happen, Sony would have the cash for more acquisitions, including in the entertainment sphere. Whether it has the appetite is another question.

snack-fu-bling;1517663890;7uz991;;12;;12;"It’s about the NFL. Also, why tech should buy media.

CBS, home of broad-based hits like “NCIS” and “Big Bang Theory,” is exploring a tie-up with Viacom, which owns Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central, as well as Paramount studios. Both are controlled by entrepreneur Shari Redstone, and while it makes sense on the surface why she’d want to merge the two, it’s short-sighted.


Redstone should sell CBS to Amazon instead.

Here’s why. Combining two media businesses at a time when fewer people are paying for (or watching) TV won’t help either of them, even in the near term. But selling to a tech company like Amazon would allow CBS to more effectively compete with other networks by bidding higher for sports rights — the only content that still keeps mass audiences tied to TV sets — while at the same time getting ahead of TV’s inevitable shift to online distribution.

CBS would also have much more money to spend on itself under Amazon since Jeff Bezos would let it operate the Amazon way — without having to worry about profits. He prefers using money to boost the business, and the math on CBS is compelling.

Amazon’s operating margin is 3 percent — CBS is at 21 percent (welcome to media). Even halving that would yield an extra $1.3 billion that CBS could better spend on itself. The company also pays a dividend that costs $292 million a year — money that could go back into the network under Amazon.

It’s that simple.

But, of course, it’s also not. The hard part — there are a lot of hard parts, really, which we’ll address with all the proper asides — is getting at the narrative reason, the gut call for such an unconventional play.

So before flicking through the above thesis to lay out the business case (and there’s plenty there), let’s pause to consider: Bezos has become something of a media apparition these days. He’s the guy who owns two Beverly Hills homes and sits at the back table of the Golden Globes; the tuxedo’d gent grinning alongside Hollywood headliners at the latest premiere; the out-of-sight proprietor of a newly potent Washington Post.

He’s not always seen or heard, but he’s increasingly there, in the background or at the margins. On occasion, front and center, pitching his product.

His conspicuous public presence tells us the most important thing: Bezos simply likes media. He probably loves it. It’s the only real reason anyone ever gets into the business, and that postulate is more important than any business case.

But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t go through that case.

Tech companies not only have all the money right now, they also have a lot of the eyeballs. Google and Facebook in particular have captured a lot of user attention, often at the expense of TV. And it’s that state of play that’s fueling the cacophony of media deals at the moment. Redstone’s move to merge CBS and Viacom, AT&amp;T’s bid for Time Warner and Disney’s play for Fox’s film studios are all grand, last-ditch efforts to defend against tech, not each other.

The working theory is that by aggregating TV networks, a merged company could bargain for more carriage fees from the pay TV distributors like Charter or Comcast. CBS, for example, could help Viacom extract higher rates for its lesser-watched channels like MTV and Comedy Central by including them with its broadcast network, which is considered “must carry” given its highly rated programs and NFL games.

Some version of that thesis has been the boilerplate paragraph news articles have recycled to explain the rationale behind these multi-billion dollar mergers. It’s also wrong. The days of pay TV distributors continuing to shell out more for channels that fewer people are watching are over. These tie-ups aren’t about extracting more money. They’re about making sure they don’t get paid any less. They’re about staying alive.

Close observers and analysts have seen this story unfolding like a slow-motion massacre. TV ratings and subscribers are down. Contractually triggered rate increases have helped, but those rate hikes will be blunted in the next contract cycle.

Too downbeat? Here’s the thing: Even if the media mergers above (see chart) come to pass, that wouldn’t overturn the kernel truth that fewer people are paying for TV. And that trend will continue.

The idea of a CBS merger with a Silicon Valley company isn’t entirely speculative. The network’s top brass, including CEO Les Moonves, have mulled how the broadcaster could benefit under the ownership of a tech giant, according to sources. And he’s still wary of a tie-up with Viacom, even though they’re now formally looking at a merger, these people say.

It may seem Amazon wouldn’t need the help of CBS since it has already produced several critical hits, having made Bezos an awards-season regular since 2015 when the company was honored for its series “Transparent.”

But — and here’s where it makes sense to own CBS — a show about a Los Angeles family whose 70-year-old patriarch comes out as transgender is ultimately a niche product. Recent Amazon Globe winner “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” a period confection about a midcentury housewife trying to make it as a standup comedian, is a niche product, too.

Amazon was happy with niche hits when it started making its own shows. But now, Bezos wants Amazon Studios to think bigger, “Game of Thrones” bigger. Amazon’s abiding ethos is mass volume, the operating metric that unifies its catholic interests, and CBS happens to be the most-watched channel on television. While it’s broad-based programming isn’t exactly a swashbuckling fantasy epic, it knows how to draw big audiences.

That matters to Bezos, not just for the accolades or the party premieres, but because the more people watch Amazon’s shows, the more stuff they buy on Amazon.

“When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes,” Bezos has said at Code Conference. As an Amazon Prime member, you’re offered free two-day shipping on many items while also getting access to original shows. Put it another way, the shows, for now, are a marketing cost.

“Because we have this unusual way to monetize the premium content, we can charge less for the premium content than we would otherwise have to charge, if we didn’t have the flywheel spinning to help sell more shoes,” he explained.

But right now, Amazon’s future programming slate is unclear as it hunts for someone to lead its studios division. Its previous head, Roy Price, resigned in the wake of sexual harassment allegations. Amy Powell, the head of Paramount TV, and Nancy Dubuc, the CEO of A+E, have been seen as candidates, along with former Sony Pictures co-CEO Amy Pascal. Stacey Snider, the head of 20th Century Fox, is also a logical choice since it’s unclear what will happen to her and the studio’s top execs after Rupert Murdoch sells the studio to Disney.

CBS has had some modest digital success thanks to execs like Jim Lanzone, who leads the broadcaster’s digital division. The company’s standalone streaming service, CBS All Access, along with Showtime’s online service (also a CBS property), together now have four million paying subscribers, a figure the company expects to double by 2020. A lot of that was boosted by Amazon already, since it sells those services through its website.

Within Amazon, CBS could have immediate access to the over 60 percent of U.S. households that have a Prime membership, or about 75 million. Even though CBS already reaches 90 percent of those households, the bulk of that comes through pay TV subscriptions, which, as we’ve already noted, are in decline.

But the real prize — for both — is sports.

Professional leagues still dominate the ratings, making it increasingly valuable to advertisers and media companies in the age of fast-forward television. The NFL, despite recent viewership declines, is still the most valuable content anywhere. That’s why marketers still line up to pay $5 million to own 30 seconds of the Super Bowl.*

Where this matters for Amazon and CBS is their combined spending and distribution power. Amazon has the money; CBS has the audience and the programming expertise.

Amazon already paid big for streaming rights to Thursday night games, so Bezos clearly sees the benefit to owning sports, but viewership was lackluster. (The NFL just completed a renewal for Thursday TV rights going to Fox, but streaming rights are still being negotiated.)

CBS, meanwhile, has no problem driving big viewership to NFL games, but it’s paying a pretty penny for the right to do so — about $1.2 billion a year — and those fees will go even higher when the traditional Sunday and Monday games come up for grabs in 2021-2022.** The common wisdom is that a tech giant will snatch away those rights from the TV guys.

But the NFL has also seen what the NFL looks like on the internet and it’s not pretty. Thursday night games on Twitter barely got past 300,000 viewers, at least in terms of a Nielsen equivalent. Amazon did marginally better.

That means it’s doubtful the NFL will offer exclusive or near exclusive rights to an internet player no matter how much they bid. The NFL will still need a CBS or a Fox to make sure enough real people are tuning in.

Amazon and Facebook and Google, however, are less likely to pay big money for games that only draw a few hundred thousand viewers. They’d want scale, and for a deal to be meaningful they’d need to own sole rights — games you can only watch on the internet. (Verizon owns the mobile rights for now.)

Solution: An Amazon-CBS would allow one company to own both ends of the video spectrum right away, while also allowing it to experiment more quickly, possibly making a few games available only online while maintaining the bulk of NFL games on broadcast.

That’s a long walk to rationalize a merger that would cost Amazon $28 billion and would be its largest ever acquisition.*** But Amazon, more than any other enterprise, has shown an ambition that puts the Roman Empire in a gauzier light.

Adding binge-worthy serials and NFL games (or other pro sports) will certainly “sell more shoes.” But even then there’s also the draw of being a bigger player in media. Look at that photograph.

Requisite reality check (saved for last): There are some key reasons a deal like this is unlikely to happen.

First, the Redstone family. As controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone has sole say over the future of CBS and Viacom. Combining the two would likely mean a contraction of both. Viacom has already started to slim down, which is smart, but it will still be a weight on CBS.

Of course, she wants to combine the two not necessarily because it’s the best home for Viacom but because she can simply make it happen, and time is running out in media merger land. If she doesn’t combine it with the more valuable company, CBS, soon, Viacom’s value could drop.

A better idea (though a harder one to pull off) would be to sell off Viacom to a different buyer. Disney is already in the process of bulking up by purchasing Fox’s studio assets, but that deal doesn’t include a cable network as big as Nickelodeon or MTV.

Disney’s deal for Fox has partly been about shoring up ESPN with Fox’s regional sports networks. Adding Nickelodeon and MTV to Disney’s smaller cable networks — Disney channel and Freeform, a channel aimed at teens — would create a stronger lineup than the one that has Viacom added to CBS, or one that Disney would have without those networks. The caveat to such a deal, of course, is everything said above, but it solves a problem for Redstone while maximizing a takeout price.

The other reason this deal is unlikely to happen: The chaotic and oftentimes personally driven regulatory environment created by the Trump Administration. Trump has already cast doubt on the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger, and he’s unlikely to look favorably on anything Jeff Bezos might do that would make Amazon even more powerful.

But that doesn’t mean it still couldn’t happen. And while the smart play isn’t always the one that actually happens, it’s one always worth spelling out.

The Walt Disney company was founded in 1923 by two brothers- Walter ""Walt"" E Disney and Roy O Disney- it was a cartoon studio creating the popular Mickey Mouse character in 1928, got into animated films with Snow White in 1937, live-action in 1950, open it first theme park in 1955, and few years before that into  television, the brothers past away, few hit and misses, Michael Eisner became Chairman and CEO in 1984, a Disney renaissance began. Disney Channel launched in 1983.Disney became the first and still the only media and entertainment company on the Dow 30, Disney buys ABC and ESPN for $19 Billion, Disney became the largest M+E (Media and Entertainment) company by revenue, Disney buys Fox Family (now FreeForm) for $5 Billion, another hits and misses, Comcast nearly bought them. Iger replaced Eisner in 2005. Disney make a deal with Steve Jobs, buys Pixar in 2005 for $7 Billion to dominate the Animated film genre, buys Marvel Entertainment in 2009 for $4 Billion to be a pop culture powerhouse, buys Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4 Billion to own Star Wars the biggest sci-fi franchise in history.

And if approved will make the New Walt Disney Co. a company with $75 Billion in annual revenue, $15-20 Billion profit and cash flow, and a market capitalization of $230-250 Billion. New Disney will be owned 75% by their shareholders, and 25% by Fox shareholders (in that the Murdoch family will own 5%). Disney will become the largest film and TV company on earth with content library that even makes Time Warner's Warner Bros. looks like an upstart media company, they will also own a stake in Sky the largest pay TV service in Europe, STAR India with 900 million subscribers (yeah that number is right), Hotstar with 100 million paying subscribers, Fox Sports Regionals will make ESPN a dominant sport brand locally, nationally, and International. ABC Studios fused with 20th Century Television will become the second largest TV studio on earth after Time Warner's WBTV. And Disney's Marvel will own all of the characters again excluding Spider-Man and Hulk which are owned by Sony and Comcast's Universal respectively. it also give Disney which is more family-focused adult-themed brands like FX which can compete with HBO and Starz in terms of programming and awards.  And with streaming services such as Hulu (which they will now own 60% controlling interest), Disney-branded service and ESPN, Disney will become the largest media, entertainment, and technology company to have ever existed in History.

snack-fu-bling;1517678582;7v0muw;;5;;0;"It’s not as ridiculous as you may think


Microsoft needs help when it comes to exclusive games for the Xbox One, and acquiring developers or publishers with a great game selection is the easiest way to get that help.

But Valve is an unlikely source of relief for Microsoft. Valve doesn’t need the money, and few people involved with the company, studio head Gabe Newell included, have any reason to sell. But it’s still reported that Newell owns the majority of Valve, and it often appears from the outside as if Valve is more or less on cruise control. If Newell wanted to focus on something else in his later years, this would be a good chance to make a clean break while pocketing a fortune.

Besides, Newell wouldn’t be the first person who has claimed not to like Microsoft only to be convinced by a huge check.

But what would Microsoft get with that purchase?

MICROSOFT COULD BUY PC GAMING WITH ONE ACQUISITION

Steam owns a huge chunk, if not the majority, of PC gaming in the United States. People use the service to buy games, developers use the service to sell games and Valve takes a cut of everything that happens on the platform. Microsoft is interested in PC gaming for the obvious reasons, but it lacks the exclusive games that would draw players to its own substandard online stores and services. That would change overnight if Microsoft controlled Steam.

But buying and selling games is only part of Steam’s value, as Microsoft would also control one of the most useful means of collecting user data in all of gaming. Microsoft would learn about what hardware is in the systems of players who agree to share that data, and it would know what games people are playing and for how long. If data is power these days, Steam is the equivalent of a nuclear bomb stuffed with hundred-dollar bills.

That metaphor may have gotten away from me a bit, but you understand what I mean. Microsoft would profit from every sale on the platform, while also being able to cash in on the data it could learn from player behavior.

It might be hard for Microsoft to convince its shareholders to pay that much for a company so strongly centered on gaming, when that hasn’t historically been a major profit center for the company, but CEO Satya Nadella has spoken about the company’s upgraded interest in gaming.

“We’re mobilizing to pursue an expansive opportunity in the 100+ billion gaming market,” Nadella stated near the end of 2017. “This means broadening our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end. About starting with games and how they’re created and distributed, and how they’re played and viewed.”

And Valve would earn Microsoft money from day one while pouring data into Microsoft’s brain. These two things in concert would make one hell of a slide deck for anyone skeptical of the acquisition internally.

That’s not to mention the profits generated from games like Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which would allow Microsoft to be a major player in competitive gaming from the first day it took over Valve’s assets. Microsoft would be grabbing control over games that pull in ridiculous amounts of money while also gaining a leadership position in the growing world of esports.

Which brings us to the last point about this potential acquisition: Microsoft would gain the mother of all exclusives.

HALF-LIFE 3

Laugh all you want. Star Wars was a joke too, until Disney bought Lucasfilm and threw money and talent at bringing the franchise back. And that seems to be going OK.

Half-Life 3 has been a running joke in the video game industry for so long that it’s hard to imagine anything actually happening with it, but that’s mostly because Valve itself doesn’t have much of an incentive to go back to the series. The company is making too much money on everything else to “waste” time or energy on a follow-up to one of the most beloved games of all time.

MICROSOFT WOULD BE GRABBING CONTROL OVER GAMES THAT PULL IN RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY

But Microsoft sure as hell has a reason to invest in Half-Life 3 if it were ever given the opportunity.

Imagine a future in which Microsoft owns Valve and puts Half-Life 3 on the development fast track, throwing money at the original creative team and aiming for an “exclusive” release on Windows PC and Xbox One. PC players wouldn’t even lose anything because they’d finally be getting the sequel they always wanted, and they would be able to buy it on Steam. A version of Steam that’s controlled by Microsoft, sure, but the point stands.

Hell, Microsoft could ship it as part of a Purple Box with Left 4 Dead 3 and Portal 3, which are other series that have sat dormant as Valve rakes in the cash from its other ventures. Valve is sitting on a wealth of IP that’s severely underutilized, and Microsoft has all the reasons in the world to bring all these exclusives out of retirement.

IT’S AN ACQUISITION THAT MAKES TOO MUCH SENSE TO HAPPEN
Microsoft needs to make a big move to try to take control of gaming, and the most powerful console in the world is just one step toward that goal. Buying Valve, for whatever the cost would be, would help the company in every possible way.

The acquisition would likely pay for itself with time, Microsoft would have access to the data of all those PC gamers, and the exclusives problem would disappear with the day-and-date announcement of Half-Life 3’s development.

Look at it this way: Why bother buying PUBG when the game is already a timed exclusive on your platform and you could instead own the store on which it’s sold? Microsoft would have a lock on the PC gaming space in a way it can only dream of right now, and all it would take is this one acquisition.

Is this going to happen? It’s unlikely, but it’s not impossible. And Microsoft is just the company to write a check with enough zeroes to make it happen.

I know they've announced a lot of deals, but the price fell despite developments since early Jan. I've held on since the initial drop was actually steady enough for me to at least hold, but at its current price, I'm starting to worry a bit.

I started ""investing"" (ik... acorns is probably a shitty way to do it) about two months ago, and acorns picks the stocks for me. Idk if its picking well, but it follows the trends.. 

Anywho, my previous idea was ""Hey, as long as I'm making money, I'll stick around"" but currently to -$20 from the $50 I was a week ago with about $1000 in the fund.

I feel like I've got a couple options, but have no real knowledge of the market or when to make moves.. so

1. Cancel my roundups, but let it ride.. just see what happens, maybe pull out if I get to like -$50 or something..

2. Pull out... decide I don't wanna run with the big dogs and dip...

3. Drop another $1000 in while everything is super low. Big dog, big nuts. How should I do this to minimize loss though? Wait until the first turn up, then buy?";;As a total newb to stocks, who has been playing with Acorns for fun... what should I do here?;
masuraj;1517866725;7vi8g5;;2;;2;"Sorry as I am guessing this will be a dumb questions but here it goes:

So I understand there is a stock market device called buying on margin where you can borrow money, plug it into the stock market and you get tagged an interest rate for borrowing that money.  Hopefully I am using this term correctly.  Anyways....with the market being as positive as it HAD been up until the last week was it becoming extremely common for investors to use this device?

I only ask as I am trying to understand the meltdown today.  SO many positive things in the economy right now, unemployment showing well, corporate tax breaks, etc.  Is there a possibility that investors/traders had been getting EXTREMELY over-leveraged thinking that this trend was going to keep on keepin on?  Therefore, investors/traders maybe had higher pressure to get out of their positions to make sure they didn't get killed not only on a losing stock but then owing the interest?

Again, sorry for these probably very dumb questions but just trying to better understand a couple market vehicles and concepts.

bitlexa;1517897826;7vlfkq;;3;;1;Over the past few days, and particularly over the past 24 hours news on Wall Street has gone from hyper-optimistic to downright depressing. One article declared we’d come to “The end of the market’s Trump honeymoon”, others are analyzing not whether or not major correction is underway, but whether or not the correction will lead to a “multiyear bear market”. The change in sentiment is startling, and it’s been almost perfectly mimicked by the crypto market. Watching this play out has caused two questions to arise: firstly how strong the correlation between traditional financial markets and the cryptocurrency markets is and secondly if the correlation exists what the implications of today could be for [cryptocurrencies](http://www.bitlex.win/2018/02/how-todays-stock-markets-crash-will.html).;;How Today’s Stock Markets Crash Will Affect Cryptocurrency Markets;

grittygatorr;1517921535;7vn422;;3;;0;"Trading crypto currencies is a brilliant way to make money, however, it isn’t as simple as many portray it to be.

Each type of currency has several different underlying factors which affect the price of it.

Bitcoin has certainly been the most successful one, but that’s mainly because of its wide acceptance. Especially if you go on to shop anything out on the dark web, you’ll wonder if Bitcoin is greater than USD.

So why am I reading this? Where is the secret potion that makes me millions overnight while I vacation in my private yacht anchored off the coast of Fiji Islands ?

And the answer is -

ZERO.

There is nothing online, offline, in-person, on call that can tell you where to put your money in, come back a few months later, and wake up to portfolio gains of +742%. Those blogs you read and Videos you saw ? They know as much about it as you do. Just like a scammy Indian Godman.

You see, we are so lost in finding answers and attaching meaning to random outcomes, that we fail to understand the why.

Causality states that worldly agencies, or phenomena through which one thing (the cause) under certain conditions gives rise to, causes something else (the effect).

What it doesn’t state is that there are a gazillion variables happening all together at the same time, which cause the final effect as it is.

That’s the same with Markets. There are a 100 different things that affect every increase in cent of a particular coin or token. Any one who tells you with conviction that X coin is going 2x in a month, is probably BSing, shilling, being overly optimistic, or driving the price up to dump it all when X reaches a favorable price.

You don’t wanna be THAT guy.

A trader, at least the ones I know and speak with, would never state a particular price or be sure about where X would be in a few days. They know it doesn’t work that way, and even in the most bullish settings, the market is governed by ten other factors each second, which you have no control over, and will drastically affect the outcome.

And when it comes to the Crypto market, these effects are amplified.

Think about it.

You spend a day trading Coin X you picked over the past week. Followed the trends, completed a careful fundamental analysis, and since the market is bullish, invested all your funds into it because, it is only going up right ?

You pour yourself the finest scotch, snuggled into the Thai silk pyjamas, and kiss your wife goodnight. (That last Ripple rally went really well).

Lights off. Goodnight. I am waking up to great returns.

I earn money while sleeping.

Did I mention the Crypto market runs 247365 ?

While you sleep, a Chinese official decides to ban cryptocurrencies.

You see right there there can be various political motivations and anti-monopolistic sentiments and so forth. But what’s at the mercy of this prejudice is your beloved portfolio. One that you forgot to set the stop-losses on.

Hearing this news, the Chinese quickly offload what they can. Someone tweets about this development and the Koreans think the next country to ban crypto is theirs. The FUD spreads. The Ozzies watch the price going south and begin to sell-off, followed by the Indians, the Arabs (not that they need crypto to get rich), and in a few hours, this thing hits Europe. Reddit catches hold and the subreddits go crazy. Hackernoon articles are written. 4chan is busy making memes. Buzzfeed reports that Bitcoin has finally burst, people who didn’t invest further get a point to prove themselves right.

Eight hours later, you wake up to a bloodbath. Your beloved portfolio is red everywhere. The news is awash with crypto obituaries. “Experts” are giving their own opinions on the issue. And you catch yourself asking “What the F just happened ?”

What happened Uncle Sam, is that while you slept, the world wept.

Dejected, and to salvage any remaining profits you can to fund that Thailand trip you thought of in your head, you proceed to sell off your positions at a loss. Why did I even get into this in the first place ?

Two days later,a tabloid in China reports the ban is uplifted.

If you think this was hypothetical, I highly suggesting googling “Cryptocurrency crash august 2017"". Except that China didn’t really lift the ban on cryptocurrencies yet.

The point is, such things happen, and no one can tell you where the price of X will be two days, two hours, two minutes later. No One. And hence, you should take such advice with a pinch of salt.

Obviously it isn’t everyday that such news happens, but there are times when a lot of investors are leaving a particular coin, which would hence bring the price down.

With experience and usage of trading indicators, you learnt to predetermine when the market is going south, and get out of the market safeguarding both your profit and crypto-dignity.

What happens is, that you learn to pick up the fishing rod, attach the bait, and fish for yourself. That way, you definitely know if the fish you caught is high quality Bluefin Tuna, or a sardine.

Like I said before. Each type of currency has several different underlying factors which affect the price of it.

Such news can happen all the time. But instead of losing all of your investment, you set stop-loss, identify a hedge, and in the event of such a catastrophe, DO NOT end up selling your position.

The market is here to stay and Blockchain is the future. Period.

The most powerful economies identify technology and how it helps them, and use it to their advantage to leapfrog in economic growth. It would be ten steps backwards for a nation to ban cryptocurrencies, in a time when the tug-of-power is at it’s highest.

It would take a strong stomach to accept losses, but even stronger hands to avoid panic selling.

Not that I advocate the famous “HODLing”, which is not a great strategy to follow when you trade, or even invest.

Understanding the Nature of the Crypto Market

The first and most important thing you need to know about bitcoin in particular, and cryptocurrency in general is that “cryptocurrency” is a slight misnomer.

Of course, there are stores and brokers who accept bitcoin and this number is increasing by the day. Houses, cars and Helicopters have been purchased by bitcoin. Coffee has been bought with Stellar Lumens. Litecoin has been used to purchase products according to some report.

However, 95% of the people do not treat Bitcoin or other coins as a “currency”. Rather, it is more of a financial commodity, an asset that is powered by the technology of the future, and that would a great ROI years down the line.

The value of these crypto-assets hence come from their potential uses.

In fact, most of the altcoins that are traded are not stores-of-value. Instead, they are backed by products and firms which aim to create a dent in the relevant industry.

A Chinese coin (V3N) aims to disrupt the supply chain industry with it’s unique RFID offering that detects counterfeit products.

Genesis Vision (GVT) is a new decentralized platform that aims to bring exchanges, brokers, traders and investors together. This shall be a completely transparent platform to facilitate lending between professional traders and investors.

Icon (ICX) provides unique blockchain solutions to banks, hospitals, and universities. The South Koreans are yet to discover this one — a coin of their own.

0x (ZRX) is a protocol that allows for the decentralized exchange of ERC-20 tokens, basically, any token that runs on the Ethereum blockchain

And just like these, there are 100s of coins out there, backed by solid teams and an industry which they aim to disrupt.

It’s the global stock market of the future.

By understanding this, we move from a temporary, 100x overnight returns mindset to a permanent, slow and steady 2x per month returns mindset.

Investing in solid technologies builds a strong portfolio.

One that has the potential to reach seven figures in a few years.

But like many unknown commodities, crypto-assets are subject to market risks and price volatility. This aspect is seen by some an a HUGE opportunity, while others want to keep as far as they can.

Thus, it is very essential to not throw around money based on what a YouTuber, Instragrammer, or celebrity said. It is likely they have vested interests in those projects, which is why people have heard more about Tron or Bitconnect, instead of a Waltonchain or Loopring.

WAIT ! I usually see graphs and candles and listen various other terms when people talk about trading. Where is all of that ?

We haven’t reached the part of selling our fish yet. At least not the fish we identified to be A-1 material. And we sure as hell aren’t selling the ship !

In every portfolio, it is very essential to keep the majority of it as a trusted investment. One you believe in, one which would sell for a much higher price in the future after demand for that coin increases, and the supply is you.

For this reason, we take a fundamental approach towards analyzing this part of the portfolio. Evaluating a security in an attempt to measure its intrinsic value, by examining related economic, financial and other qualitative and quantitative factors.

Crypto-assets, for the long time to come, will always be an unknown commodity. They simply don’t have the technical indicators of the traditional stock market which are usually used to analyze an asset.

Most stocks or bonds can be analyzed based on some trait of the instrument. Stocks have P/E ratios and dividends, for example, while bonds have return percentages. Crypto-assets have no fundamentals that can be easily measured.

Does this mean we don’t have to see any graphs ?

Of course you will. And now that we have finished this part of the article, and the portfolio, we move on to the number crunching work. The part where we catch hold of market sentiments of a particular coin, and trade using price-action for returns on the investment.

What this does is, it creates two sources of income. One, the income we get from investing, holding and swing trading ground-breaking, technology backed digital assets, and two, the coins that see a lot of price movements, where we reap our profit out from, before identifying and moving on to the next coins where we do the same.

Just like the traditional markets, a few companies become worth Billions, a few become unicorns and fizzle out, while a few show great promise and meet with an end, or a corporate takeover a few years down the line.

Hence, like every stock, we can’t expect every coin to be a constant part of the portfolio permanently.

There’s some fish you hang as a trophy, some you put in your aquarium, and some you sear with olive oil in a pan.

Computers can’t risk like humans can. But what happens when **every** single investment bank is trying to “limit risk”? Then nobody is risking.

I was most certainly wrong, all of those brokers were used to an active routine (brokerage firms and trading groups recruited ex-football players who were agile with long armspans who can yell and shout loud) of jumping up and down, with five or six telephones wrapped around their necks, with order cards that they throw like japanese throwing stars, and the time-stamps that go “chu-chunk” that experienced traders can bounce cards in an out of from yards away, screaming and joking around with the soybean traders, arguing back and forth, and so on.

The acceleration date is expected to be February 21, 2018. Since the intraday indicative value of XIV on February 5, 2018 was equal to or less than 20% of the prior day’s closing indicative value, an acceleration event has occurred. Credit Suisse expects to deliver an irrevocable call notice with respect to the event acceleration of XIV to The Depository Trust Company by no later than February 15, 2018. The date of the delivery of the irrevocable call notice, which is expected to be February 15, 2018, will constitute the accelerated valuation date, subject to postponement due to certain events. The acceleration date for XIV is expected to be February 21, 2018, which is three business days after the accelerated valuation date. On the acceleration date, investors will receive a cash payment per ETN in an amount equal to the closing indicative value of XIV on the accelerated valuation date. The last day of trading for XIV is expected to be February 20, 2018. As of the date hereof, Credit Suisse will no longer issue new units of XIV ETNs. On February 2, 2018, the closing indicative value was USD 108.3681. None of the other ETNs offered by Credit Suisse are affected by this announcement. ";;XIV being liquidated!;

* Earnings: Loss of 13 cents a share vs. 16 cents per share estimated, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate


Snap soared after an earnings report that beat analyst expectations, with shares jumping up to 28 percent during after-hours trading.

The company reported Q4 earnings on Tuesday after the bell:

Revenue: $285.7 million versus $252.9 million estimated, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate
Earnings: Loss of 13 cents a share vs. 16 cents per share estimated, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate

Global daily active users (DAUs): 187 million vs. 184.2 million estimated, per FactSet and StreetAccount

Average revenue per user (ARPU) estimate: $1.53 vs. $1.36 estimated, per FactSet and StreetAccount
Though the company is still not profitable, it grew revenue 72 percent year-over-year and showed a 46 percent increase year-over-year in revenue ARPU. Cash burn decreased to $225 million, down 49 percent from the previous quarter.

Snap announced during the previous quarter it was redesigning its app to attract new users and usher in new ways to monetize its app. It began slowly rolling out changes in November 2017. Recently it announced would allow users to share some content across Twitter and Facebook, a first for the app which was initially built around disappearing messages.

GBH Insights chief strategy officer Daniel Ives said in a note the redesign should help attract older users, a key advertising target. He added advertisers are overall positive on the company, indicating sales and ad prices should increase. However, he acknowledged Snap faces many issues, including ARPUs that are below industry averages and competition from other social networks like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Instagram Stories, Facebook's Snapchat competitor, announced 300 million daily active users in November, although some reports have indicated users spend more time on Snap than on its rival.

Obviously, that was a big jump so options were pretty expensive, but on smaller corrections, what I like to do is buy put options when it spikes. Ask/bid spreads are still within pennies usually even for 12% corrections which makes them attractive, plus it is relatively predictable it will go back down.;;Easiest Speculative Option Out There:;

lykosen11;1518012145;7vw9n7;;36;;98;"Hello /r/Stockmarket

This is a very interesting time in the markets, and after a very extended bullrun, we have found us in a situation of a first correction, if you want to call it that. Some people might have felt their first fear during what happened here, and even if these points are said over and over everywhere, it bares repeating. As a very heavy fundamentals investor, I want to plug my own view on the situation.

There are many different ways of making financial investments. You can look at chart and technical indicators or you can look at trends and news. Or you can pick one of the many thousand ways to try to “guess” what the market will do in the future. Problem is, that tons of information is unreliable. You hear someone say something online, and you believe it. Maybe amazon is more expensive than apple because the individual shares costs more. Maybe you are told that all stocks @80 USD is worth 120 USD because of psychology. Perhaps you saw a chart that predicts the future using tons of lines you do not understand. I want to make this very clear. If you want to find a way to profit and learning you need one thing and one thing only.

**You need a plan.**

You need a strategy that will hold up. You can not be unsure about this plan. And this is something I preach CONSTANTLY. There is nothing stressful about the investing market, as long as you firmly believe in your own beliefs. If you evaluate $SQ to be worth $46, buy it at $40, and it drops to $30, you just lost 25% of your investment. Stressed? Well, you should not be. It’s about belief. The only reason you would be stressed if you doubt the reason you bought it. That is why absolute belief will remove all psyche issues with investing, and why it is so important to pick what you choose to put your belief in. 

I put my belief in fundamental analysis. It is the only thing I believe in. While technical analysis and trends are something that most definitely works to some extent, if the market drops, your trend or technical indicators stop mattering. Fundamentals is the only thing that do not change as the price of the company drops. And therefore I, among many other people, trust what you actually buys. If you buy a new laptop, you don't care about how the price change over time. It only matters what you are actually buying, how strong, fast or heavy the laptop is. Feel free to disagree, everyone should have their own belief. But once you picked your belief, it must be absolute, and it must be the correct way to see things.

**Before you buy a stock, always:**


Why am I getting this instead of an index?  

 Where is the upside?  


If the stock goes up, what action do I take?  

 When do I sell? At what price or % gain. What action do I take?  


If the stock goes down, when do I sell? At what % loss or a price. What action do I take? 

   
What risks are there?  

 How does the worst case realistic scenario look like?  


Why am I making this investment right now?   Is there a better time?  


What exactly am I buying?   


If you can’t answer these questions for every single equity, security or paper you own, you have failed. I choose fundamental analysis as my weapon, and I am absolute. **Are you?**

There is no more price discovery, no more working together, and no more deciphering who needs and who wants. All of what you see is a computer screen, with no openness whatsoever. 



Your retirement and almost all of your investments are matched by a computer within milliseconds; nobody even knows what’s happening anymore. When the quants took over, everyone shifted to the screen, whether they liked it or not. 



Dark pools are even worse. Most of the time, you don’t even know what your trade is until after it’s made. This is extremely dangerous because it’s difficult to tell which way the market is moving.

Everyone is trying to “limit risk” by having the robots do it for them. You need a human presence to keep everything well regulated and fair, and humans can easily make good financial decisions based on the football game, not the scoreboard. Yet you don’t have that anymore, which is sad. When everyone is trying to “limit risk”, **then nobody is risking**. You *need* risk to keep the markets good, but you still don’t have that anymore.

From what I understand, the recent plunge was driven by the economy being better than expected (low unemployment, higher than anticipated wages). This has caused fears that banks will increase interest rates, causing a large stock selloff. How accurate is this? And if so, why are banks allowed to do this? To someone outside of the financial/political sector, this seems like something where financial regulation should come into play and Congress (who bailed the banks out in 2008) should be able to step in and prevent banks from raising interest rates in the interest of the general population and overall economic growth.

snack-fu-bling;1518179112;7wd37l;;1;;4;"Twitter delivered the first profitable quarter in its nearly 12-year history — although it failed to increase its total monthly user base in the period.

The social network’s financial results handily beat Wall Street expectations. Twitter posted fourth quarter revenue of $732 million, up 2% year-over-year and reversing the trend of declining top-line numbers over the past few quarters.

In Q4, quarterly GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income was $91 million, versus a net loss of $167 million in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earning per share were 19 cents. Wall Street expected revenue of $687 million and EPS of 14 cents.

Twitter shares rocketed up more than 25% in premarket trading — hitting a two-year high. The company had previously said it “will likely” turn a profit in Q4 on a GAAP basis. Twitter achieved the profitable quarter by cutting overall spending 28% year-over-year, with the 9% cutback to its workforce at the end of 2016 contributing to the cost savings.

Twitter averaged 330 million monthly active users in Q4, unchanged from the previous quarter. In part, the company said that was because it stepped up efforts to shut down “spam, malicious automation, and fake accounts.” Analysts had anticipated 2 million MAU net adds in the period. In Q4 2016, Twitter gained an average 1 million monthly users.

“Q4 was a strong finish to the year,” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said in announcing the results. “We returned to revenue growth, achieved our goal of GAAP profitability, increased our shipping cadence, and reached five consecutive quarters of double-digit DAU [daily active user] growth. I’m proud of the steady progress we made in 2017, and confident in our path ahead.”

Although Twitter’s MAUs of 330 million for the quarter were flat, it was up 4% year-over-year. In addition, the company said average daily active users grew 12% year-over-year; Twitter doesn’t report number of DAUs.

According to Twitter, a change Apple made to the Safari browser’s third-party app integration resulted in a loss of approximately 2 million MAUs in Q4 (1 million in the U.S. and 1 million internationally). It also cited “seasonality and increased information-quality efforts” as affecting MAU growth. Monthly users in the U.S. averaged 68 million for the period, up 2% year-over-year and a decrease of 1 million quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the impact of the change in Safari.

On the revenue front, Twitter’s ad revenue on owned-and-operated platforms for Q4 was $593 million — up 7% year-over-year and a whopping 30% increase from the previous quarter. Twitter cited user-engagement growth and better sales execution as contributing to the lift. Video remains Twitter’s largest ad format and grew as a percent of total revenue in Q4.

During Q4, Twitter live-streamed around 1,140 events, with 60% of those reaching a global audience. In addition, 28 million live user-generated streams were broadcast in the quarter across Twitter and Periscope. The company announced 22 new live-streaming and VOD partnerships in the period. New partners launching in the quarter included TicToc by Bloomberg, a 24-hour live business-news channel, which has averaged 750,000 daily views since its mid-December launch.

Meanwhile, Twitter has continued to suffer from high-level executive exits. Last month, COO Anthony Noto left the company to join lending startup SoFi as chief executive. Dorsey began the earnings call by praising Noto’s contributions during his three and a half years at Twitter, calling him a “trusted partner” and wishing him well in his new gig. “We are not going to have to do any backfilling on the management team” with Noto’s departure, Dorsey added, saying other execs have stepped in to fulfill his duties.";;Twitter Posts First-Ever Profit on Strong Q4 Results as User Growth Stalls;

I'm considering doing more of these videos, but really don't know if there are many people that would be interested in them.  This video is a broad overview of the market in a longer term sense, but I can do intraday analysis as well and look at shorter term trade opportunities.  In this video I only talk about the S&amp;P 500.  If anybody has any interest in more specific content, let me know.  I can look at pretty much any index, stock, futures contract, or forex contract.  Please like and subscribe to my youtube channel if you're interested so I know to post more stuff.  If nobody is interested, then I'm not going to pollute the internet with more of my blabbering. 

About myself...  I studied David Elliot's trading method meticulously before he passed away. He used to have a chat room on the thinkorswim platform, and also had a private live trade room during the day where he mentored students.  David was passionate about the market and provided tons of free mentoring to the world in regards to technical analysis. I had the privilege of being in his trade room and following his trades in real time for a couple months and learned quite a bit from him. I want to carry on his tradition of sharing knowledge about the market and cultivating a group of like minded technical traders.  He used proprietary indicators, some of which are available for free through thinkorswim.  I use some of those as well as his ""Hinge"" indicator which isn't widely available.  My goal is to post daily market reviews for a broad subscriber base and -  optimistically -  I would like to host a live trade room where we trade futures and / or options.

lykosen11;1518378521;7wv1rm;;90;;157;"Hello /r/stockmarket!

Even in these tough times, I keep chopping away at the research and analysis that I always do. Today's write-up is about Alphabet Inc, more commonly known as the parent company of Google (Ticker: $GOOGL). As always, this is my own fundamental analysis, and the write-up that follows. I employ trend research and discounted cash flow analysis, and it is fully up to you if you want to take anything here written as fact. Numbers and information is taken from the 4th quarter of 2017 and earlier. That said, here is my view of Alphabet Inc.
__________
**The company**  
Alphabet is an holding and parent company of many subsidiaries, focusing on technology. What kind of technology you ask? Well, a ton of it. Here is a list of some of the subsidiaries that Alphabet has under its massive technological wing:

* Google, an internet company focusing on it’s famous search engine, advertising business and video service through Youtube. It goes without saying that Google is by far the largest and most profitable of Alphabets businesses.
* Calico, a R&amp;D biotech company
* Chronicle, a cybersecurity and anti-hacking company
* Dandelion, a geothermal energy startup company.
* DeepMind, an Artificial intelligence company
* GV (Google venture), a strategic investment company
* CapitalG (Google Capital), a profit-directed investment company
* Google fiber, a developer for fiber networking and an ISP 
* Nest Labs, a home automation company. Develops programmable home appliances. 
* Jigsaw (Google Ideas), a tech incubator company, focusing on unique technology
* Sidewalk labs, urban innovation company, developer within infrastructure and urban technology.
*  Verily (Google X), life-science research and development company
* Waymo, world leading company in autonomous driving

As you can see, the list of technological focuses is incredibly broad. Alphabet is an ad company that puts all its profits into developing thousands of products to revolutionize the future.

  __________

**Fundamentals &amp; Forecasts**   
Alphabet has a annual revenue of $110,8 billion, resulting in a gross profit of $66,5 billion and a net profit (earnings) of $13,9 billion. That is an 24% increase in revenue year to year (y/y). Alphabets numbers are slightly jumbled up recently as this quarter, like many other tech giants in the US following the tax reform of the new year, moved huge amount of international profits into the US. This resulted in alphabets tax rate for Q4 2017 to become 138% of their pre-tax income. We have to adjust for this one time payment, as Alphabet moves that money into the country to invest in their capital expenditure and R&amp;D. The company has a historical tax rate of roughly 18-19%, which is very low. Also of note, Alphabet has during the last 2 years fairly consistently increased their R&amp;D spending by 20% y/y each quarter, really highlighting how the company is putting more and more money into their technology R&amp;D. Their general operating margin is roughly 60%, which is also very high, but not uncommon in the ad market. A last notion to mention is that Alphabet is after their intake of additional saved up international cash very net cash positive, with a war chest of $97 billion. As a huge part of Alphabet is founding its own startups, acquiring other startups that have potential and investing in either one, their huge war chest is a very strong advantage for them to have. 

Alphabet is huge. It’s enormous. This makes forecasting complicated as they can have huge swings if their profitability goes down, and it could be very hard to recover. I preface the next message with this, so you as a reader is aware. Alphabet right now has amazing fundamentals. The company is incredibly strong. They have the historical income numbers of a growth company, while being profitable and stable. These are facts that make Alphabet very fundamentally sound.

 If we assume that Alphabet reached their growth peak in 2017, and from there have a steady growth slowdown until they run into a complete growth-stop in 2030, as well as maintained tax rate (20%), gross (&amp; operating) margin (60% respective 23%), we still see upside in its current price. These calculations were done at a -3% maturity rate, along with a discount rate of 7%. These are fairly standard industry numbers. Using this pessimistic view of the company in my eyes, seeing no further improvement, the net present stock value would end up at $1199, a valuation upside of 15% after the recent drop. The more realistic scenario is the same, except that we maintain the current growth for the coming year, and then seeing a slower maturity drop until the growth-stop, we see an 34% upside, $1402. 

  __________


**Concerns &amp; Risk**  
The recent discussions about Alphabet is its issues with TAC, traffic acquisition cost. That is the cost that Alphabet pays to get traffic to their services, where the expense is increasing and margins decreasing fairly rapidly. At the beginning of 2016, the ad revenue of $18 million was hurt by a TAC of $3.7 million, which is an TAC cost of sale of 21% of the ad revenue. These numbers increased to $21.4 million, $4.63 million and 21.6% respectively. Now, at the end of 2017, the TAC expense grows 11.5% faster than the ad revenue. This is clearly a problem for Google as a service, and as their margins fall, this causes real concern about their profitability. If we apply a lowering margin down from a VERY consistent 60% gross margin after cost of sales, down 1% per year down to 53%, we see the net present evaluation drop to 946 per share, a -10% downside. This is a real risk, and is the scenario where Google slowly loses its iron grasp on the ad industry. The very realistic scenario, the middle ground, is where Alphabets margins drop from their consistent 60%, to 56% by 2020. 56% gross margin was what happened this last quarter, Q417, which caused the 10% drop in value along with uncertainties in the overall market. If Alphabet never recovers from this drop in margin, their current valuation is fair. If they recover but slowly struggle down to 56% again, even slowly down to 53%,  they have a very slight downside. As you can see, this is a potential problem for Google. It is worth pointing out that this drop is very abrupt, a blip, and is no proof of any sort of a trend. A similar company, Facebook $FB, has a gross margin of 87%, which shows that higher margins is also attainable.

  __________


**My view**  
Alphabet has been my personal favorite company since I became an adult, which makes me slightly biased. I am happy to report that my financial knowledge tells me that they also deserve the praise I give them personally. The company is amazing, attaining growth numbers that shouldn’t happen to large businesses like this. Most analysts are right to worry about the recent decline in gross margins, but if these are improved, they should be a catalyst that removes the sliver of doubt that is the only thing holding Alphabets price down. I will most certainly hold Alphabet through that. It is such a diverse business, deep into the future of tech, supported by the greatest ad company this world have ever seen. They are regulated hard to leave their main product, Google search engine, unbiased as if they were greedy with it, could dominate any market. That power is impossible to put a $ on.

I personally believe that Google is a perfect buying opportunity for a very long term investment. They will get their margins back on track, their excellent management fully understand this. It might not be the next quarter, it might not be the quarter after that. However, if we assume that their operating margins look very realistic, bordering pessimistic, and that they recover their margin issue over the next 4 years, their net present stock value is $1236, a 18% upside. This doesn’t make Alphabet a snap purchase, but it makes them a fair purchase. When you buy Alphabet you buy a sliver of the future. They have their hand in every single futuristic technology, everything from Biotech to AI and self-driving cars, to VR/AR to the internet of things. They are industry leaders in all of these (barring biotech, tough industry). When these markets become profitable in the future, your good purchase of Alphabet today becomes an excellent hedge into the R&amp;D of the future.

I bought Alphabet right before the drop of 10%. My only mistake is that I did not buy more. However, it turned out fine since it tanked. I am happy people doubt their margins because WHEN they recover, I will own a lot more Alphabet than I would have without the drop.

Crypto I think is out of the question due to uncertainty atm. The way I see it, I have 3 options:

Futures: 
Pros: Trades 24/5, if good could make a few hundred in a week without playing with alot of contracts
Cons: Losses can get big real fast (I used to play oil/gold), and the market slows down when I would trade after work, much less volatility (I'm EST)

Forex: Basically same as Futures except I'd have to go through another broker besides TD, also I've found forex to be less prone to dramatic turns like oil/gold

Swing: Pros: Can leverage more of my capital, can put TA/DD to good use here Cons: Market not the best right now, would require doing some DD at work before market close, and I don't always have time.

Any suggestions?

For example when there's a gap up at the beginning of the trading day, you can see the price movement during after hours trading and then once 9:30 hits bam a gap in the chart. Now I know the explanation for this is that many buyers are purchasing the stock in a short amount of time (right when the market opens) which causes the gap up but let's say the stock moves from 10 to 15 right around 9:30, is there really no transition that can be recorded on a chart from 10 to 15, is every buyer just purchasing the stock at 10 one second and the next they're like ""oh it's 15 now alright"" and what determines where the gap stops if there's no transition. Would this transition be shown with something like 5 second candle sticks? If everyone is trying to buy at 10 then how can the price even gap up if nobody can react to that quick of a movement? Is everyone in this situation buying with market orders and then getting burned when their order gets filled above what they thought they were purchasing at?

bobjohnson135;1518644761;7xlm0b;;7;;2;"Hey all, 

I’m 14, freshman in high school and living in the US.  So recently over our Christmas break I was bruising YouTube and somehow a video popped up about how Apple stock was doing well. From there, I kind of just went on clicking the next recommended video and I think this process went on until 1 or 2 am. I was still pretty clueless, all I knew was that a stock was part ownership of a corporation. 
Since then, I have done some reading and furthered out the basics of how trading works and how buying and selling makes you money. This topic just really interested me and I want to learn more. 
So, since I obviously can’t invest real money as a minor (my parents don’t trust me with their money), I got this app called MarketSim on IOS. You start with $10,000 and just try to make your way up. Be made about $100 but that’s it.  
I guess I don’t really have a point here, but my question is what are the types of traders and the most successful/common strategies (long or short term)? Also, what are some good companies that look like they have a good future and how do you identify them? At this point, I’m just trying to learn more about the market and how it works. How do I identify what stocks to buy? I’m guessing blue chip for long term, but what about short? Like predicting the trend that a given stock will follow?

I'm typically active on r/sysadmin because of my career, but I have recently taken a strong interest in investing in stocks, and I don't know how best to begin. I could fumble around and just try to teach myself like I do with most things, but for investing, putting $$ on the line, I think it is wiser to come here and ask for advice first. 

Is there a book that would be good to read to get a grounding? 

What is the best means of buying and selling stocks? 

How do I learn about what to invest in next? 

I have so many questions!

ghostofgbt;1518823800;7y2vke;;4;;19;"Hey everyone!

As promised **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/7wrknx/new_weekly_stock_analysis_and_contest/)**, this week I'm starting a free educational series on analyzing stocks using **[LazyFA](https://www.lazyfa.com)**!

--------------------------
**This week we're looking at Fossil Group, Inc. (FOSL), and this ticker will be free for all, with sitewide access until 2/23/2018!**
--------------------------

--------------------------
I thought FOSL was an interesting case for this week since they recently released earnings which sent the stock soaring over 70%! However, this is a troubled company that has seen declining sales for the last few years, which is obvious when you look at the share price which at one point had declined nearly 90% since 2015. Even with this most recent increase, the stock is still down over 60% from a couple of years ago.

*Now the question is: is this the beginning of a turnaround story, or an opportunity to join the massive short interest that already exists in this company's stock?*

The rules for the contest are super simple!

--------------------------
**CONTEST RULES:**
--------------------------
--------------------------

1. **[Create a free account here](https://www.lazyfa.com/accounts/register/)**

2. Conduct your own analysis using LazyFA and whatever other tools you want

3. Post your analysis in the comments by **8PM ET on Sunday, 2/18/18** *along with your LazyFA username*

4. I'll pick the best, most thorough or most interesting analysis

5. Winner gets a free month of access to the whole site! 

6. You can win once every 3 months.

--------------------------
**REMEMBER:**
--------------------------
--------------------------

This is *fundamental* analysis! We want to dig into the guts of the company, their management, their strategies, and their finances. I always consider technicals like the chart too, but for the purposes of this series I'd like to focus mostly on fundamentals.

I did a quick analysis myself to get everyone started:

As a quick disclaimer, please remember I'm not an investment advisor. The purpose of this is just to work together to conduct a thorough analysis of a new company each week! Make sure you have done your own research before you make any investment decisions.

Alright that's it...let me know if you have any questions and have fun!

What has been surprising, however, is how orderly the trade has been considering what market participants went through over the previous week. Can we expect much of the same this week or is this potentially the calm before the storm?

Floogieltradingco;1519301404;7zefse;;8;;4;"3 Steps To Profitable Stock Picking // DOWNLOAD MY FREE WALL STREET GUIDE here: https://tradingpart-time.com

Stock picking is a very complicated process and investors have different approaches. However, it is wise to follow general steps to minimize the risk of the investments. This article will outline these basic steps for picking high performance stocks. 


Step 1. Decide on the time frame and the general strategy of the investment. This step is very important because it will dictate the type of stocks you buy. 


Suppose you decide to be a long term investor, you would want to find stocks that have sustainable competitive advantages along with stable growth. The key for finding these stocks is by looking at the historical performance of each stock over the past decades and do a simple business S.W.O.T. (Strength-weakness-opportunity-threat) analysis on the company. 


If you decide to be a short term investor, you would like to adhere to one of the following strategies: 


a. Momentum Trading. This strategy is to look for stocks that increase in both price and volume over the recent past. Most technical analyses support this trading strategy. My advice on this strategy is to look for stocks that have demonstrated stable and smooth rises in their prices. The idea is that when the stocks are not volatile, you can simply ride the up-trend until the trend breaks. 


b. Contrarian Strategy. This strategy is to look for over-reactions in the stock market. Researches show that stock market is not always efficient, which means prices do not always accurately represent the values of the stocks. When a company announces a bad news, people panic and price often drops below the stock's fair value. To decide whether a stock over-reacted to a news, you should look at the possibility of recovery from the impact of the bad news. For example, if the stock drops 20% after the company loses a legal case that has no permanent damage to the business's brand and product, you can be confident that the market over-reacted. My advice on this strategy is to find a list of stocks that have recent drops in prices, analyze the potential for a reversal (through candlestick analysis). If the stocks demonstrate candlestick reversal patterns, I will go through the recent news to analyze the causes of the recent price drops to determine the existence of over-sold opportunities. 


Step 2. Conduct researches that give you a selection of stocks that is consistent to your investment time frame and strategy. There are numerous stock screeners on the web that can help you find stocks according to your needs. 


Step 3. Once you have a list of stocks to buy, you would need to diversify them in a way that gives the greatest reward/risk ratio. One way to do this is conduct a Markowitz analysis for your portfolio. The analysis will give you the proportions of money you should allocate to each stock. This step is crucial because diversification is one of the free-lunches in the investment world. 


These three steps should get you started in your quest to consistently make money in the stock market. They will deepen your knowledge about the financial markets, and would provide a sense of confidence that helps you to make better trading decisions.";;3 Steps To Profitable Stock Picking;

Randomshortdude;1519427244;7zscyn;;5;;1;"Hey all,

I’m an avid stock market follower but for some reason this basic answer is stumping me.

Suppose Johnny wants to buy Stock A, but Stock A costs like $540. Johnny only has $2160 and wants to get way more than just 4 shares.

What’s the name of the derivative that is basically a contract pegged to that stock that’s 1% of it’s total value? Like instead of $540, he can pay $5.40 and if it goes to $580, his shares would be worth $5.80 each and he could sell for $0.40/per. 

If there isn’t a derivative like that already in existence, why not? Regulatory issues? Lack of interest? Logistical problems?

I figured with all the options and derivatives we have these days, this would be a rather popular option to offer.

I guess one would need to make it an ETP, then let it trade like a futures contract, right? Or possibly a market maker could simply “fund” the creation of such an option and once enough players entered the given market for that contract, it would buy/sell on its own right? 

I figured this would be most akin to an ETP, but it seems like ETPs are pegged exclusively to a fund of some sort or in the rare nuanced cases, some measure of an index (S&amp;P500) like the VIX.

Could I create the “StockAoption” and “InverseStockAOption” for this? 

Just spitballing here. Any and all responses/feedback would be appreciated. ";;Fundamental Stock Question;

I was thinking of posting in investing related subreddits, but the audience there seems to be more experienced investors who aren't our target audience. 

Just looking for pointers on which sub Reddits to focus in on. 

By the way, here was the article I was thinking of sharing:

The GBH Insights analyst raised the price target for the e-commerce giant to $1,850 from $1,500.

""The Prime membership moat that [CEO Jeff] Bezos &amp; Co. have built is gaining further steam in the field, and the Amazon 'flywheel effect' is further playing out globally among consumers,"" Ives said in a note.


""The Bezos strategic path, both on the consumer and enterprise fronts, are still in the middle innings of playing out and Amazon remains a 'green light' name to own at these levels,"" he said.

Amazon's ""1-2 punch"" of consumer retail growth and Amazon Web Services — combined with Whole Foods tailwinds and a push into healthcare — could push the company past the milestone, Ives said.

ghostofgbt;1519691124;80i0i0;;13;;1;"I thought this was pretty interesting...since 2006, Jeff Bezos has been systematically selling Amazon common stock into the open market. It seems to be mostly in accordance with his 10b5-1 trading plan, as I can see by looking at a random sample of the massive amount of form 4's filed since 2006, but to me it was interesting nonetheless.

Here is a chart of Amazon's [TTM revenue since 2005](https://i.imgur.com/xs1luZQ.png), and his [common stock holdings over a similar period](https://i.imgur.com/t9T3lbL.png).

In contrast, Senior Vice President Jeff Blackburn has been systematically exercising his [options to buy](https://i.imgur.com/2ysxg7k.png) and converting [restricted stock units](https://i.imgur.com/2689rx3.png) into [common stock](https://i.imgur.com/W7qRA26.png), increasing his holdings five-fold over a similar period. 

Keep in mind that AMZN stock has risen meteorically since 2006, so the overall holdings in monetary value of Bezos and Blackburn have increased dramatically, but still ... any thoughts on what this might mean, if anything? Could it signify that Blackburn has more faith in the future of the company than Bezos himself?

Just-Touch-It;1519700452;80j265;;14;;8;"Good evening everyone, the time has come where I am now wondering if you guys would mind providing me some opinions, insight, and critique of my portfolio. I’ve been investing for nearly 3 years now but the last year I’ve been seriously going at it, researching as much as I can and contributing roughly 25% of my income towards retirement planning. Here’s my portfolio broken down by holding and percentages (rounded to nearest 1/2 % point) for reference:

Vanguard Healthcare Fund (VGHCX) - 15%
Vanguard Small Cap Fund (VSTCX) - 7%
Vanguard US Growth Fund (VWUSX) - 11%
Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) - 5%
Vanguard Industrials ETF (VIS) - 8.5%
Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC) - 2.5%
Vanguard Info Tech ETF (VGT) - 2.5%
Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) - 3.5%
Global X Robotics (BOTZ) - 2.5%
Vanguard Target Retirement Fund - 12.5%
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) - 7%
Apple (AAPL) - 3.5%
Store Capital (STOR)- 4%
Waste Management (WM) - 2%
UPS (UPS) - 2%
McDonalds (MCD) - 2%
Shopify (SHOP) - 3.5%
Visa (V) - 4%
Omeros Corp (OMER) - 1%
22nd Century (XXII) - 1%

I try to diversify myself with several sector ETFs. The reason for simply not going with something like VTI is because there are some sectors I’d rather avoid right now as I’m young, holding long term, and won’t be touching this money for quite awhile so I’m more open for risk. This has resulted me being  fairly heavy in tech, healthcare, and industrial with virtually nothing in basic materials, utilities, or telecommunications.

In addition to the ETFs and healthcare fund, I choose two other mutual funds that provide some balance/diversity yet are still aggressive. As you can see bonds make up very little of my holdings (roughly 1.5% only due to my target fund). I also hold roughly a handful of companies that I feel are solid, wall ran, and capable of modest yet solid growth. My last two holdings shown here are my risky stocks which I consider no more than gambles thus making up less than 3% of my portfolio. Both have been losses thus far for what it’s worth, although I haven’t sold anything yet with them.

My plan is basically keep on trucking along with a similar path. The only additions I hope to make before year end are Microsoft, Amazon, and possibly something international related as foreign stocks/companies only make up 12% of my portfolio right now. Besides that I’ll do some minor ETF buying to balance and keep most of my contributions to my US Growth and Target Funds which have been killing it the past 1.5 years.

So what do you all think? Am I decent for someone planning to hold most of these holdings 5, 10, 20 years out? Too many companies or too diverse? Not diverse enough? Genius or stupidity? Let’s hear it, folks. Thanks everyone!";;My Portfolio;

rstumbaugh;1519738722;80mh8i;;13;;25;Fed initially predicted 3 rate hikes and mentioned they'd be open to adding more as necessary. It sounds like many think 4 rate hikes is likely: huge tax cuts as well as a seemingly unstoppable bull market that's already back to near where it was before the correction will likely lead to more inflation, correct?. Shouldn't the market be reacting negatively to the possibility of 4 rate hikes or are we just enjoying a nice run-up before the announcement?;;Fed announcement today?;

Spotify has filed to go public
Posted 3 hours ago by Katie Roof (@Katie_Roof), Josh Constine (@joshconstine)

Music streaming service Spotify is going public and it just unveiled its filing.

The documents state that it is targeting a $1 billion IPO, but the company actually plans to go public without the standard fundraising event. Spotify isn’t selling its shares to the public. Instead, the event known as a “direct listing” will be a series of transactions from existing shareholders (like employees and investors) selling shares to stock market investors. Spotify’s filing even acknowledges that selling shares this way is “risky.”

Its public debut is likely to happen in late March or early April, but it is unclear how much shares will cost when it lists under “SPOT” on the New York Stock Exchange. Spotify says that for 2018 its shares have traded on the private markets for between $90 and $132.50, but that these transactions “may have little or no relation to the opening public price of our ordinary shares on the NYSE.”

Spotify says it is present in 61 countries and its platform includes 159 million monthly active users and 71 million premium subscribers.

The filing shows that the Swedish company had 4.09 billion Euros in revenue last year (or close to $5 billion), compared to 2.95 billion Euros (about $3.6 billion) the year before. 2015 saw 1.94 billion Euros in revenue (about $2.37 billion).

Losses for last year were 1.2 billion Euros ($1.46 billion), which compares to 539 million Euros ($657 million) the year before.

Spotify previously raised about $2.7 billion in both debt and equity. Accel, Kleiner Perkins and Founders Fund are amongst the Valley VCs that invested. Goldman Sachs and Fidelity also own part of Spotify.

The filing shows that CEO and co-founder Daniel Ek owns 23.8% of the company. Martin Lorentzon, who co-founded the business, owns 12.4%.

The filing has an additional note about Ek’s compensation, which says that he doesn’t receive a base salary, but is eligible for $1 million annual bonuses based on metrics like subscriber growth and active users.

There are some key obstacles to the business, which Spotify acknowledges in its risk factors.

In it, Spotify explains how it will have to stay ahead of competitors and satisfy rights holders. The first risk mentioned is that  “some of our competitors, including Apple, Amazon, and Google, have developed, and are continuing to develop, devices for which their music streaming service is preloaded.” Since Spotify currently doesn’t make its own phones or smart speakers, its competitors have an easy way to grow their subscriber counts that it doesn’t. This could encourage Spotify to build its own smart speaker or headphone hardware in the future.

Some are concerned that Spotify is beholden to music rights owners like record labels who could try to jack up their rates during periodic re-negotiations if they think the service becomes too profitable. There are also administrative agencies like the Copyright Royalty Board and trade groups like the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers who could seek to increase the rates Spotify has to pay. Control of rights is heavily concentrated within a few major labels and organizations. Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and Merlin hold rights for music that accounted for 87% of Spotify’s streams in 2017. They could potentially wreck Spotify’s margins by demanding higher rates or deprive it of content in ways that would drive away listeners.

Spotify’s costs could continue to increase as it pays for content, creates its own, researches and builds new features, and markets the service in the face of competition. Spotify’s licensing and royalty agreements are complex and could lead to litigation costs if it doesn’t hit milestones or guaranteed minimum payouts, or doesn’t properly license all the content it streams. Spotify has already been hit with numerous lawsuits for failing to find and pay all rights holders. Its competitors also hold larger patent portfolios that they could use to attack Spotify for intellectual property infringement. 

Spotify faces competition from all sides and formats. There are traditional formats like CDs and Vinyl, digital files like MP3s and iTunes downloads, terrestrial and satellite radio, online radio like Pandora, and competing on-demand subscription services including Amazon Prime, Apple Music, Deezer, Google Play Music / YouTube, Joox, and SoundCloud. Since Google and Apple own the top mobile app stores, they could bury Spotify and already charge it a tax that doesn’t get applied to their music services. Interestingly, Spotify lists Facebook as a potential competitor, given that it’s building a smart speaker and has struck deals with record labels though it offers no music streaming service currently.

Spotify writes that  “a key differentiating factor between Spotify and other music content providers is our ability to predict music that our Users will enjoy.” Features like Discover Weekly are what keep hardcore listeners on its service, and it will have to find a way to stay ahead of the recommendation engines of its competitors if it wants to win.

snack-fu-bling;1519863258;8110hd;;4;;2;"I will start by saying Long Live Capitalism!

We have come a long way from the days where the largest publicly traded company no matter where in the world it shares are exchange and traded were worth $5 Billion. According to numerous research I done the first Trillion dollar company was not headquartered in the US and sources said Saudi Arabia's Aramco -yet to go public- is worth $1 Trillion. I also saw on Wikipedia that China's PetroChina was a Trillion dollar company years ago but here is the catch both Aramco and PetroChina are state-owned or may I say socialist and not I dependent or pure capitalist. And that brings me to the main points here. As of February 28th 2018 the three largest publicly traded [capitalist entities] are Apple with a market capitalization of $905 Billion, Alphabet owner of Google with a market capitalization of $780 Billion, and Amazon with a market capitalization of $732 Billion. All three are bigger than the next 500 companies in the S&amp;P or the 100 companies in the FTSE. All three will definitely cross $1 Trillion in the near future at various stages with Apple seeing as the first one then Amazon likely becoming the second one and Alphabet the third one. Now that will greatly change the outlook and landscape of capitalism either as a small company or a big one regardless of being private or publicly traded. I have read comments saying that it will be worrying and I respond to one of them saying ""Business still goes on, Companies can stay private and do great [Mars have been a private company for 100+ years] and the ones wishing to go public must have great business models and great financials plus a sense of inclusiveness for all shareholders [Snap was the first company to go public with a three class structure with 95% voting with the founders and no voting to outside shareholders- and the company have a bad financials coupled with missteps]"" so the 3-As [Apple, Alphabet, Amazon] is kind of doing good to the stock market and capitalism as a whole. And all three companies are endowed in terms of revenue, cash flow etc. So in conclusion, Capitalism gets more stronger even with worries and Whatnots [some people  saying Amazon should be broken into 20 companies then again why? If it because of market cap growth then that stupid]. I am for an excellent capitalism and a fair globalization. Now I will end by saying, Long Live Capitalism!";;Apple, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon becoming Trillion dollar companies will change the Stock market landscape.;

Studios, and Turner Networks. Here are the content/media assets current owned -fully or partially- by AT&amp;T:


* AT&amp;T Sport Nets [regional sport networks] with 13 million subscribers in 22 states

* 40% stake in another rsn- Root Sports Northwest with 60% owned by Seattle League club

* 42% of GSN (Game Show Network) with the remaining 58% owned by Sony Pictures [so a potential target and natural one if Time Warner deal does not happen]

* 50% of Otter Media which owns Crunchyroll, VRV, Fullscreen (which owns Rooster Teeth), Gunpowder and Sky, Dust, and Hello Sunshine (with Reese Witherspoon) other 50% owned by Peter Chernin's Chernin Group [AT&amp;T reportedly going to buyout the remaining stake for $1 Billion]

* Audience Network (AT&amp;T Audience or simply Audience) programming include Mr Mercedes, Kingdom among others

* AT&amp;T Originals TV studio (formerly DIRECTV Originals)

* AT&amp;T Hello Labs digital studio

* 2% of Lions Gate [another target if Time Warner deal fail] which owns a Film and TV studio- franchises include Twilight, Hunger Games, Mad Men, OITNB- and Starz a competitor to HBO, Epix, Showtime.

Targets in merger fails are: Sony Pictures, Lions Gate and even AMC, Discovery, and Viacom (I see a hostile acquisition- AT&amp;T buying a big stake like 20% in the open market even though the Redstones owns 80% of the votes with just 9% equity). AT&amp;T have about $50 Billion in cash with them (not off shore like the Big Techs)

* ""Spend a lot of time doing research on a stock before trading it.""
* ""You never know what the market is going to do -- it's really just a gamble.""

So my question is, why do all this research if trading stocks is just a gamble anyway? I get that some stocks are obviously way better than others, especially bluechip stocks, but even those can fluctuate wildly from day to day and week to week it seems.

To me, it seems that you can really only do so much research on a stock before it starts to become counterproductive. since the market is unpredictable anyway. Might as well throw a dart at a wall of stocks to pick one, then do your best to buy low and sell high.

Wakilahmad777;1520060428;81nykf;;3;;2;"Nowadays, many investors' portfolios include investments such as mutual funds, stocks and bonds. But the variety of securities you have at your disposal does not end there. Another type of security, known as options, presents a world of opportunity to sophisticated investors who understand both the practical uses and inherent risks associated with this asset class.

The power of options lies in their versatility, and their ability to interact with traditional assets such as individual stocks. They enable you to adapt or adjust your position according to many market situations that may arise. For example, options can be used as an effective hedge against a declining stock market to limit downside losses. Options can be put to use for speculative purposes or to be exceedingly conservative, as you want. Using options is therefore best described as part of a larger strategy of investing.

This functional versatility, however, does not come without its costs. Options are complex securities and can be extremely risky if used improperly. This is why, when trading options with a broker, you'll often come across a disclaimer like the following:http://www.stockmarketways.com/2018/03/options-basics-tutorial.html

However, as someone who is interested in taking a more active approach, it would be nice to have a place to talk specifically about strategy without getting into a debate about passive versus active or some variation thereof. 

I made a subreddit specifically for active management of portfolios and I'm hoping to have more conversation about specific strategies with whomever would like to do the same. If you're an indexer and just want to talk about strategy because you enjoy it, that's fine too. I only ask that any conversation about strategy does not devolve into active versus passive unless that is the topic of the thread. 

Mods, hopefully you do not see this as a competitive subreddit, and rather view it as a sub with a more narrow focus on active management.

snack-fu-bling;1520166289;81xdwx;;8;;9;"If you own a successful private company and you want to grow, you might be thinking about going public. It can be a great way to raise money, increase your company’s profile and feel like you’ve really made it. But it’s expensive and time consuming to become and remain publicly traded, and you lose some control of the business. Let’s take a closer look at these and other pros and cons of going public vs. staying private.

IPO Pros
The biggest motivation to conduct an initial public offering (IPO) is typically financial.

“Going public gets you cash – and usually lots of it,” says Eric Chen, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Saint Joseph in West Hartford, Conn., where he teaches finance, strategy and law classes. In his previous career in corporate finance and equity research, Chen says he led or participated in taking more than 25 companies public. “Where you might have been cash-constrained before, you’re now flush with capital that you’re supposed to invest in the company in order to make it grow exponentially,” he says. 

In addition, you can also use your company stock as currency. It’s worth something because people can buy and sell it on a public exchange. You can use it to acquire other companies to grow faster, to take out competitors or to strengthen your market position through synergy. 

There is also a certain perceived legitimacy in being public, Chen says. “People will know about you. Being public will make it easier for you to do business with others. Securing financing will also be easier,” he says, since the money companies raise from going public usually shores up the balance sheet. Potential investors and business partners may feel more comfortable working with you since your company information will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and available for all to see. 

In addition to increasing perceptions of your company’s legitimacy, “there is just a perceived cool factor about going public, ringing the bell, and trading on the stock market—it’s like a rite of passage,” says Jeremy S. Office, founder and principal of Maclendon Wealth Management and co-founder and managing partner of venture fund SJO Worldwide, both in in Delray Beach, Fla. 


Staying Private Pros
Going public may help you grow your balance sheet, smooth business transactions, make it easier to take over competitors and make you stand up a little straighter, but there are many pros to remaining private. You report to a finite group of investors, Office says,  and while your pool of potential investors is smaller, since they have to be accredited, “right now there is a record amount of capital going to early-stage companies.”  

Staying private means you can choose exactly who invests in your company, and it’s not as if you can’t decide to go public later. But as long as you remain private, you don't have to alter your company’s focus or strategy to meet Wall Street’s expectations, Office says

Going public is also a huge risk. “What if the IPO is a failure? The IPO flop can end your business,” Office says. A benefit of staying private is that you don’t subject your company to that risk. If you’re in a position where you’re so successful that going public is even a consideration, you might actually be better off leaving things as they are.

“If you’re not big enough, don’t even think about it,” Chen says. “The markets are littered with small companies who really didn’t have enough to sustain a public offering.” Depending on the industry you’re in, this can happen to companies that post several hundred million in annual sales, he says. You need to have a strong following so the company’s stock will trade properly. “Many of these situations end up as “penny stocks” and face delisting from the exchange,” he says. 

A major benefit of staying private, in other words, is that you limit your downside risk. You can keep doing what you’re doing to earn the profits that have made your business as strong as it already is. You don’t have to answer to thousands of outside stockholders or risk losing control of your company 


IPO Cons
While the prestige and the cash are tempting reasons to go public, the expensive and time-consuming process and requirements for holding an IPO and being publicly traded are significant drawbacks.

IPO Cons
While the prestige and the cash are tempting reasons to go public, the expensive and time-consuming process and requirements for holding an IPO and being publicly traded are significant drawbacks.


“Going public, even under the reduced reporting requirements of the JOBS Act, can be an expensive exercise,” says Helen Adams, San Diego area managing partner of Haskell &amp; White, one of the largest independently owned accounting, auditing and tax consulting firms in Southern California. “There are specific SEC financial statement filing requirements on a quarterly and annual basis, and many periodic legal reporting requirements, including those for material transactions and for stock trading by senior executives and board members,” she says.

Chen also adds that going public itself is an expensive process. “You have to pay for road shows, and your senior management is going to spend lots of time prepping for the offering instead of focusing on the business.” 

In short, you’re going to spend more money as a public company than a private one, Chen says. “If you’re the size of GE, you can afford the extra costs of being public,” he says. But if you’re small, you might find that your bottom line gets chewed up by costs you didn’t consider carefully. 

Another drawback is that while going public might be a boon to your company’s bottom line, it won’t necessarily line your own pockets because founders may not be able to sell their shares.

""Don’t expect to get your money out anytime soon,” Chen says. “Your shares are going to be subject to lock-up provisions for at least six months.” 

The reasons for this are largely based on investor psychology. “Think about a situation where Facebook is going public, and Mark Zuckerberg is selling his own shares into the offering,” Chen says. Investors will think, “What does he know that the public doesn’t? Is he looking to dump shares on bad news?” This doesn’t mean you won’t eventually be able to sell your holdings, but it does mean you will likely have to wait. 


Staying Private Cons
With a private company, you may not be able to attract top talent through benefits like stock incentives, says Mike Ser, an active trader, trading coach and entrepreneur with more than 16 years of trading experience. He is the co-founder, along with Andy Man, of Ser Man Traders, a training program for professional traders. Another con is that as a private company, you can’t use your stock as currency to acquire your competitors or other companies. “If you're a private company, it's more of a challenge as you either have to have cash or borrow debt to acquire companies,” he says. 

Staying private also limits liquidity for existing investors. They can’t easily sell their stake in the company by going to a public exchange. For a well-known, top-performing, venture-capital backed company, it might not be so hard to find a buyer, but in the case of a lesser-known company, the only potential buyers might be other existing owners. Selling shares in the secondary market is often challenging, especially since prospective buyers have to be accredited investors.

You may still have investors to answer to as a private company, just not as many as with a public company. The investors you do have might hold a significant stake in your company and be vocal about how they think you should run the business. You might not have as much control as you’d like, even if your company remains private. At the same time, relying on private investors may not allow you to raise the funding you need, and you may not be able to find enough private investors who are interested in your company.

In addition to increasing perceptions of your company’s legitimacy, “there is just a perceived cool factor about going public, ringing the bell, and trading on the stock market—it’s like a rite of passage,” says Jeremy S. Office, founder and principal of Maclendon Wealth Management and co-founder and managing partner of venture fund SJO Worldwide, both in in Delray Beach, Fla. 


Staying Private Pros
Going public may help you grow your balance sheet, smooth business transactions, make it easier to take over competitors and make you stand up a little straighter, but there are many pros to remaining private. You report to a finite group of investors, Office says,  and while your pool of potential investors is smaller, since they have to be accredited, “right now there is a record amount of capital going to early-stage companies.”  (See also: The Rise of Corporate Venture Capital.)

Staying private means you can choose exactly who invests in your company, and it’s not as if you can’t decide to go public later. But as long as you remain private, you don't have to alter your company’s focus or strategy to meet Wall Street’s expectations, Office says (See also: Keeping Control of Your Business after the IPO).

Going public is also a huge risk. “What if the IPO is a failure? The IPO flop can end your business,” Office says. A benefit of staying private is that you don’t subject your company to that risk. If you’re in a position where you’re so successful that going public is even a consideration, you might actually be better off leaving things as they are. (See also: IPO Flippers And The Companies Who Hate Them.)

“If you’re not big enough, don’t even think about it,” Chen says. “The markets are littered with small companies who really didn’t have enough to sustain a public offering.” Depending on the industry you’re in, this can happen to companies that post several hundred million in annual sales, he says. You need to have a strong following so the company’s stock will trade properly. “Many of these situations end up as “penny stocks” and face delisting from the exchange,” he says. 

A major benefit of staying private, in other words, is that you limit your downside risk. You can keep doing what you’re doing to earn the profits that have made your business as strong as it already is. You don’t have to answer to thousands of outside stockholders or risk losing control of your company 

IPO Cons
While the prestige and the cash are tempting reasons to go public, the expensive and time-consuming process and requirements for holding an IPO and being publicly traded are significant drawbacks.


“Going public, even under the reduced reporting requirements of the JOBS Act, can be an expensive exercise,” says Helen Adams, San Diego area managing partner of Haskell &amp; White, one of the largest independently owned accounting, auditing and tax consulting firms in Southern California. “There are specific SEC financial statement filing requirements on a quarterly and annual basis, and many periodic legal reporting requirements, including those for material transactions and for stock trading by senior executives and board members,” she says.

Chen also adds that going public itself is an expensive process. “You have to pay for road shows, and your senior management is going to spend lots of time prepping for the offering instead of focusing on the business.” 

In short, you’re going to spend more money as a public company than a private one, Chen says. “If you’re the size of GE, you can afford the extra costs of being public,” he says. But if you’re small, you might find that your bottom line gets chewed up by costs you didn’t consider carefully. 

Another drawback is that while going public might be a boon to your company’s bottom line, it won’t necessarily line your own pockets because founders may not be able to sell their shares.

""Don’t expect to get your money out anytime soon,” Chen says. “Your shares are going to be subject to lock-up provisions for at least six months.”  (See also: What is an IPO lock-up period and how long is it?)

The reasons for this are largely based on investor psychology. “Think about a situation where Facebook is going public, and Mark Zuckerberg is selling his own shares into the offering,” Chen says. Investors will think, “What does he know that the public doesn’t? Is he looking to dump shares on bad news?” This doesn’t mean you won’t eventually be able to sell your holdings, but it does mean you will likely have to wait. 


Staying Private Cons
With a private company, you may not be able to attract top talent through benefits like stock incentives, says Mike Ser, an active trader, trading coach and entrepreneur with more than 16 years of trading experience. He is the co-founder, along with Andy Man, of Ser Man Traders, a training program for professional traders. Another con is that as a private company, you can’t use your stock as currency to acquire your competitors or other companies. “If you're a private company, it's more of a challenge as you either have to have cash or borrow debt to acquire companies,” he says. 

Staying private also limits liquidity for existing investors. They can’t easily sell their stake in the company by going to a public exchange. For a well-known, top-performing, venture-capital backed company, it might not be so hard to find a buyer, but in the case of a lesser-known company, the only potential buyers might be other existing owners. Selling shares in the secondary market is often challenging, especially since prospective buyers have to be accredited investors. (See also: How can I sell private company stock?)

You may still have investors to answer to as a private company, just not as many as with a public company. The investors you do have might hold a significant stake in your company and be vocal about how they think you should run the business. You might not have as much control as you’d like, even if your company remains private. At the same time, relying on private investors may not allow you to raise the funding you need, and you may not be able to find enough private investors who are interested in your company.

The Bottom Line
Going public isn’t always the best choice for your business. It will no doubt be fun to brag about it to everyone you know, but it might not be as lucrative as you think, given the costs of the IPO itself and the increased financial reporting requirements. You’ll lose some control over the company to shareholders who want a say in the business and to the ongoing need to keep both your company’s performance and the public’s perception high so the stock price doesn’t tank.

QuantalyticsResearch;1520274597;8283lw;;1;;3;"Over the last 12-months, investors who chose to focus their portfolio allocations on US equity markets have been proven to be smart. On a trailing 12-month basis, the Russell 2000 is up 10.0%, the S&amp;P 500 is up 14.57%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 26.29%. In any time period, these returns would be very good and they especially look compelling given the backdrop of political uncertainty, expensive valuations and a hawkish Federal Reserve last year. However, while these returns are very attractive, it is tough to ignore the returns of international equity markets, in particular aggregate Emerging Markets &amp; China. At what point do investors start to appreciate the benefits from adding international exposure to their portfolios for not only diversification, but also for enhancing portfolio returns?

YTD, the Nasdaq Composite is up 6.57%, the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.01%, while the Russell 2000 is down .07%.  In comparison, YTD, Chinese Large-Cap Equities (FXI) is up 2.36%, and has returned 25.37% on a trailing 12 month basis. Additionally, YTD, MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) is up 2.14% coupled with a 27.24% trailing 12-month return. Outside of the Nasdaq’s strong performance, which is not a truly diversified investment vehicle since it is comprised of US tech stocks, investors would have fared very well if they had allocated internationally in developing China or broad Emerging Markets. Valuations appear attractively priced for China and EM –  with a 12x Fwd 12M P/E ratio for EM &amp; China. Earnings growth is north of 30% for both groups – in comparison to earnings growth being similar for US Indices despite having Fwd 12M P/E’s at 17x. The market appears to be over-discounting growth in aggregate EM &amp; China. As a result, going forward investors may want to reconsider adding international exposure to their portfolios.

omarm1984;1520275126;82869j;;3;;15;"Given the volatility in the last few weeks I have a big suspicion there is some collusion going on between top institutions and the highest government officials. For example:

* The big sell-off in the 1st week of February came a week ahead of Trump's statements on trade and tariffs. In fact, it was reported [Carl Icahn dumped millions in shares of steel companies before trump's announcement](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/icahn-unloads-steel-stocks_us_5a9c9a47e4b089ec353b9dc1). Many have said this decline was triggered by expectation of a hawkish 2018, but that was the expectation for months already, so it's quite hard to believe investors suddenly ""woke up"".

* Today, stocks were poised to continue their decline in light of Trump's trade war comments, however the market suddenly started raising, and quite powerfully. Then, at noon, we see headlines of Paul Ryan's split with Trump over tariffs.

Is this all coincidence or are high government figures feeding information to big investors?
";;Insider trading ahead of government headlines?;
BR-Technicals;1520275295;828710;;3;;0;"Key Points
While many investors are focused on strong economic fundamentals, supply and demand dictate the market, not the economy.
2017 was a historical year, but it has likely sucked up the amount of money available to buy stocks.
Current economic conditions mean that more wealth is not likely to enter the stock market.
Structural demand is also weakening as the Federal Reserve is tightening monetary conditions. 

A Rough Beginning to 2018

The recent volatility in markets has brought a lot of rhetoric from professional investors. Most are saying this volatility is healthy, and that strong fundamentals will prevail. However, while economic fundamentals still point to a healthy economy, the stock market still needs cash to increase stock prices. The forces of supply and demand dictate the market, not the economy.

In 2018, demand for US stocks will be low. High investor sentiment in 2017 likely pulled all of the money from the sidelines, as the market had a historical year. Future economic growth is not likely to bring more cash to the markets, and structural demand for stocks is weakening.

2017 - Awakening the Animal Spirits

When Donald Trump won the presidential election, investor sentiment rose fast. He had promised tax reform, healthcare reform, and infrastructure spending on the campaign trail. All three could bolster the economy and the markets.  Also, the expectation that he would get things done shot equities higher.

The election also boosted consumer confidence by awakening the ""animal spirits"". People believed in the economy again, and consumer spending increased. This set investor expectations higher, and demand for stocks continued to rise.

As the year went on, economic data showed what all investors were hoping for: accelerating growth, low inflation, and rising consumer confidence followed by higher consumer spending. Plus, all investors kept the possibility of tax cuts in the back of their minds, and when it finally came, it spurred the markets even more.

With this perfect storm of economic data, everyone who was going to buy stocks, bought them. Expectations in 2017 were so great, and so high, that the market ""melted-up"" to produce an S&amp;P 500 return of more than 20%, with historically low volatility. This occurred in the eighth year of the bull-run. People were buying stocks because of ""the fear of missing out"", meaning they were buying stocks because they did not want to miss out on the opportunity to grow their portfolio.

Economic Conditions Limit Stock Market Demand

In the beginning of an economic cycle, unemployment usually begins to decline, and that increases the amount of wealth within the system. As wealth grows, more money is saved, and some of that moves into the equity markets, thus raising prices.

Right now, we are at the later end of the economic cycle, and there will not be an influx of wealth to push stocks higher. The economy is fully employed, and has been for sometime. Market demand for stocks is going to remain low because people have already entered the market with their savings.

Tightening Monetary Policy

Since the Great Recession, the markets have had very accommodative monetary policy. At the time, the Federal Reserve's solution to help the economy was to boost investment spending. They did this by lowering interest rates to historically low levels.

Then, the Fed started to buy bonds in the open market. These purchases provided two tools. First, it kept interest rates low by creating artificial demand for bonds. Second, it added more money into the system, raising the money supply. Both of these actions were designed to raise the amount of investment in the economy, by making money easy and cheap.

Consequences of Easy Money

Since the bottom in 2009, the S&amp;P 500 has risen by over 325%. The 10-year treasury fell to its lowest yield ever; in 2016, it reached a low of 1.367%. The unintended consequences of super easy monetary policy was that companies were buying back stock and raising dividends rather than focusing on research and development and other investments for their future. These buybacks continued to raise demand for stocks, and with bonds being so weak, stocks were a better alternative.

Now, as the US economy is growing stronger, the Fed is working to reverse their easy monetary policy and normalize it. This means interest rates are rising, and their bond purchases are stopping. Money supply is being taken out of the market, and financial conditions are tightening. The structural demand for stocks that was created after the financial crisis is now going away.

Conclusion

Demand for stocks is low. Tightening financial conditions mean that demand that was once there, is being taken out. Current economic conditions tell us that the growth in economic activity is not going to add a dramatic amount of wealth into the markets. Finally, extremely high investor sentiment in 2017 means that there isn’t much money left on the sidelines to be deployed. These three factors tell me that the stock market has likely reached a peak.

However, a lack of demand does not mean there is an abundance of supply. Since the fundamentals are so good, investors do not want to pull money out of the market. Also, the promise of repatriated funds going back to investors is likely a strong reason to hold stocks, for now.

The End of the Beta Trade?

From here, it is likely to become a stock picker's market. What we will see is that the indices like the S&amp;P 500 will stay flat or range bound. Companies that continue to surprise and perform well will be rewarded with higher prices. While stocks with weak earnings and outlooks will be punished. Cash will be rotated out of the bad performers, and into the good ones until there is finally a recession. The Beta trade is likely over, for now.

Asian markets closed up across the board with declining concerns about a global trade war and speculation that North Korea is willing to give up its nuclear program. The Nikkei and Topix were up 1.79% and 1.27% respectively with energy, tech and utilities stocks outperforming. While all sectors were up, telecom, financials and real estate were the largest underperformers. Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated that the 2% inflation target is a top priority for the Bank of Japan. This may allay investor concerns about a deceleration in the quantitative easing policy pursued by the BOJ.

Hong Kong and Chinese markets closed up with the Hang Seng +2.09%, Hang Seng China Enterprise Index +2.67% and the CSI 300 +1.12%. All sectors were positive with tech, energy and financials stocks the largest outperformers while consumer staples, financials and real estate stocks were the biggest laggards.

In the Land Down Under, Aussie stocks were up in sympathy with Chinese and Japanese equities. The ASX finished +1.14% with telecom, utilities and energy stocks the largest outperformers. Consumer staples, financials and real estate stocks with the biggest underperformers. Retail sales for January were below consensus at 0.1% m/m vs. consensus 0.4%. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decided to leave its policy rate unchanged.

European Equities Recap

European equities are up across the board with the Euro Stoxx 600 +0.57%. Regional indices are also positive with the FTSE 100 +1.14%, DAX +1.00% and the CAC 40 +0.71%. Autos &amp; Parts, materials and insurance stocks are the largest outperformers with real estate, media and food &amp; beverage stocks the biggest underperformers. Germany February PMI was reported to be 52.7 vs. 59.8 for January. Germany Retail PMI for February was reported as 53.8 vs. 53.0 for January. Italian equities are rebounding this morning following yesterday’s sell-off after the mixed results from Italian parliamentary elections. If today’s rally holds, Italian equities will close above last Friday’s close.

Rates &amp; Commodities Recap

US government bond yields are rallying with the yield on the 10-year back to 2.90%. 2-year fixed swaps rates are now imply a rate of 2.53%. The US Dollar index is down 0.44% with weakness against most major G7 currencies. In spite of the mixed Italian parliamentary elections, the EUR€ is up 0.73% this week. The strength in AUD$ is surprising given the the RBA’s decision to hold rates unchanged. While interest rate differentials favor the USD$, the AUD$ appears to be trading on speculation about capital flows. As a result, given Aussie exposure to capital flows related to industrial and base metals, we would expect the AUD$ to trade on speculation about potential for more tariffs. While the USD$ is weak in aggregate this AM, commodity prices are up across the board. WTI is now currently well above USD$63/barrel. We continue to reiterate our play on US E&amp;Ps:

SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETF (XOP) Bull Call Spread

Precious metals are up across the board, even in the face of a weaker JPY¥. Does this suggest that investors are hedging the recent bounce back from concerns about a global trade war? We continue to favor our two Gold-related options trades as hedges for long-only portfolios:

VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Bull Call Spread

SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) Bull Call Spread

Cryptocurrencies Recap

Major cryptocurrencies are down across the board. Ripple is now down over 11% after trading up yesterday on speculation that Coinbase is posed to add the cryptocurrency to its suite of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase has denied this is under consideration. Two of Japan’s major cryptocurrency organizations will merge and form a self-regulating body: Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA) and Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) will be merging in the wake of deepening discussions about stronger regulations. Zhang Ye, head of the technology unit at China’s Securities Regulatory Commission suggests Blockchain technology will need centralization. While he believes in the potential of blockchain, he suggests it needs to rely on a centralized infrastructure.

US Markets Pre-Market Preview &amp; Recap

US equities are pointing to a positive open in NY again. The VIX is currently trading below 18.0. Implied volatility continues to mean-revert downwards for S&amp;P 500, Russell 2000 and Nasdaq index options. However, while overall implied volatility is coming down, Skew on S&amp;P 500, Russell 2000 and Nasdaq options remains rich. This “implies” investors are buying puts, but not at the same rate as they were last week.

US equity markets rallied again yesterday, with the S&amp;P 500 +1.10%, Russell 2000 +0.84%, and the Nasdaq +1.00%. All sectors of the S&amp;P 500 were higher, with Utilities, Financials, and Real Estate the biggest outperformers, while Healthcare, Tech, and Consumer Staples were the biggest underperformers. Market breadth was positive for the second day in a row with advances outpacing declines; the put-call ratio supports this sentiment as calling buying outpaced put buying on the S&amp;P500.

XL Group Ltd (XL), CF Industries Holdings (CF), and Everest Re Group (RE) were the biggest gainers in the S&amp;P 500 yesterday, while Marriott International (MAR), JB Hunt Transport Services (JBHT), and Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) were the biggest laggards. Clearside Biomedical (CLSD) and Transcontinental Realty Investors (TCI) were two of the most notable gainers on the Russell 2000, while Dermira Inc. (DERM) and Sparton Corp. (SPA) were two notable laggards. Micron Technology (MU) and Incyte (INCY) were the biggest positive movers in the Nasdaq, while Marriott International (MAR) and JB Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) were the biggest negative movers.

jmscassidy;1520419100;82nd5u;;8;;0;"After having the money tied up elsewhere, I am thinking of bringing around $250K into the stock market.  I plan at this stage to put a big portion in bonds. I did keep one ETF from a previous investment VGK (Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF) - that I purchased in Mar of 2007 for $72.  The price now is around $59.  I see in spite of the market turn around, I have still not recovered my original investment, and it is still even farther away than its peak of $82 in Oct 2007.

Now let's look at a somewhat similar US equivalent.  Sure there might be differences, but I think the comparison is telling. The US iShares Russell 3000 ETF (IWV) was also at its peak of almost $90 in Oct 2007, but now it is at the crazy price of $161.6.  Everyone says that there is more value in foreign stock markets, but I rather doubt that my VGK ETF at $59 now will ever reach the $72 I paid for it, let alone reach its peak of $82.

Something is horribly out of whack with the US Stock market.  European markets are still around 20% of their peak 2007 levels, but the US market is miraculously trying to shoot for double its peak 2007 levels.  And, the Euro is at similar levels now as 2007, and the yield on this Europe VGK is only 2.7%.  It my opinion, it would be crazy now to consider putting money in US stocks as investment.  Crazy speculation seems more accurate.  If I had any money in stocks there, I would yank it now, or put a hard stop loss on everything.

crowcawer;1520526297;82yqgj;;20;;40;"The company showed a 19% earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter, and that matched analysts’ expectations. However, the 2018 profit outlook was lower than expected, driving down its stock.

Could this be artificial?


They saw sales up 2.7% from last year's shared quarter, and there is no strong indication of a shift this year. 

Kroger has a balanced approach to using the tax cuts, breaking it into thirds and disseminating it nearly equally between pushing the company forward into a high tech era by optimizing store space, and another third going to the employees--because we can't expect folks to work the store for free. The third...third, *ahem*-excuse me, is going to, ""helping share holders,"" or possibly dividend payouts. Sure this isn't extremely complicated, but that's the joy and beauty of the way $KR operates.

* * * 

Speculation time: 

Whatever they have extra from the $200M, after literally just moving things around in the stores, could be posted to lift them above their already arbitrarily set conservative 2018 earnings outlook.

That said, I could be wrong, and perhaps they just shilled together a plan for something to say during the earnings report.

To me it seems like they have a good model, and a safe outlook could potentially poise them to show out as opposed to flop. 
Like, they came to the fair on Tuesday to scope it out, but they will be back Friday, on bracelet night, and have a massively good time. 

Any other thoughts?

DTRS_Investing;1520809246;83qeb8;;0;;3;"Putting fears of rising interest rates and tariffs aside, it's time to re-visit the S&amp;P500 fair market value.  It's been 6 months since we last posted this topic.  Back on September 22, 2017 we posted Expected Value for the S&amp;P500 Index into 2018.  In that post we evaluated 5 long-term market trends (1932 to 2017) and 5 (post-recession) short-term market trends (2010 to 2017).  That analysis included 3 to 4 sources for earnings data and 2 sources for dividend data along with year-ahead projections for the S&amp;P 500 Index.  At that time we were projecting the S&amp;P500 Index to be at 2645 by March 31, 2018.  Currently the index sits at 2786.  In this post we will update the input data and projections for the remainder of 2018.  Specifically, we will compare expected market valuations based upon both short-term &amp; long-term trends for the following:

	Log (S&amp;P 500 Index Price) vs. Time - Charts 1 &amp; 2
	S&amp;P 500 Index Price vs. Earnings - Charts 3 &amp; 4
	S&amp;P 500 Index Price vs. Dividends - Chart 5 &amp; 6
	Log (S&amp;P 500 Index Price) vs. Log (Earnings) - Charts 7 &amp; 8
	Log (S&amp;P 500 Index Price) vs. Log (Dividends) - Charts 9 &amp; 10

First, let's summarize the 5 short-term formulas with their respective coefficients of determination:

(Expected Value)S&amp;P500 = 365.42 x (1.116054837)(YR-2000) , R2 = 0.9631 (Chart 1)
(Expected Value)S&amp;P500 = 30.287 x (Earnings) - 956.11, R2=0.6265 (Chart 2)
(Expected Value)S&amp;P500 = 49.538 x (Dividends) + 14.672, R2 = 0.9583 (Chart 3)
(Expected Value)S&amp;P500 = 2.7919 x (Earnings)1.4292 , R2=0.6253 (Chart 4)
(Expected Value)S&amp;P500 = 56.174 x (Dividends)0.9669 , R2 = 0.9614 (Chart 5)

Second, let's summarize the 5 long-term formulas with their respective coefficients of determination:

(Expected Value)S&amp;P500 = 697.34 x (1.071114826)(YR-2000) , R2 = 0.9733 (Chart 6)
(Expected Value)S&amp;P500 = 20.507 x (Earnings) - 11.444, R2 = 0.9134 (Chart 7)
(Expected Value)S&amp;P500 = 52.492 x (Dividends) - 58.342, R2 = 0.9391 (Chart 8)
(Expected Value)S&amp;P500 = 12.571 x (Earnings)1.0978 , R2 = 0.9464 (Chart 9)
(Expected Value)S&amp;P500 = 20.472 x (Dividends)1.2588 , R2 = 0.9706 (Chart 10)


Third, let's summarize the input data for 5 different periods between 3/31/2018 and 3/31/2019:
 
(Table 1)
 
Fourth, let's compute the expected values for the S&amp;P500 Index for each period using the 10 formulas and weight the results by the respective coefficients of determination for each formula:

Say there were two companies that were totally identical in every way – the only difference being the amount of equity of each company.

Company A had equity of 1 million dollars and an income of $100,000 for the year and company B had equity of $100,000 and an income of $100,000 for the year.

Obviously, for the year, company A had an ROC of only 10% whereas company B had an ROC of 100%. Which would you consider the superior company? Company A’s equity is now 5.5 times greater than that of company B’s (1.1M vs .2M) but would company B’s greater ROC for the year be indicative of their ability to generate greater future income (as opposed to being nothing more than a misleading variable created by the company’s unusually low equity)? Basically, if you just saw these two numbers (the equity and income amounts of the 2 companies for the past year), and nothing more (work with me here), could it be presumed in any way that company B would generate greater income than company A in the following year?

gorillaz0e;1520859513;83urap;;11;;95;"In commemoration of the bull market’s 9th anniversary, we wanted to take a brief moment to highlight some of the equity market’s biggest winners and losers over the last nine years.  We’ll start with the losers.  Within the current universe of S&amp;P 1500 stocks, a total of 60 names have share prices that are lower now than they were on the day the market bottomed.  That’s a pretty amazing forgettable accomplishment when you think about it, and suggests that these companies — whether through their own fault or the fault of a larger macro trend — have had some major issues to contend with.  The table below lists the 21 current members of the S&amp;P 1500 that have seen their share prices decline 50% or more during the bull market.  Most of these names are either small or mid-cap names that you may have never heard of, but a lot of companies formerly considered high-quality, like JC Penney (JCP) and Barnes and Noble (BKS), are also listed.  The only two stocks listed that are in the S&amp;P 500 (highlighted in grey) are Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Range Resources (RRC).

Now to the winners.  Since the bull market began, 206 current members of the S&amp;P 1500 have been ten-baggers, meaning that investors who held them the entire time have made over ten times their money.  Below we list the 25 best-performing stocks of the group.  All 25 of the names listed have gained more than 3,000% (thirty times your money), and 12 are up by over 5,000%.  The biggest winner, though, has been Patrick Industries (PATK).  On March 9, 2009, PATK closed at 16 cents.  Nine years later, its share price is $64.70 for a gain of 41,480.98%!!! Most people have never heard of PATK, but looking at the list there are a number of well-known S&amp;P 500 companies as well.  As shown, GGP, United Rentals (URI), and Netflix (NFLX) are all 50-baggers.

EU should design a plan that targets American strategic sectors that use Aluminum and Steel other than automobile industry. If there is a sectors and final products which use Aluminum for more expensive and higher end products. Tarrif will increase the price of Aluminum to begin with putting USA manufacturer in disadvantage. The second part is having EU, Japan, and other Nations put Tarrif on USA manufactured end products. So it will make it even more expensive getting slapped by two layers of Tariffs. At the same time we will start similar industries that produce the same thing America produces by aluminum, the high value items. We will produce them cheaper in Iran, Germany, Britain, Japan, Brazil, or China. While not slapping any Tarrif on it. Then when consumer see American product is 30 percent more expensive than same Item produced elsewhere they naturally will forego American products. It will be start of the punishment. Then we send item we produced also to American Market to and have our products at cheaper price available to customers in USA. We can even have them subsidized for USA. By export to America itself we will be taking over US markets as well. Then we close American industries for end products from Steel and Aluminum. We turn America to our commonwealth nation and will have US produce me steel and Aluminum for export it to us. Yes, we will have USA smelt raw steel and Aluminum after we killed their high end industries the way I just explained.

roskalov;1521022590;84ca83;;18;;36;"Hello there,


I started investing recently and go long only, hence try to choose those securities that have a potential over the next 30-40 years ideally.

I have noticed on this sub that many people are quite sceptical about Amazon and their PE of 200+.

However, I have looked at their report (Dec 2016 is the most recent one) and I thought it would be wise to also consider their net capital growth in addition to net income.

Example:

In 2016 their net income was $2.37bn, which constituted to $5.01 per share (hence the PE).

However, they also got a net capital gain of about $17bn ($20bn assets -$3bn liabilities).

In my view, that is another $17bn of ‘real’ income, which is 7 times more than the net income figure.

Therefore, would that be fair to say that the PE (capital gain adjusted) would then be 7 times less, hence circa 30? Not theoretically of course but as a common sense fact - that $17bn capital growth should not go unnoticed.

Hence my point that Amazon is a great long investment.

Thanks for your opinions.

Hello!
Since my Alphabet write-up I haven’t been able to write something, however I decided to make a write-up for my analysis on the chinese e-commerce company JD.COM.
Like always, this is written based on my own business and fundamental analysis. Anything written here is my own opinions and you’ll do whatever you want with that information.
______________________________________________

**The company JD.com**  
JD.com is an chinese E-commerce company operating in a similar way that Amazon ($AMZN) did before Amazon branched out into various industries. JD is today China's largest retailer, selling everything they are able to online. This includes but is not limited to electronics, clothing, food, medicine and similar products. This makes JD a true one-stop-shop for most chinese citizens. The business focuses primary on online-retail, logistics networks and data-driven method development, which very closely mirrors that of Amazon's core business apart from their subscription model. Apart from their retail, JD has multiple daughter-ventures, like JD finance. JD finance is a financial arm of JD focusing on lending, credit systems, financial supply chains, payment methods and crowdfunding. JD runs China's largest crowdfunding site.

______________________________________________________

**Fundamentals**  
JD is today unprofitable. In the year of 2017, JD held a revenue of $57 billion, which after cost of goods sold are payed end up being $7 billion. When the operating expenses are paid as well as the company reinvestments, JD sees a loss 1%. The core of JD:s business model right now is growth, and it does so at the cost of its margins. Gross margin of average 14%, and just slight negative net margins. Though all of that, right now JD is net cash positive with $3,3 billion in its war chest after debts are paid. The result of those numbers is that with the current rate of loss, JD will stay afloat for one year without taking on debt, raising more capital or adjusting its margins for the better. 14% of JD:s operating income is R&amp;D and technology, and that number is increasing 45% per quarter (with the Q4 2017 having the massive increase of 75%). This number is a few % points below the increase in overall operating expenses, showing that their technology investments increase the fastests of any expense. This is matched by their revenue gain, which is 41% year to year. This amazing growth makes JD the fastest growing retailer in the country of China, growing right next to Alibaba which is the only retailer which matches JD:s growth. JD have over twice the current growth rate of Amazon. 

_____________________________________________________________

**Forecasts &amp; predictions**  
JD has an incredible growth for a company of its size. A large portion of that comes from the fact that China have a huge event ongoing, which is the raise of the middle class. A huge number of households are raising itself from poverty into well-doing middle class. China's retail sales are increasing 11.3% per year, which is over double that of Americas (4,22% annual increase average y/y). This means that not only is JD:s market share growing, but the market as a whole is growing rapidly. This is the recipe for true growth, similar to that of which Amazon have done in US online sales. If we assume that JD:s revenue growth peaks next year (which is an extremely negative outlook), and then falls off 4% growth yearly until it reaches only 11% growth in 2027 and negative revenue growth in 2032 (with a -2% maturity from that point forward), we get a fairly negative view on JD:s revenue prospects. We combine this with an operating expense that matches the operating margin today, we see a company that has a net present value of nothing. This is the crux of fundamental analysis on unprofitable high-growth companies. JD:s growth numbers are fantastic. That is undeniable. However, the margins and reinvestments that are made today are unsustainable, which means we have to take a look at how we can predict JD to evolve. 

**Margin issues**  
Today JD holds a gross margin of 14%, which is extremely low, and a operating margin that is just negative. The only thing that makes JD a valuable business is the idea that one day they will increase their margins which is much easier said than done. A part of the massive growth that JD sees comes from their rapid expansion. They have to build offices, distribution centers, data centers, manufacturer relations, logistics networks and much more. Growth costs a vast amount of resources. So the key to profitability comes not from additional growth, but an improvement of their margins. This comes naturally as growth slows down, but to really improve takes work. The question is, where does JD end up if they succeed? We make an educated guess by looking at similar businesses. Amazon is a very similar business, which today sees a gross margin of 36%, over double that of JD. Another perhaps even more similar company is Alibaba, a chinese E-commerce platform which business model looks more like that of Ebay than Amazon. Alibaba holds a great gross margin of 57%, and have never seen a lower one. Amazon's’ lowest gross margin it has seen is 22%, which is quite a bit closer to that of JD:s. A last but less similar example is Walmart, known for razor thin margins, which has a gross margin of 25% (and its worst historically is 24%). This shows that it is possible to be a retail focused company with higher gross margins. So what this comes down to is can JD compete in pricing if it would increase its prices and therefore margins? How similar will JD:s path to profitability be that of Amazon? Will JD be able to do it before they collapse under its own expenses? 
These are tough questions.

As you can see, JD:s margins are extremely weak compared to companies in the space, and a majority of that comes from their gross margins, which they maintain low to compete on prices. 

_______________________________________________

**Opinions, Price targets &amp; Verdict**  
I think JD.com is a great purchase, however it does come with quite some risk. Today, the market prices JD as if in 2019 they will increase their gross margin by 1% until 2024 they reach 20% gross margin (below Amazon worst public gross margin), where they will end up. This assumes what I mentioned above, which is the pessimistic view that the next year is growth peak. My pessimistic but in my eyes realistic view, JD will continue to fuel this expensive growth until they can’t, and at that point they will be big enough to gain pricing power and improve their margins. My model assumes a declining revenue growth rate after 2018, which is partly to compensate for inaccuracies and risk, but also since it’s impossible to predict the future. In reality, it is very likely they will grow faster or at least maintain growth over a longer period of time, but it is hard to impossible to predict. I prefer a pessimistic but realistic view. We also assume once profitable, they have a tax rate of 24% which matches other large chinese companies. For margins, the tough part, we assume that in 2023 they will start reinforcing their margins, increasing the gross margin 1% per year while maintaining operating margin ie. keep reinvesting profits similar to Amazon. They maintain this margin growth until 2032, at 23% gross margin, which is just above Amazons worst public gross margin (as well as 5% less than Alibaba's CURRENT gross margin). If we assume this we see a net present value of $52,6 per share (scenario A). This gives a 20% upside on the current price in the current situation. If we aim for what Amazon is today, you can look at the much more optimistic view of reaching Amazon's margins by 2032, we see 141% upside with a net present value per share of $106 (scenario B). In my eyes this margin growth is highly unrealistic. A last scenario could be where they struggle to improve gross margins, start increasing their margin in 2022, and at 2025 they reach 18% margin and then fail to increase it further, we see 47% downside @ $23 usd per share (scenario C). All these calculations were made with assuming a discount rate of 8% and permanent maturity of -2%.


These scenarios are all possibilities, and the truth is that JD:s future is very uncertain. It cannot be predicted. What we do see however is that their value hinges on their extremely low gross margins, and how well they can increase it will decide the company's future (and todays value). We can easily predict extreme swings by taking the realistic scenario A, and see what happens if JD would maintain their current growth until 2021 before having growth slow down. We get a fine fine upside of 339% @ $193,5. Even in the less profitable scenario C, if we maintain the current revenue growth we see over 200% upside. This really shows the massive growth JD is seeing, and this is the ground floor. All JD have to do is to improve margins, which is much easier said than done. However I think they will manage, and I love some exposure to the rise of the chinese middle class, which I think is one of the most profitable trends on earth right now, apart from the war on cash.

If your capital losses are more than your capital gains, you can deduct the difference as a loss on your tax return. This loss is limited to $3,000 per year per person, or $1,500 if you are married and file a separate return. Any excess losses can be carried forward to future years.

http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTvTOY3WAAAz1-S.jpg

For the second year in a row each asset class on this chart was positive. 2017 was a good year for investors.

Looking at this list also serves as a reminder that next year the 2008 data will drop off the 10-year return numbers. So while the current 10-year numbers look pretty good, barring a market meltdown in 2018, the 10-year numbers at the end of this year are going to look fantastic for most of these markets.
Investors who pick their holdings based exclusively on past performance are going be in heaven when they see these results which will likely lead to disappointment for many.

This is my favorite performance chart for a number of reasons:

    It reminds me to stay humble. Predictions about the top (or bottom) performing asset classes in any given year are hard. There are probably some rules-based strategies to sort these asset classes to do a little better than a simple strategic allocation but there are many ways in which to do worse by trying to select the best one year in and year out.
    It reminds me to think and act for the long-term. Charley Ellis once said, “The average long-term experience in investing is never surprising, but the short-term experience is always surprising.” One-year performance numbers don’t really tell you a whole lot. Even the 3- and 5-year numbers can be misleading in most cases so it takes a lot of discipline and patience to be an actual long-term investor to think beyond short-run performance numbers.
    It reminds me how random markets can be. Sometimes the worst performer in one year becomes the best in the next year and vice versa. Sometimes these asset classes go on hot or cold streaks and put together a string of solid or subpar performance. Cash makes for a lousy long-term investment option (especially at current rates) but can be a top performer when risk assets sell-off. Even 10 years can show terrible returns on your stock investments (see international and emerging markets over the past 10 years as a perfect example).
    It reminds me of the importance of diversification. Diversification is a boring way to invest but it’s the simplest form of risk control for those who would like to avoid going broke or losing their mind in the markets. You’ll never get rich overnight by diversifying but you’ll never lose it all overnight either. When markets are rocking (as they have been wont to do of late) diversifying makes you feel silly but there will come a time when it comes in handy.
    It reminds me of the importance of understanding the concept of mean reversion. No asset class outperforms always and forever. It may have felt like international stocks or emerging markets or even commodities were dead money in recent years as they all got destroyed by U.S. stocks. Eventually, these cycles turn, often before you can prepare for it or find a legitimate reason for it.
    It reminds me how vast the investment universe is. This is a fairly broad group of asset classes. There are many more options available to investors these days beyond this group. I could’ve created one of these using sectors, countries, risk factors, alternative investments or hundreds of different variations. Last year someone took my quilt and added Bitcoin to the mix. Creating an asset allocation is the easy part. Being content with the portfolio you choose and avoiding the temptation to constantly tweak it and make changes is the difficult part.

* ""We're making big investments. ... It's about finding the right ones. The way we like doing things is not to throw a hundred things against the wall and see which one's going to be good or not.""

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

Three Former Newell Directors to Drop Their Proxy Fight
Starboard is open to giving activist Carl Icahn a chance at fixing the consumer-products conglomerate

A trio of former Newell Brands Inc. NWL -0.86% directors will part ways with the activist investors they aligned with in a proxy fight, opting out after the company struck a deal with activist Carl Icahn.

Starboard Value LP enlisted the directors in an effort to oust Newell’s entire board and CEO. Starboard said Tuesday it still may seek some board seats this spring, but is open to giving Mr. Icahn a shot at fixing the consumer-products conglomerate, the firm said Tuesday.

Newell declined to comment.


Newell’s deal with Mr. Icahn will give the billionaire control over five of 11 board seats.

“My agenda was not to win but to change the attitude within the company,” said Martin Franklin, one of the three former Newell directors working with Starboard. He was chairman of Jarden when Newell acquired the company in 2016. “Carl Icahn is putting his money where his mouth is and if he wants to sort this out, I wish him all the best.”

Newell, which makes products including Elmer’s glue, Sharpie markers and Graco baby strollers, has been mired in conflict for months as CEO Michael Polk clashed with a board increasingly critical of his performance. Mr. Franklin and two other directors resigned in January, while another two stepped down in recent weeks.

Mr. Franklin, who left after the Newell board rejected his proposal to remove Chairman Michael Cowhig, said Mr. Icahn “will be shocked” when he discovers bloated costs and financial maneuvering within Newell.

The accord with Mr. Icahn, unveiled Monday, will immediately add four board members chosen by Mr. Icahn and a fifth in coming months. Newell also agreed to explore selling more of its collection of businesses.

Without Mr. Franklin and his team, which included former Jarden CEO Jim Lillie, Starboard said it may still nominate its remaining director candidates. Starboard had sought to install Mr. Lillie to replace Mr. Polk as Newell CEO. Starboard is urging Newell and Mr. Icahn to comb the company’s entire portfolio for potential asset sales, and to make a case that substantial operational improvements are needed at the company.

Mr. Icahn recently disclosed he had amassed a 6.9% stake in Newell, while Starboard owns about 4.5%.

Mr. Franklin said before he aligned with Starboard he told Mr. Icahn that he wouldn’t run against him in a proxy fight. “All I wanted from day one was for Mike Cowhig to be removed as chairman and for the company to have a greater sense of urgency around the changes that need to take place.”";108237;Starboard drops proxy battle with Icahn over NWL;

3 MU @61.05 (picked up later, was gonna buy at 60.40 then my Prof walked in and sadly missed a great opportunity at a gain)

I picked up CHK because it has a decent amount of room to grow, been down lately and cheap

APTO because it's low and earnings are coming up and I don't know specifically how they're doing but I think it'll fare well with earnings

NS took a giant dip recently (still is dipping) and hoping to ride it a little, need to do more research on the company tbh I kinda messed up on that but I'm in so gotta stick with it

MU earnings are tomorrow and it was on the up, sadly I missed out on a .65 cent gain because I ran outta time before class started

* Apple is now the only company more valuable than Amazon.

* Amazon has surged 35 percent this year, dwarfing Alphabet's 4 percent gain.

* Meanwhile, Facebook's slide has dropped its value back below Berkshire Hathaway.


Note: I am a fan of all three, but I think something is wrong with the market. come on Amazon have cash of $19 Billion while Alphabet (Google) have $100 Billion and Apple have cash of $300 Billion. And also have less profit than both companies. However in terms revenue, it Apple- $229 Billion, Amazon- $177 Billion, and Alphabet- $110 Billion. Apple core businesses are Consumer Electronics/Hardware and Software; Amazon is ecommerce and cloud computing; and Alphabet (Google) is Google and Other Bets.

blackdragon1299;1521601268;85yx0o;;23;;6;"Facebook stock has been taking a beating recently, and the stock is crashing, but will it recover? Since a Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica collected data of up to 50 million Facebook users without their permission, the stock has been selling off. I'm going to give you 3 examples of similar things that affected companies - and how they DID recover. PLEASE NOTE that does does NOT mean this will be the case with FB as well, however, it's good to look outside the box on how similar selloffs have performed with time. If you prefer watching a video on this instead of reading, here's the link: https://youtu.be/xqQnUsmuUQk


* 1) Let's first cover the most recent - AAPL. Back in January, AAPL received a lot of bad press on reports on weak iPhones sales, consumers losing faith in the brand, issues with production of the iPhone X... The bad news went on and on. As a result, the stock sold off big time and could have been one of the triggers for the flash crash we had in Feb. Fast forward a month and a half later - and we are back near ATH in the stock. No matter what these articles said, AAPL still brought in BILLIONS in profit. Sure sales didn't meet analyst expectations, and thus retail investors panic sold - but the smart money came in and scooped up shares near $150/share and in just over a month, they are up over 16% on that investment.


* 2) The next example is SHOP. Back in October, short seller from Citron came out and released a video saying why they believe Shopify is a scam. And what happened? The stock sold off - it dropped from $120 to $90/share. This is when I bought some more shares in the company FYI as I thought that article was completely false. Now fast forward a few months later, and Shopify has not only recovered, but we're making new ATH - the stock closed at a new ATH at $150/share. Smart money once again came in when there was weakness and fear, and they scooped up shares for cheap. If you bought in at $90/share, you would be up 70% on your position - insane!


* 3) Still want more? Let's look at a 3rd example - Equifax. Huge article came out in September saying that hundreds of millions of users private data was leaked on Equifax. This included things like addresses, SSNs, drivers licenses, etc. - this was the worst data breach ever - and as a result the stock dropped from $143/share to a low of $89/share. People thought this was the end of the company, and a leak this large would put them out of business. But what happened? Fast forward a few months, and we're now at $123/share. If you bought in at the low at $89, you would be up 38%! It's not quite back to its ATH, but that's still a significant amount to be up in such a short time. Isn't that funny? Even though they LITERALLY had hundreds of millions of peoples data stolen, the company recovered somewhat, and this is still a 15B$ company. Bankruptcy? Psh - not even close.


So now - how does this all relate to FB? What I find funny here is that yes, the data was from FB, but this wasn't directly FB leaking the data - it was a company that worked with FB who chose to leak the data of 50mill users, yet investors are selling shares of FB? Sure you could argue that FB should have been stricter with their data they give out, but really, if someone wanted to leak it, it would eventually get out IMO. What I particularly like about FB right now is that I noticed that they now have a ""SHOP"" feature on instagram. If you don't know, FB owns Instagram. Now on Insta, you can actually see tags and links to products used in posts, and you can directly shop for them! This is something I've been waiting for a long time, and I think this will bring in a lot more revenue and profits for the platform. Not only that - Insta is really putting the fight up to Snapchat - and a lot of big celebs have switched platforms.

I currently still have my position in FB, and I have not sold ANY shares or options that I own. INFACT, I might actually sell off some of my other positions to take a bigger stake in FB. I'm still bullish, and my view is that this is just a blip in the long term view of the stock. Of course no one knows where this stock will go from here, so you should always do your own DD before investing - but these are just MY views on the stock and company.";108381;Facebook Stock - Why I think it will recover;

Not sure if this is the right forum for this question, but I was curious how you all digest your daily financial information at its most broad level.

I was a heavy user of Google Finance before this latest change (which made it unusable).  I'm looking for a new tool / webpage / portfolio to view some high level information.  

What I'm looking for on one page:

- ability to see the price, % change, and total market cap of those stocks

- one-day graph of market indices 

- news feed

snack-fu-bling;1521686381;8689cb;;15;;52;"Apple's services business is booming, and it could serve to offset reported softness in demand for the iPhone X, as well as smooth out the valleys in seasonal earnings drops expected to arrive this quarter.

According to a research note by RBC analyst Amit Daryanani, Apple is projected to see around 20 percent growth in services revenue this year thanks to ""increased monetiziation [sic] of install base"" and ""growth in the aggregate iOS install base."" 

Apple CEO Tim Cook during a quarterly conference call last year said the company aims to double the size of its service business to $48 to 50 billion by 2020. That goal is well on its way to being met, as the segment currently generates over $30 billion, Daryanani notes. 

""We believe [Apple] stock should continue to outperform the market driven by strong FCF generation, ability for outsized capital allocation and a growing iOS install base that generates sustained and recurring FCF growth,"" Daryanani wrote. 

Apple's services portfolio includes the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, iCloud and licensing. In its most recent quarter, Apple posted $8.5 billion in revenue in its services category, up 13 percent year over year. 

Daryanani's note comes at a time when various industry analysts have pointed out soft demand for the iPhone X, saying the handset is not selling as expected in part due to its high price tag

Nomura Instinet's Jeffrey Kvaal, in a note issued Monday and cited by CNBC, saw ""signs of trouble"" in iPhone demand, sentiments echoed by Longbow Research analysts Shawn Harrison and Gausia Chowdhury, according to Fortune. 

""Our demand checks suggest little improvement in iPhone demand in 2018,"" Kvaal writes. ""Corresponding supply chain downticks suggest iPhone expectations have yet to bottom."" 

The analyst sees ""further signs of trouble at the high end of the market,"" suggesting price is a major barrier to entry. Low interest in high-cost handsets does not appear to be an Apple-specific issue, as Kvaal's colleagues in Korea note Samsung Galaxy S9 preorders were down 30 percent. 

The narrative of lower-than-expected iPhone X demand has been forwarded by a number of high-profile analysts, including KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo, who in a note to investors in January said he believes Apple has reduced orders for the device. 

For its part, Apple says iPhone X helped drive its highest-revenue quarter ever, with the average selling price of iPhone rising to an all-time high of $796.42. In a follow-up conference call, CEO Tim Cook touted iPhone X sales performance, saying the device outsold its iPhone 8 and 8 Plus stablemates every week since its launch in November.

badpauly;1522008105;8739uw;;10;;29;"This is a list of the top 30 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

SmokinMan0123;1522162169;87j04l;;10;;0;"Eventually all companies will peak.  Even Amazon in the future will grow until it cannot grow any longer.  At which point they still have to make share holders happy, to do this the answer always seems to be layoffs or shutting down plants to help squeeze out an extra 2% growth in profits.

Not everyone will grow as large and as worldwide as Amazon so for smaller companies the peak growth can be reached rather quick in some cases and see the shutdowns, sells, layoffs happen sooner.  Now I can see how shareholders are useful and important to help a company grow but once the company has grown to its fullest extent then I can also see how shareholders can become a problem.  It gets to a point where companies value shareholders over their own product or employees when they get far enough into the game.

So my question is what is the endgame?  Just a endless repeating cycle of companies growing only to implode later?  Or can we come up with slightly different system where companies are not as depended on shareholders as they are today?

12manyNs;1522546270;88nct1;;13;;6;"Hello all,
I am ready to start buying into the stock market! My brief history of investments include crypto and buying into my own company stock through the ESPP. Both paid off very well but both were very speculative and risky.

To prep myself for investing in the stock market I read the intelligent investor. Benjamin Graham talks about a lot of different metrics such as to identify companies that are undervalued. I know there are caveats to each one but I was curious what others use as their number one metric to first start looking into (not necessarily buying) a companies stock? 

P/E? market value vs book value? net income? Worst performance over the past year or so (which would identify the company being potentially undervalued by a illogical market reaction)?

In my opinion it seems like looking at book value vs market value makes the most sense seeing that it is accounting for a companies total assets and companies selling for less than their book value should hypothetically be undervalued. What are the thoughts of more experienced investors?

Helliarc;1522602753;88sbzz;;44;;17;"To set the precedent, in case you didn't know, CPU graphics cards (GPUs) have had a price spike due to the crypto craze, where: 
""pricing for Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1070 should be around $380 (depending on the model), but that some cards are now being sold for more than $700 due to the stock shortages – an increase of more than 80 percent."" - [The Verge on GPU and Crypto mining](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16949550/bitcoin-graphics-cards-pc-prices-surge)

Now, due to the decrease in [Crypto share price (SP)](https://www.cryptocompare.com/), used GPUs are entering the physical market on Ebay and other for sale sites at a discount price, yet still not at preferred retail.  

If the recent news capitulating Crypto Currency is having [the desired effect](https://s14.postimg.org/dykxtl3ox/29871785_897559753758857_891397575085743026_o.jpg), then there should be a ""return"" of mining viability, which would in effect drive the GPU price back to near peak crypto market levels.

Could it be savvy, then, to buy out the physical used GPU market at ""relative"" discount prices, and resell on an assumed imminent Crypto market return?  It is currently a falling knife, but lets say the Crypto SP continues to fall into the week, could we effectively time a physical product buy time (On a trending early uptick of Crypto SPs) that could increase a Physical asset price from $600 to $800 with zero depreciation?  If timed correctly, I think I could get a hold of quite a few graphics cards at a relatively cheap price, just to resell them on the same marketplace BACK to the same people who sold them to me at a premium, sort of like a short squeeze but utilizing Craigslist, Ebay, Amazon, and Facebook markets rather than the stock exchange.

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

- EPS growth must be between 7% and 20%.
- Sales growth must be either 7% or higher, or at least 70% of EPS growth.
- The company must have positive free cash flow in last fiscal year.
- The EPS in each of the last 4 quarters must be higher than the corresponding quarter 1 year earlier.  (Essentially, 4 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth).
- Projected annual EPS for next year must be great than this year’s.

The result was two companies:

I got an alert on my phone this morning that China's new round of tariffs was already pushing the market downward and that it was poised to open in the red and near correction. Alas, when the market did open, the Dow/S&amp;P/Nasdaq were all down as predicted. 

Here is my question: How does the market move up and down if it's closed? Is the market opening lower because investors are pulling their money out or selling off in preparation of a downturn based on China's announcement? Are companies moving money? 

Another way to put it is thusly: A + B = C. In this case, A is China making an announcement. C is the market dropping. So what exactly is B?

Gamestop (GME) is such an opportunity but obviously not without risk.  The majority of the company’s sales and profits comes from selling game consoles and software.  The market is pricing in that the company will go the way of Blockbuster but if the company is still around then under practically any scenario there is upside.

The company is guided for $3-3.25 but I estimate $2.71 as a base case.  Despite the future potential miss, the stock is just too cheap and in my opinion, will be taken out via a private equity deal.  PE could easily leverage this up, make money and still make an offer around twice the current price.
That pretty much sums it up.  If you want to read more I published an article on Seeking Alpha, but really it all comes down to: a) Will it be around (then great opportunity), b) Will it be able to replace any future potential drop in margin (then great opportunity), c) Will it be taken private (then great opportunity), d) Any positive provides fuel to stock (then great opportunity), e) They will go out of business and PE won't be interested (then value trap and poor opportunity).

Longfin went to $140 due to a variety of factors. Bitcoin was just starting to go parabolic, and the news media was starting to compare crypto to the tech bubble. Plus, Longfin represented crypto's entrance into the sector of international trade, Longfin being in the business trade finance. The final factor that caused the parabolic interday move was that longfin had very few shares available to the public, only 10 million, many already held. Dow was also making new all time highs
It was also a recent ipo, so the market still hadn't discovered its price yet. The reason I said go big on LFIN though, was very simple. The price fluctuations were extreme, and when it retraced the full move, how much lower could it have gone? It was due for at least one more quick uptick. Also, Russel 2000 delisted the company due to lack of available shares!!!!!!!! Once it retraced the full move, it was like hitting 77777's on a slot machine.

Powell is talking four hikes, but I don't think he will for long, because Trump likely believes that the market / the economy needs to run a little hotter. 
In addition, I think the threat of the trade war is meant to put the Chinese on the back foot and diminish the impact they will have with North Korea. 
You will note, possibly, that the CIA and the state department have already started secret talks with the NKers. 
South Korea was once threatened with tariffs, and Trump backed off.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

DTRS_Investing;1523281453;8ayi7b;;12;;72;"Between Election Day 2016 and February 2, 2018, the VIX remained below historic averages.  This relative calm resulted in unusually high risk-adjusted market returns for 2017 and lowered our tolerance for volatility.  On April 6, 2018, the VIX closed at 21.49.  This is higher than all of 2017 and nearly double the 2017 average value of 11.09 (see chart).


So how does this compare to other years? Looking at the 28 years since the beginning of the 1990's, the mean value for the VIX was 19.35 (Std. Dev. = 7.86). Similarly, looking at the 9 years since the market bottom in the Great Recession, the mean value for the VIX was 18.11 (Std. Dev. = 6.82). Using these historic values, the April 6 close was only 0.3 to 0.5 standard deviations above the 28-year and 9-year means, respectively (see charts).


As readers can see, the current level of the VIX is actually returning back to a more normal range now than the unusual calm of 2017. Putting the VIX fears aside, where is the S&amp;P500 Index relative to its projected value?  Back in September 2017, we calculated a expected value for the S&amp;P500 of 2645 for 03/31/2018.  In early March 2018, the expected value for the S&amp;P500 was updated to 2592 for 03/31/2018. The closing price for the S&amp;P500 on April 6, 2018 was 2604.47 which is right in-line with the expected values.  While this closing price is down roughly 10% from the recent highs, the good news is that our most recent S&amp;P500 expected value for 03/31/2019 is 3030. This price appreciation equates to a 16.4% gain from current levels and depends largely on projected EPS of $158.49 by 03/31/2019.  Adding approximate 2% in dividend yield brings the total return to 18.4%.

Conclusions:
Investors should get used to more normal levels of volatility and not live under unrealistic expectations of another 2017. Despite the recent 10% correction, the S&amp;P500 price is sitting right where it should be at 2604. Barring problems with the yield curve, earnings falling short of estimates, trade war fears or other recession triggers, the S&amp;P500 could return 18% over the next 12 months.

rational_exuberance;1523328807;8b4e3u;;15;;64;"Here is a piece from Chris Cole. Any thoughts?

&gt; Chris: So, in 1987, we’re coming in after a long bull market in equities. But inflation was really low. Actually, inflation was lower in January of 1987 than it is today. So the Fed had lowered interest rates in an attempt to get inflation up.


&gt; And then, in a short period of time, we saw inflation jump violently. Some graphs, actually, that show this show the jump in CPI in 1987 – a period between January into the summer – inflation jumped almost 300 basis points.
&gt; And what we saw at that point is that nominal rates jumped even higher. So a period of, really, five to six months you have inflation and nominal interest rates shooting up over 300 basis points.


&gt; Now, the market liked this. This was a bull market. People forget this. From January to August, the equity market in the US exploded, jumping up over 36%. We were in the middle of a bull market. The market’s up 36% in the year.
&gt; And that’s when the wheels fell off.


&gt; Because it was the very sharp increase in interest rates and the losses in the bond market that began to cause a liquidity squeeze. That liquidity squeeze started a fire. And all of a sudden inter-bank lending jumped. All of a sudden credit conditions began to tighten.


&gt; And this started a fire in equity markets. And equity markets dropped. They dropped a little over 10% between late August and October. And that was the first fire.


&gt; Now, portfolio insurance, similar to the short-vol trade today, was like a barrel of nitroglycerine sitting in the market portfolio. I can be sitting here and have a barrel of nitroglycerine in my office and it can be incredibly risky. But if nothing sets off that barrel of nitroglycerine it may just sit there for years.


&gt; Well, portfolio insurance had these short Gamma, short-vol characteristics to it. But nothing can trigger it. All of a sudden you had inflation, jumps to nominal interest rates, leading to a liquidity squeeze, and the losses on bonds. The Fed was not able to respond because inflation was jumping.


&gt; So the Fed couldn’t come to the rescue. This caused a liquidity squeeze which started the fire. You had about a two-month decrease in equity prices. Which then led into the nitroglycerine of portfolio insurance leading to a down-20% day.


&gt; So the thing that could potentially cause this to unwind may be the thing that they’re trying to spur on, which is actually inflation. And that could occur amidst a booming market. But if you have a fast increase in interest rates – too fast – right at the point in time where many companies are looking to roll their debt, this could cause a liquidity squeeze that could cause the short-vol trade to unwind quite violently.";112999;Similarities between 1987 and today?;

cringelogic;1523626563;8bz78j;;26;;64;"Hi all. Just started investing a few months ago and have accounts with Schwab and robinhood, not a lot of money in either right now. I discovered robinhood a couple months after Schwab and really like it.

I have some money I want to put in VOOG long-term. Part of me wants my long-term investments to stick with Schwab just because they’re established and I feel more comfortable with that.

But at the same time it feels silly to pay the commission when I can invest is the same ETF for free with Robinhood. They’re legit and insured and all that too, I have the same risk with them I do with any brokerage.

I feel like I’m being unreasonably wary of Robinhood, right now I just have a few hundred bucks in there for stocks only. Is it unnecessary for me to be this cautious? Should I just put my money in robinhood and save on the commission fees? I plan on contributing to this fund every week, so $5 commissions will add up on Schwab.

badpauly;1523820149;8chi18;;5;;15;"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

CriticalFish;1523835383;8cj8s1;;17;;3;"I have been considering changing my portfolio to include dividend stocks / ETFs with at least a 4% dividend and reinvesting that dividend each quarter.  I am considering making higher dividend stocks about 30% of my portfolio. I am 32 and hope to retire by age 60.     

I plan on managing risk by creating 500 dollar positions in different companies.  With compounding I believe I would receive the following returns over a 27 year period. 

Dividend 4% - Compounded for 27 years provides an average return of 11.72%

Dividend 5% - Compounded for 27 years provides an average return of 19.12%

Dividend 6% Compounded for 27 years provides an average return of 29.96%

I used https://www.dividendladder.com/tools/dividend-calculator/ to find these compounded yields. 

These returns are with no increase in dividend payments over a 27 year period.  I understand stocks and ETFs with higher dividend do have risks, however, I am hoping to minimize that risk with having many small positions in different sectors of the economy.  
I also understand that companies paying dividends are not putting the money they are paying out in dividends into growing their business.  With these investments I would not be concerned with growth but instead the company maintaining current dividends or increasing them. 

I currently own T, HSBC, SPYD and I have been considering adding positions in IRM, STAG, MPW, APLE, PEGI, WPC, VTR, ED, ABBV.  

I feel like there must be a flaw in my logic, what am I missing with this plan?

Keeppgoingg;1523891234;8co75l;;5;;53;"Hi everyone. I work on the buyside and have access to resources many here do not. I figured that I could add to the community by putting out a weekly commentary on the tech market / stocks. This doesn't cause a conflict of interest for me since I will focus on broad themes and moves, rather than pitch individual stocks with specific price targets (which is my job). Below is my first attempt. I know there is a lot I can do to make it better, and I'm open to all suggestions. 

http://zenanalyst.com/2018/04/16/weekly-summary-4-13-2018/

So the question I have for the community is, ""what would you find helpful in a weekly tech summary like this""? I'll do my best to implement them! 

Some ideas / changes I've thought about implementing for the next weekly column:
1) Post every Saturday morning. This gives me enough time to digest the entire week, and leaves room for Friday night surprise announcements. 
2) A screen for weekly movers, with commentary on the driving factors such as earnings, regulation, sector rotation, etc. 
3) Start with a summary and proceed in chronological order from Saturday through Friday. 

Thanks for your feedback!

* Now first off - as a consumer - I love this service. Been using it for about 3 years now, and no plans to stop. It's one of the few services I use almost EVERY SINGLE DAY. I would say the majority of my friends have a Spotify account as well and whenever we are out at a party and someone wants to play a song - Spotify is the go to app. But does this company have a good future from an investment perspective?


* So first before we get into the nitty gritty, let's take a look at their business model. What I found was that they work on a freemium model to convert their free users to premium users (there's a graphic I have on this that's in the video...). The benefits for Premium include Ad-free music, On-Demand - so you can select and play any track you want - and they allow you to play songs offline. They claim that this is the ideal model as it helps them attract users who want a free-ish platform, and over time convert them to a premium user. However the drawback here is that converting a user from free to premium takes time, and once they are premium, it takes time to pay off. In fact, Spotify says that it takes them 12-months to break even on subscribers - so that is a long turn around time even after a user starts paying for the service.


* I can really see Spotify being something pretty big in the future, however, competition is heating up as they currently they compete with Apple - Apple Music, Amazon - Prime Music, and Google - Google Music. They also have smaller competitors like Pandora and TuneIn on some levels and this right here is my biggest red flag - however it may not be all that bad. They are continually growing with DAU and MAU YoY (graphic in video) - which is a good sign - but eventually this will slow down and they will need to look at other sources for revenue.


* I really like comparing Spotify to Netflix - back in the day when Netflix was building up steam, people compared it to Google Play Movies, Hulu, Prime Video, etc. But NFLX has managed to break past the hurdles and really leapfrog the competition - they are the GO TO platform for TV shows and movies. And how did they get here? IMO it was through Original content - and this is how I think Spotify is going as well. The way I see Spotify is that it will eventually become it's own record label and they will hire artists to create songs and albums exclusively for the Spotify platform. This will encourage people to stay subscribed to Spotify, and will encourage new users to join the platform. If they continue on their current path, sure their user base will keep growing, but how can they truly monetize?. Subscriptions only go so far, and eventually they need other sources of revenue. Maybe we will see concerts hosted by Spotify, maybe they will host exclusive music festivals? There's a lot of potential - but we have yet to see them to anything significantly different from just Music Streaming. Podcasts are picking up popularity on Spotify - which is another growing segment for streaming - but this will eventually hit the same hurdles they currently face with music streaming. 


* Revenue has been growing YoY (graphic in video), however the bulk of it is from subscriptions and very little is from advertising. I think that this advertising piece needs to be a lot bigger to take them to the next step.


* So should you buy Spotify stock? Well, they are currently a company that is focused on growth, not profits and this means they are fine with losing money in the short term for potentially big profits in the long term. This is not a stock for value investors, but it may be a good stock for growth investors due to the potential market reach they could have in 5, 10, 15 years. I personally am going to continue being a customer of the service, but as of right now, I'm not going to be an investor until they can prove a model to me that shows consist profit in the BILLIONS.

""Second, the index performance used to calculate your payments likely won’t include dividends. This trims gains significantly—since 1926, the S&amp;P 500 total annualized return (including dividends) is 10.0%. Absent dividends, it’s just 5.8%. That 4.2 percentage point gap is gigantic when extrapolated over long time periods. And then there is inflation—historically 3%, it eats away at indexed annuities’ returns even further.""

WhaleTrader1996;1524238386;8dohji;;27;;2;"Hello fellow Traders,

I am a long time options trader, 8 years of experience and have a sizable account but have become frustrated and disappointed with recent market volatility. I have read up on Dividend reinvestment plans and taking an initial investment and constantly writing covered calls and obtaining the dividends and reinvesting over time.

Obviously starting out with 5 or 10k would not bear much fruit until way down the road but it would be a start for someone.

I am 21 years old and am going to start this strategy with 500k, the current stocks I have come down to look to start this strategy are T, VZ and KO. The typical investor would always say “never put your eggs into one basket” but I’m going to do just that and sell constant covered calls and take the dividends of whichever stock I buy and put them right back into the same stock for a period of 3\-5 years.

After 3\-5 years of that I would hope to of accumulated enough shares to be able to get 4\-5K bi weekly off of covered calls and then start accumulating shares of another company, the goal is to eventually have 20,000 shares of T, 20,000 shares of KO and 20,000 shares of VZ by the time I’m 35 \(so about 13 years from now\).

Does anyone here think this is possible or am I just being too optimistic, I know people do this same strategy and could give me some valuable input/advice.

Does 2018 mark the end of consumer staple stocks as we know it? Are blue chip household brand stocks, those that pay big dividends, doomed? It certainly feels that way when tuning into the investing and personal finance media. Rather than relying on emotion or conjecture, I choose to look at the raw facts in today's video. I analyze two companies in particular, Clorox and Procter &amp; Gamble. Both have been facing recent issues in the media, although I interpret the fundamentals quite differently. Today's video starts with one of my favorite dividend stocks of all time, Clorox (CLX). Clorox just got downgraded by an analyst at Morgan Stanley. On the news, the stock fell 5.97% in a single day. However, when I look at the real facts, the fundamentals, I see a completely different story. * The dividend was just increased by 14%! * Sales are up 4% year over year. * Diluted EPS is up 9% year over year. Next, I discuss another favorite dividend paying stock: Procter &amp; Gamble (PG). I'm personally averaging into PG during 2018. With their recent earnings report, it seems like the media thinks the end is near for PG, and that profits are stalling. However, I only see good news: * Procter &amp; Gamble is acquiring Merck's consumer health business. * Revenue is up 4% year over year (1% organic growth). * EPS is up 5% year over year. Last, I close with ten lessons and takeaways for dividend investors, especially applicable to this wacky market: 1. This drop in consumer stocks is overdone. 2. I love a good buying opportunity like this! While it can be a bit scary, these types of markets tend to be the best markets for dividend growth investors (in my opinion). 3. I think there is more to come. There will be further dividend stock buying opportunities. 4. We could enter a major correction in the coming few years. 5. Could be a period of slower dividend growth. There is some truth to what the analysts are saying. 6. The sky is not falling. 7. It's a good time to remember diversification. 8. It's a good time to think about disruption, and to craft a disruption-proof portfolio. 9. Financial freedom is not without risk, although I personally embrace the risk. 10. Look at numbers oneself (don't just follow the analysts). In the world of investing and personal finance, I personally do not see a better alternative to dividend stocks. I especially enjoy dividend growth investing during times like these, when a correction is underway.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

I'm thinking if I do some strategic tax loss harvesting this year, I can reduce my upfront (and overall) tax bill.

Basically, I was thinking I could try to invest the money into a diverse basket of individual stocks -- I'm thinking stuff that could go big either way up or down. Whenever any incurs a significant loss I'll sell to lock in the loss and move into something else. Stocks that have significant gains I'll keep for at least a year. I'm hoping by doing this my overall average stock market gains for 2018 will roughly keep up with the market, while keeping gains unrealized and losses realized. Come 2019 I'll be comfortably back within the 15% bracket.

Any problems with this idea?

Tstandard;1524624939;8eqc47;;3;;0;"Hi, I'm not new to investing, but I recently decided I want to be a more active trader. Not with all my money, just a small portion I don't really need. Right now I wanted to start with $100 just to see if I can be profitable before increasing it to where I could actually make some money. I don't have to worry about commissions since I get 100 free trades a month with MerrillEdge thanks to having over $100k between BoA and Merrill accounts.

So after doing a lot of reading, I started yesterday and wanted to go over what I did, and see if I can get some feedback or tweaks to what I'm doing.

1) I used finviz to screen stocks, I used a filter I saw on one site: small cap, high average volume, 1.5 relative volume, in the NYSE. I looked at the charts for the stocks it gave me and settled on SFL, because it's chart showed a pattern of going down then up, and recently it had a large gap drop and started to go back up. (THIS IS PROBABLY THE STEP I NEED MOST HELP ON)

2) It had closed at $14.05 on Friday so I put a stop limit order to only buy if it went to $14.10 (to confirm that it was going to keep going up) and limit my cost to $14.15. (I THINK I DID THIS PART RIGHT)

3) I aimed for 7 shares as that was ~$100 and my account ended up buying at $14.15 (I'M KINDA CONFUSED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT TOUCHED $14.15 FOR LIKE A MILISECOND AND INSTANTLY DROPPED SO I'M NOT SURE WHY MY ACCOUNT BOUGHT IT AT THE MAX PRICE I SET??)

4) I set my stop loss at $13.85 and I arrived at this by setting it slightly below the previous day's lowest number. I should also mention that this was how I picked to put the full $100 into that stock, because the loss would be $2 which is 2% of my trading money and the money management plan seems to be the most important. I set my stop gain at $14.85.

5) It's been swinging around yesterday and today, but never hit either stop point, it's overall up to $14.25 though. Since it's just $100 it's easy to not worry about it but I kinda get the feeling if it was $10k instead I'd be pulling it out at $14.25 and taking the profit.

So, what do you all think? Anything in my process that I need to change? Any resources moving forward?";115579;Trying to get started in swing trading, hoping for some feedback and advice;

AlexPitti;1524884208;8fh5gs;;6;;40;"Sales growth has been boosted by the decline in the dollar on a year over year basis. Therefore, the bottom line and top line are being augmented. The currency effect is a one time event. Some say the dollar is simply returning to its average price since the 10 year monthly median is $90.61. While that’s true, the year over year effects are still transitory. The key is to understand that these earnings can be sustainable without the growth rate being sustainable. The tax cut is more stable as it doesn’t change every day like currencies, but the spike in earnings growth caused by it is also temporary.

One theory as to why this has occurred is because the tax cuts and forex have provided one time gains. Investors are worried about peak earnings growth.;

Guidance for Q2 was for revenues to hit a record range between $924 million to $963.1 million. The company also announced a partnership with Chinese online retail juggernaut JD.com to link membership programs, allowing paying users of one platform's membership program to enjoy the perks of the other's premium features. With rapid growth and the stock valued at just over 3 times Q2 annualised revenues it looks very cheap.

badpauly;1525019686;8fsfxy;;1;;2;"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

Last week it went through a ticker symbol change to axxa. However apparently because they are switching from a company in Canada to one in Delaware there has been a delay in the actual share transfer. Meanwhile the stock has been going absolutely parabolic because of this share dependency but noone with tlnuf shares can sell. 

I know once those shares finally transfer and are sell-able the stock is going to correct real hard I have no delusions of that, at the end of the day it's a huge pump and dump short squeeze. My question is how do you think I should go about getting out of it when I can? Should I say screw it and just put a market sell on open or should I attempt a limit sell on the ask?

I only have 3 stocks 1 bank, apple and again AMD with 1/3 cash. I try not to remain in the same market but am very fond of tech so I find it very hard to pick something else. The bank was an attempt for that. I like the idea of just buying it and holding while getting a nice dividend wether it performs or not. 

How lucky am I? The way I proceed is to add a stock to my portfolio in seeking alpha and follow it for a while. I read news and opinions from there I make my own opinion. So far it's been rewarding.

I've lost a lot of money prior to that however... I won't go too much into details but it's only recently I can say I've had a wee bit of succes.

I still need to learn a lot and I wonder if having so little money makes it actually much easier to make profit, especially with some luck. I'm positive right now but who knows what awaits. If I stay in the market... it's up but it'll likely go down one day.

wannabemanwhore;1525504141;8h5y71;;41;;1;"Hi, I'm from Indonesia and new in stock investment. So about 10 days ago I decided to buy 3 stocks consisting of 3 of the 5 largest banks in Indonesia with nearly equal portions each.

My reasoning was that:

1. I wanted to be safe so let's buy large banks stocks. Historically, the 1-year return was very good, 30%-40% and had always grew YoY. There's no chance of these banks going bankrupt.

2. I thought in May, the price would soar, so I decided to buy a lot because I thought now is a good entry point.

3. At first I wanted to invest and not trade. So I thought I wouldn't mind the volatility but now it got scary.

I decided to spend about 75% of my asset to these 3 stocks. Shockingly, once I bought, the price dropped ridiculously since the very same day until now. Many believe that it will continue to drop until about September. This is so frightening.

My mistake was:

1. I didn't set any cut loss point. I thought I was gonna go for long term and I didn't think it was gonna end up this bad anyway. My mentality was ""I just lose money on paper, but one day the trend will reverse inevitably"". I thought I was gonna go for long term, but apparently I need the money to make more money. 

2. I invested too much for the first time, instead of doing a trial first. I really thought It was gonna go up.

Please help me how can I save these stocks? I'm thinking to average down once it reaches it's lowest point. I can't afford to lose this much as a beginner.

Alternatively, should I stop thinking about these 3 stocks at the moment and use what's left for investing in good bullish stocks?

One of the many pearls of wisdom dispensed by Warren Buffett is “Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Don’t forget rule No. 1”.  Unfortunately this is easier said than done in the real world. Fund managers are acutely aware of investor aversion to losses.

Losses on portfolios can be due to market movements in the price of the investments or when investments go under or default on their obligations. The latter is permanent capital loss, as there is no opportunity to recover the losses suffered. African Bank is an example of this. Investors may get some of their capital back, but will unlikely get a material portion of it back.

When suffering losses, an investor requires a return higher than the loss to return to breakeven.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

lykosen11;1525807077;8hzgcb;;38;;57;"**Hello!**

 I'm /u/lykosen11 and recently, I've seen tons of comment talking about the strength &amp; profitability of dividend stocks. Comments recommending someone to buy dividend stocks  to get results from their investments. It'll be a simple and short text to make the situation clear. To discuss this, we first have to set a few things straight.   

**What is a stock in a company **

This might look trivial, however, might not be as clear as new people think. When you buy a stock, you buy a slice of the company. With 1 stock in a company with 100 stocks outstanding, you own 1% of the company. However this is also ambiguous. What does that really mean?

Well, it means 1% of the company is yours. If the company doubles in value, your share double in value. If a company buys a building, you own 1% of that building. If the company hires a person, you employ 1% of that worker. If the company makes 100 dollars, you get 1 dollar. This would be very complex to keep track off, giving you strange fractional ownerships.  It becomes even weird if you get that dollar, and the company has to contact you to get that dollar when they want to pay their costs of revenue. It is solved with stocks. Instead of you getting ownership of each of these things, the company holds everything, and you hold a piece of paper saying you own 1% of everything. If the company earns 1000 dollars, 10 of those dollars are owned by you, no matter what they are spent on. If the company turns those dollars into product to sell, your value and ownership is just converted from cash into product. When the 1000 dollars are earned, instead of you getting 10 dollars from your 1% ownership, the company holds those 10 dollars, and your stock raise in value by 10 dollars. 


**Then what is dividend? **

Great question. Dividends are simply put cash that the company give back to its shareholders in the weird fractional way described above. A growing company needs its cash to finance its growth, and usually doesn't give a divided. They need the money to buy buildings, hire people, buy machines, buy product, everything. A non growing company however usually make more money than they need to run their business, and the cash starts piling up year after year. It can't profitably buy more things because their market is saturated, and it would give a shitty return to investment. So what do they do? If the overflow of capital would risk give a negative return on capital, they might as well give the capital out, securing a 0% return on overflowing capital. Technically a company could simply acquire another company or buy stocks. However this is all included in attempting in creating growth, and most companies aren't Intrested in acquiring random companies (Birkshire Hathaway is the great exception, where the company employs capital in many businesses, and becoming a form of holding conglomerate) 


There is a third scenario for the company to employ unemployable cash is to do stock buybacks. Buybacks are done when the company stock value is believed to grow, creating growth that way. It's a company investing it itself. If done while the company is overvalued it's a horrible investment, and if done when the company is fair or undervalued its a great investment. If our company has 100 shares of a dollar each buys back 50 shares, it becomes a company with 50 shares, each worth 2 dollars. The action itself means nothing, it only means that if the company intrinsic value raises, the owners (you) is rewarded. 


**So, do you want dividends? **

Well, it depends like most things. A company that gives dividends from earnings is a company that has realized it can't use its capital to grow. Note that a dividend company doesn't return more or less value to each shareholder. It's exactly equal, each Share gains the earnings per share each year. You do not get more cash from a dividend than a company without a dividend, the capital is simply allocated differently. There are also risks. If a company gives out a dividend while not earning enough, they have to pay the dividend in another way, usually though debt or stop giving a dividend. Also worth noting is that dividends are taxed when you get them, which severely hurts compound interest gains from the companys earnings.

 This means that if a company gives out a dividend, they shrink in book &amp; intrinsic value equal to the dividend given away at that time. 


**Ending**

A short finish. There is nothing intrinsically good about dividends. You get the money either way, either through dividends or appriciation of company value, which in line should appricate your share value. So TLDR it doesn't matter. Dividend giving stocks tend to be companies that is more matured, unable to grow but is still generating real cash flow. This in some cases makes the company stable. A great example of this is Tele providers. They can't grow, but generate tons of cash, giving large amount to its owners. In the opposite, a company that uses its earnings for growth still give its shareholders it's earnings, except they convert the cash into whatever the company needs to grow. A great example of these are any tech startups, or growth companies generally.

There is no intrinsical difference. You still get the money.";118287;Dividend, growth and capital Allocation;

Big technology stocks have soared in recent years as their rapid earnings and revenue growth made them must-have holdings in many investors' portfolios. Now, a new engine is likely to drive tech profits and stock prices in the coming years: ongoing streams of revenues from customer subscriptions, The Wall Street Journal reports. Software was the first area within the tech sector to change its preferred pricing model from one-time sales to recurring annual fees, the Journal notes. Today, the subscription pricing model has become pervasive throughout the sector, and companies that have embraced it include Apple Inc.

Andrewgolf;1526081477;8is6mi;;3;;20;"I've been suffering from depression and a lack of fulfillment for the last few years of college but have recently changed career paths, will be going to graduate school, and have started an interdisciplinary blog. I don't intend to ever monazite it, I am simply enjoying the benefits of formulating my thoughts and having a project...I would love your thoughts and opinions on my first post about the current state of the NYSE:

*I’m in the midst of many time consuming obligations \(including  setting up this site\), but I still wanted to take some time to publish a stock market outlook article… so this will be quite a shorthanded piece.*

The NYSE has been plagued by serious volatility so far in 2018, especially when compared to the reliability of the market in 2017. The general result has been buying apprehension and profit taking, which has created relatively stagnant returns. YTD, the DOW is up .08&amp;#37; \(up over 5&amp;#37; in the same period for 2017\), the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.85&amp;#37; YTD \(up over 5.2&amp;#37; in the same period for 2017\), but the underlying causes seem to be evolving for the better. While there are obviously an endless amount of variables responsible for this volatility, there are a few that stand out as the most substantial:

1.\) International Trade War Fears \(particularly with China\)2.\) North Korea’s Nuclear Pursuits and rise in relevant tensions3.\) The market’s susceptibility to President Trump’s comments and tweets4.\) \(These following all somewhat connected:\) Interest rate hikes/fears, Treasury yields rising, and Fed. Chair change from Yellen to Powell.5.\) Fear that the market had gone up faster than was justifiable6.\) Teach/Big Data Fears

While all of these reservations had justifiable underpinnings, many feel the market has been too cautious. Either way, many of these fears have changed as of recent and so here is my brief take/synopsis on each one:

1.\) Two day US delegation trade talks with China concluded on May 4th. Leaked documents and official statements suggested easing of trade tensions, promise of quarterly meetings, but still strong demands from the US.2.\) In addition to the the release of three American prisoners, North Korea has shown clear signs of what many hope and believe to be genuine demonstrations of intended progress. These include North Korea’s participation in the Winter Olympics with South Korea, Kim Jon\-un crossing the DMZ to meet South Korean President Moon Jae\-in to put an official end to the 65 year long Korean War, and most importantly Kim Jon\-un agreeing to denuclearize/officially scheduling a meeting with President Trump \(in Singapore on June 12\).3.\) While this susceptibility still exists, reactions are more subdued after a lack of actions following President Trump’s accusation that Amazon is a monopoly.4/5.\) While multifaceted, these fears were all largely connect to fears of stagflation \(rising inflation and stagnant economic demand\). All in all, many of these fears have been subdued by the following: on May 2nd, the FED left the interest rate target range the same \(1.5\-1.75&amp;#37;\), CPI \(consumer price index\) and PPI \(producer price index\) figures confirm strong growth, and the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest in a decade.6.\) Between fears of Apple earnings/poor iPhone 10 sales projections ,and possible regulation of Facebook, tech and big data stocks have been feeding the last month or two of hesitation. Despite this, Apple exceeded pessimistic sales predictions, was bolstered by an increased stake by Warren Buffet, announced 100million dollar stock buyback initiative, and as a result has created a resurgence leading to an all time high of over 190$ a share. For Facebook, despite the short lived uprising against data breaches, Facebook seems to be handling the situation well enough to avoid US regulation and continues to demonstrate innovative initiatives such as a dating extension.

Conclusion:All in all, things are looking up. Majors fear contributors have been subdued, the market is now oversold and provides numerous opportunities of value, and confidence is beginning to return in traders. When reentering, look for opportunities that have demonstrated impressive growth and fundamentals but who’s price has been held down by any of these specific fears. As I see it, these opportunities are prevelant in Chinese trade reliant companies, big tech, cloud storage, and some social media.";118859;Sparknotes Market Update;

MisterOdachi;1526086769;8isos9;;19;;8;"I held a call on Nvidia through their earnings report despite feeling like I should sell and keep the gains I already had. The drop after hours evaporated the gains and then some. Thought it might recover today but it hasn't.

In hindsight, I learned that all the hype surrounding Nvidia and the rise in the days preceding should have been a red flag to sell on earnings. 

So now I'm holding a losing call over the weekend, trying to figure out my next step Monday morning. I can double down on the calls and lower my average cost and wait it out, but I'm thinking Nvidia might dip more on Monday. What are the best tools to use to determine the trend? 

Are there any ""by the book"" plays for such a scenario? Is it likely to sink more based on a BB assessment? Would it be crazy to put on Monday morning or should I just double down on calls and wait it out?

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DcqzcKlU0AEyEoj.jpg

The indexes are widely used as a kind of shorthand for U.S. economic health, appearing on nightly newscasts and President Trump's tweets.

But for many, perhaps most, American households, those indexes measure an economy far removed from their own daily concerns. One figure from a recent working paper by New York University economist Edward Wolff illustrates that point: Fewer than 14% of American households directly own stock in any company.

Even when you consider indirect ownership via 401(k) retirement accounts and similar vehicles, about half of U.S. households don’t own any stock at all.

Until the early 2000s, stock ownership had been on the rise. From 1989 to 2001, the percentage of households directly owning stock rose to 21.3% from 13.1%, while the percentage owning any stock — including indirect ownership via 401(k)s — increased to 51.9% from 31.7%, per Wolff's analysis.

But since then, stock ownership has declined. The share of households directly owning stock in 2016 (13.9%) is similar to the share in the early 1990s. The total rate of stock ownership, including indirect holdings, has fallen too but by a slighter amount, owing to the continued popularity of 401(k) retirement plans.

mettle;1526141134;8iwyyv;;9;;2;"I was curious about leveraged ETFs and so I did a simple simulation. To my genuine surprise, an S&amp;P500 index ETF almost always outperformed a 2x leveraged index which almost always beat a 3x leveraged index over a 10- and 20 year horizon. 

This seems counter intuitive to me. My intuition says that if the index fund averages a 9% return yoy over the past few decades, a 2x leveraged index fund would return 18% and 3x 27%.

Does anyone have an clear explanation of the underlying math here? My brain can't quite understand it. Is it maybe related to the fact that N+10%-10%=.99N? That sort of seems to baffle me too.

The business is cyclical but it currently appears to be in the early stages of an upswing.  Demand is growing and supply is tight as OPEC reported yesterday that the global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, driven by plunging Venezuelan supply and Iran’s supply now looking doubtful. 

The contingent payment will be paid as a multiple of 2.75 times annual EBITDA for 12 months to June 2018 in excess of $18 million.  It is a number that has been growing strongly with FYE December 2017 EBITDA of $15.9 million up from $6.9 million in 2016 and guidance for Q1 EBITDA of $4.5 million up from $2.6 million last year. 

With such growth a significant contingent payout looks likely.  EBITDA of $27.6 million would result in a maximum payout of $0.45 per share.  A recent Daseke presentation suggest Daseke expects to payout the full amount.  But with the stock priced on CAD$0.97 the returns look skewed towards the upside with a CAD$0.90 payment almost assured (given large shareholder approvals) and returns of a further CAD$0.45 looking a real possibility.

Some Info: 

-New to the stock market
-Small account, started with 1000 a month ago. Was at 1600 this morning before the trade.
-I don't have the buying power to sell calls and puts. 
-Robinhood limits day trades to 3 within a 5 trading day span. If you exceed this you get flagged and locked out for 90 days. I've been reserving day trades for only the best scenarios.


The Trade:

$BZUN - spiked pre-market as a result of earnings call. Opened at 47.50 (+5.42%) . I opened a 55 call buy 6/15.

At roughly 52.00 (+16%) I opened a 50 call put 6/15 to ""lock in"" my gains, since I only have 1 day trade available to me.

At 53.25 (+18.17) I closed my 55 call 6/15 for gross 230.00 using my last available day trade.

 Currently sitting on the 50 put 6/15 at -110 and the BZUN is holding between 52.50 and 53.50 (+17-19%).

I believe it's more likely to end the day in a small pullback than rally again, allowing me to sell my put tomorrow for a net profit of 110-130. ";119945;New to options trading. Strategy on $BZUN;

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

gorillaz0e;1526997937;8la8co;;21;;1;"What have you learned, that you wish you knew, when you started investing in stocks?

The below is my subjective personal experience and opinion. I do not think my experience is necessarily right or valuable for everyone.

For me:

    Buying the broad indexes (e.g. MSCI World) is typically a good idea after a huge sell-off. It takes balls, and you might not hit the bottom, but it is often better to buy the dip than buy into a strong top formation.

    Many, not all!, losses can be averted, if you just forget about the investment, and let it sit for a few years.

    don't buy individual stocks. Buy well diversified funds, passive or actively managed.

    Broad diversification is good. Don't own stocks from just one single country or one sector.

    Gold miner stocks are to some extent a hedge, but this is a very dangerous investment. Those who bought gold exposure in august 2011 (when gold was expensive), are still in a huge loss today on that position.

    ""safe"" stocks like Pepsico and Hershey Co are not necessarily safe if they have high PE ratios and everyone have rushed to buy ""safe"" stocks in a low interest environment, where people see it as a low-risk alternative to getting 1% interest in their bank account.

    it is difficult to beat the market. When you manage to do it, it is often a result of luck, and not sheer analytical skill or technical trading talent.

    Avoid day trading.

ACCESSWIRE	ACCESSWIRE•May 21, 2018
BELGRADE, MT / ACCESSWIRE / May 21, 2018 / Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: XTNT), a leader in the development of regenerative medicine products and medical devices, announces U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for InTice™-C Porous Titanium Cervical Interbody System.

InTice-C is designed using OsteoSync Ti, a best-in-class, cost-effective, highly porous titanium scaffold material for improved implant fixation. The material more closely resembles the bioscaffold of cancellous bone, and further combines Xtant Medical's hardware and biologic portfolios. In addition to InTice-C serving as a bioactive scaffold, it is also cleared for use with Xtant's proprietary allograft lines, including OsteoSponge®, 3Demin® Cortical Fibers, and OsteoVive™ viable cell allograft.

""InTice-C represents Xtant's latest addition to our spinal implant portfolio and is our first spinal implant to be engineered using a best-in-class porous titanium material,"" stated Dr. Gregory Juda, Chief Scientific Officer and General Manager of Xtant Medical. ""The porous architecture of the titanium was designed to improve implant fixation, both prior and post fusion. We expect a positive reception of this technology from our surgeon customers in the cervical spine market.""

The InTice-C Is designed to provide cervical intervertebral body fusion options for each patient's varied anatomy. It is offered in multiple footprint, height and endplate options. The commercial pure titanium structure offers continuous pore interconnectivity from the top to the bottom as well as from the outer perimeter to the large central graft cavity of the implant. This optimizes vascularization to the fusion site allowing the implant to be a participant in the fusion process. The implant utilizes machined endplate structures in conjunction with the inherent texture of the porous titanium to provide migration resistance. The implant is offered in individual sterile packages. InTice-C was developed in collaboration with Sites Medical.

InTice-C will help the Company further penetrate the $285 million dollar cervical spine market. Xtant's other cervical interbody options include Calix®-C, Calix-C PC, Atrix-C®, and Irix®-C, which offer PEEK, PEEK with a plasma-coated titanium, a structural biologic solution, and a standalone cervical option, respectively.

About Xtant Medical

Netflix Inc. overtook cable giant Comcast Corp. in market value on Wednesday, highlighting the dramatic rise of video streaming at the expense of traditional television.

Netflix, the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index this year, set a fresh record with a gain of 3.4 percent on Wednesday, while Comcast fell 1.8 percent. That pushed Netflix’s market value to about $149 billion, surpassing Comcast at $147 billion.

It’s the second time this month that Netflix has dethroned Comcast in valuation, but the lead may have more sticking power this time. Shares of the video-streaming company have risen more than 5 percent this week, which began with the announcement of a multiyear production deal with Barack and Michelle Obama.

Comcast and other cable providers have faced growing competition from streaming services like Netflix, which are attracting more customers by adding original programming. Comcast said last month that it lost 96,000 video subscribers in the first quarter , a bigger decline than analysts had expected.

avigilburt;1527137266;8lq14a;;10;;0;"For those of you that have followed me through the years, you would know that I utilize Elliott Wave analysis to track the markets I follow within the context of both their smaller and larger cycles. And, to that end, you would know that I am neither a perma-bull nor a perma-bear. Rather, I see the market as it is, and not as I believe it should be. 

For example, when everyone was getting very bullish in late 2015, I warned that we were setting up for a drop from the 2100 region back down to the 1800 region. Yet, I also warned that investors should not get too bearish, since that pullback will set the market up for a multi-year rally pointing to 2600+ in the SPX.

If you remember back in early 2016, most analysis you were likely reading was preparing you for the inevitable market crash that everyone seemed to be certain was just around the corner. But, our Elliott Wave analysis put the market in appropriate context, and told us that we likely had several more years to come before the bull market which began in 2009 will likely end. I mean, have you ever experienced a market crash which was expected by the masses? Markets just don’t work that way.

As Professor Hernan Cortes Douglas, former Luksic Scholar at Harvard University, former Deputy Research Administrator at the World Bank, and former Senior Economist at the IMF, noted regarding those utilizing ""fundamental"" analysis to identify when a market swoon will occur:

""The historical data say that they cannot succeed; financial markets never collapse when things look bad. In fact, quite the contrary is true. Before contractions begin, macroeconomic flows always look fine. That is why the vast majority of economists always proclaim the economy to be in excellent health just before it swoons. Despite these failures, indeed despite repeating almost precisely those failures, economists have continued to pore over the same macroeconomic fundamentals for clues to the future. If the conventional macroeconomic approach is useless even in retrospect, if it cannot explain or understand an outcome when we know what it is, has it a prayer of doing so when the goal is assessing the future?""

Well, I am still of the opinion that we likely have a number of years to still run to much higher levels in the S&amp;P500. In fact, there is potential for this market to even exceed the 4000 mark in the early 2020’s before this bull market comes to end. Remember, the market will still have to rally far enough to convince even the most die hard of bears that this bull market is unstoppable.

However, that brings me to the point noted in the title to this article. You see, once this bull market convinces the masses of its invincibility, only then will it top in the early to mid 2020’s. And, when everyone is certain of the invincibility of this bull market, it will set us up to be heading into a period of time which will likely be worse than what we experienced in 2008. In fact, it can rival the period of time marked by the Great Depression.

For those that understand the context of the overall long-term market structure, the years between 2000 to 2009 actually represented a 4th wave sideways consolidation. That led to this 5th wave we are currently experiencing, which still likely has several more years to run. However, once this 5th wave does complete, we will likely enter into a 4th wave correction which is one degree larger than the correction experienced between 2000-2009. That means that the correction we potentially will begin in the mid to late 2020’s will likely be worse than one we experienced into 2009. In fact, the stock market can correct from levels exceeding 3500SPX back down to the 1000-1300 region. Moreover, that correction can last 10-20 years, as you can see from my long-term chart.

https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/images/charts/201805/full-zSwMhjUbgetQUZ5kvju9f.jpg

But, that does not mean you should be donning your tin foil hats, stocking up on water and dried food, and heading into your underground bunker just yet. Remember that knowledge is power, and if you have this knowledge of what potentially is coming, you can use the final years of this bull market to prepare for the largest bear market we have seen since the Great Depression.

While some of you will continue to view my analysis methodology as something akin to voodoo, I can assure you that it is well grounded in mathematics, and has been quite accurate for many years, which can be confirmed by those who have followed us closely during that time. The fact that we have over 450 money manager clients in the 6 years since we have been in business is a testament to how well we have prepared our clients for the machinations we have seen in the overall markets we follow.

And, as Ben Franklin stated: “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”

So, it is your choice. You can choose to continue to ignore our analysis and believe the market moves rather haphazardly as it is seemingly driven by the events of the times. You can choose to ignore how accurate our analysis has been regarding the turns we have been seeing in the markets for years. And, you can choose to continue reading analysis that ineffectively and hopelessly attempts to explain what the market did yesterday by fitting their square pegs of linear reasoning into the round holes of non-linear market action.

But, I can assure you that when the market will be topping out in the early to mid 2020’s, you and the great majority of the market will be wildly bullish, and assume that we have entered a new paradigm during which we will not see another recession again, much the less a period of time which can rival the Great Depression. Such a poor economic environment will be the furthest thing from your mind as the market hits heights that were unimaginable to you only a few short years ago. This is simply how markets and market sentiment have worked for hundreds of years.

Based upon much research, it is quite clear that, just like history repeats itself, so does the publics actions and reactions when it comes to long term trends in the stock market. Yet, our mathematically based analysis methodology focuses on being able to identify those long-term trends in the market, and has provided us with early warnings of the changes in both the smaller degree and larger degree trends.

Our model suggests that this bull market can still last into the early 2020’s (even though we will likely see a 20-30% correction kicking off in 2019 before we begin the final rally to end the bull market). However, once that last rally ends, you will need to be prepared for something that may seriously rival the Great Depression. 

While I will be keeping my members well apprised of my expectations in the coming years, along with the pitfalls they must avoid to protect their families’ financial well-being, the question you have to ask yourself is how will you prepare now for something that will undoubtedly blindside most in the market in the coming decade?";121047;There Is A Lot Of Financial Pain Coming For The United States Of America;

XEC: I have worked on Cimarex operations off and on for about 8 years. This company really has their stuff together and has always struck me as a company that will last. I bought in at $98 \(current price is around $95\) but i don't see it staying down for long. I know they went over budget last year but have recently trimmed the fat, dropping its most underperforming drilling rig. I am going to sit tight for now and if the stock drops below $90 i will buy much more.

NWF: MY experience with Newfield is limited but like XEC when i worked with them they seemed to be making the right calls. I'm not going into details about drilling practices but IMO they were doing things other companies weren't and still aren't that sped up operations. Also looking at their 5 yr chart they seem to bottom out in the mid/high $20s then jump to high $30s\-40s then repeat.

CHK: Yea i'll be honest that this was more of a WSB style YOLO than anything else lol. It has been a turd since i purchased months ago but has been taking off this last week and i am in the green finally. Exit strategy is ""to the moon"".

Many traders lose simply out of ignorance. They base their trades on hunches, news, or tips from friends, and do not define specific risk and profit objectives before placing trades. Others have the merit of educating themselves but fall victims of their emotions. They hold on to losing positions hoping they will turn into winners and sell winners by fear of losing a small gain. They over trade to fulfill a need for action or by fear of missing out.

The consistent winners follow a winning approach:   
1. They have a strategy to enter and exit trades  
2. They use good money management   
3. They take consistent actions, they follow a trading plan   
4. They keep good records so they can review their actions  
5. They avoid over trading   
6. They have a winning attitude

lykosen11;1527262837;8m2ptl;;73;;67;"China is today a huge emerging market, with the raise of their middle class being one of the largest macroeconomical processes going on in the world. In 2000, 63% of the Chinese population was considered rural, making the equalent of less than $9000 dollars a year. Today, this number is at just a bit above 40%. It's estimated that in 2050, China will have a full on American style Middle class. These numbers are important, but the specifics are not important. They peak Intrest.

When the middle class becomes a majority in China, it will lead to so many changes in their economy. Cash transactions will fall, media &amp; entertainment revenues will spike, online shopping will raise similar to other developed counties , mobile and internet usage raises quickly and technology will be developed and implemented faster. These trends affect tons in financial markets, and it's been my focus for the last 4 months.

JD.com, Tencent, Alibaba, IQIYI, Baidu.
All these companies that you hear off all the time all over the financial world the second China comes up. To analyze companies that provide services, you have to do estimates about their possible valuation must be multiplied by the development of China. As the market increases, so does revenues and afterward profits. Today, according to JingDongs research in their latest reports, Chinese retail market is increasing 11.3% annually, along with e-com that increases 21%. On top of all of these companies natural growth, they see this raise of the middle class and therefore increase in possible market size.

As a last note, there is an Intresting catalyst I'll do a write up on later, that will most likely happen during the coming year. As of today, all of these companies mentioned above are traded through international holding companies. They do not trade in the Chinese markets as well, but only though these American exchange posted cayman island / Marshall Island style holding companies. The Chinese government plan to during the coming year let these companies trade on Chinese exchanges, allowing all the Chinese investors to be let lose at the giants of their own country. Allowing these companies onto the Chinese stock exchanges would increase the investments into these companies, forming what will perhaps be a great catalyst for the companies. Today it's hard to know though, as the specifics are not nailed down. I am currently researching it myself trying to calculate make estimates, and will post my findings once I belive them myself. I'll be honest, it's hard. My mandarin reading is also weak. Many times weaker than my near worthless speech.

So what's the point of this post? Well, to give out some information which isn't obvious. Also my opinion that these companies are all worth holding, if you are willing to hold not only a risky growth company, but a risky growth company within a risky growing emerging market. If you are looking for something new, exciting, rewarding and challenging to research and understand, do like me and delve into China. It's been very challenging, but my models are starting to feel somewhat close to reality.

I have during these last 2 months increased my position in China to 31% of my portfolio, with the largest position of my holdings being in JD.com and a lot of love for the newcommer IQIYI

The constant ringing of bells, schedule of classes, lunchtime, homework, each a daily fixture throughout the academic year. It is no wonder then that most people tend to be conformists – the rigidness of school stamps out individualism in favour of conformity.

The irony of it all is that we celebrate the individuals who have managed to resist the rigidness and maintain their non\-conformist streaks. Our heroes are Steve Jobs not Jeffrey Immelt, Muhammad Ali not Floyd Mayweather, The Beatles not Coldplay.

Capital markets too have on occasion handsomely rewarded the contrarians, like Dr Michael Bury during the Global Financial Crisis, Paul Tudor Jones in 1987, and Jesse Livermore in 1929. Markets do not, however, look kindly upon the reflexive contrarian – the investor that cannot help but go against the trend. Markets can be conformists for extended periods of time and hence why momentum following strategies can be so rewarding.

We like to consider ourselves independent investors – investors that scour the market for signals that may provide us with opportunities to generate outsized returns. Our aim is neither to be contrarian nor momentum driven. Today, however, we see four areas of the market where the risk\-to\-return profile in being contrarian is far more attractive than in following the herd. We outline two out of the four areas of opportunity below and will outline the remaining contrarian opportunities in a follow\-up next week.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

legend18;1527479036;8mn69l;;4;;0;i live in Canada, im about to start investing in a couple of stocks, just what's a good website that supports canadian usage. i traded crypto curreny quite  a  bit, im just not trying to go on a fake site and have all my money stolen.;121715;will delete quickly, just need a question answered.;
dalastspartan;1527512657;8mpwk6;;14;;29;"What I understand so far is that there are 3 things one can do with an options contract:

Can let the contract expire worthless; can exercise the contract; can sell it back to the market.

Aside from all the technical things I'm most curious at this point about one being assigned, cause I think this will help clear up some misconceptions I have about options.

What I understand so far about being assigned, is that it occurs only when, say I sell a contract that is in the money and the person I sell it to decides to exercise it, and assignment means that the seller of the contract then owes the buyer (who just exercised the contract) 100 times the strike price times number of contracts. This does not really make sense to me but that's how I understand things.

Going further, help walk me through a couple of examples. There are components of the process that are still fuzzy for me..

Say I buy one call option with a strike price of $250 and the contract is $1. Purchasing one of these contracts is therefore $100: I am paying $100 as a sort of down payment for the right, but not the obligation, to exercise the contract which would enable me to buy 100 shares of this stock at $250. So, if the stock goes up to $280 before the contract expires, I have the ability to exercise and pay $25,000 for 100 shares the stock instead of paying $28,000. 

So, what if I do not want to exercise the contract and just want to sell it back to the market (because I may not have $25,000 but still want to make a profit). So say that the stock does go up to $280 before the contract expires, which in turn will raise the value of the contract and where I would expect to make a return. I am not sure how much I would make if this was the case, but say I do sell it back to the market.

What I understand is that with the sale of this contract there is someone buying it. Now, if the buyer of the contract I just sold decides to exercise it, that means that I would be assigned, correct? And being assigned the contract means that I would then owe the buyer $25,000?? If I bought the contract for $1 and it goes up to what, $3, that means that by selling it back to the market I would make a profit of $200. So I'd then owe some person $24,800. Why ever sell a contract?? But this can't be how it works...

What am I missing here?

Thanks.";121779;Rookie trying to understand assignment in options trading (have not bought and don't plan to purchase options for a while until I get a good understanding on things).;

As earnings season continues, one thing is becoming clear: tech is king.

Coming into Q1 releases, conventional wisdom was that sectors such as energy and financials would be the big winners. Tech, on the other hand, had largely led the moves down over the last couple of months, and was not often mentioned as a place to be. Energy earnings are, as expected, showing tremendous growth, which is hardly surprising if you so much as glance at a chart showing oil prices, while early in the season most financial firms did reveal the expected increase in trading profits.

The headline grabbers, however, have been in tech, and especially big tech.

The big four, Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOGL), collectively known as the FANG stocks, have all reported EPS beats, ranging from a penny in the case of Netflix to a massive 168% upside surprise from Amazon. Now that we have all their earnings, it is time to take stock, if you’ll forgive the pun.

Yet the bull run has slowed considerably, especially in 2016. Stocks started the year with a scary plunge that was fueled by fears of a new global recession and worries about the downsides of cheap oil. Some even feared the bull market was near its death bed.

""The more fun part of the bull market is probably over,"" said Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock. ""It doesn't mean stocks can't advance. But the gains are going to be more muted -- and accompanied by more volatility."" 

 Still, the market freakout of 2016 highlights the serious challenges facing the bull market as it grows older.

After soaring 30% in 2013 and 11% the next year, the S&amp;P 500 was basically flat in 2015. Not only has the market stopped smashing records, it's down 7% from its May all-time highs.

Seven may not sound very old, but in stock-market years it's practically senior-citizen status. Only two bulls have lived longer, led by the nine-year run that ended in March 2000.

""Time to buy the bull an AARP membership,"" jokes Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indexes.

In some ways, this bull market anniversary should carry an asterisk. That's because the record books may actually need to be amended if a bear market (20% decline from previous highs) happens soon.

hioim;1527775202;8nimlm;;30;;151;"Section 1 – What does a stock trader actually do

The life of a trader is often glamorised by films such as The Wolf of Wallstreet and Margin Call – a view that is shared by many who have no direct experience with the wider investment industry. It is also true that different types of traders have very different workloads. Trading emerging markets is not the same as trading FTSE stocks or the forex markets.

Let’s start by defining what traders, broadly speaking actually are:

“Professionals in finance who buy and/or sell assets on the financial markets.”

A day in the life of a trader: Behind the scenes

These are people who usually have a background in finance, either through traditional education \(think degrees in finance, accounting, economics, investment management etc\) or through practical experience at companies working within financial services.

This is to say that the day\-to\-day activities of a trader is to either buy assets \(such as stocks, futures, commodities\) or to sell assets \(such as stocks, forex, bonds\). Two distinct roles in trading can be summed up in the Buy side, and the Sell side in terms of execution.

A broader categorisation would include participants within the financial markets who trade securities. This encompasses independent traders working from home to large multinational financial institutions which see billions of dollars a day flow from and to their order books.

The Buy Side

The Buy side is concerned with purchasing assets, and this generally involves taking orders from management or clients and then sending those orders to the broker to be executed. This role is being gradually replaced by technology, specifically automation and AI, and its hard to see a future for buy side traders 20 years from now. There is also a distinctly bad reputation associated with buy side traders, these are often just messengers, and have been known to treat brokers with incredible hostility and bitterness over recent years.

The Sell Side

Alternatively, the Sell side is just the opposite – these traders are only concerned with selling positions either the firm or the firms clients holds. Again technology is eliminating this role over time, and today both buy and sell side traders simply take message, and pass it along either electronically through an online platform or via telephone for the perhaps more traditional establishments.

Private Hedge fund managers

Many successful traders have gone on to start hedge funds with private companies and from private investors. This is a highly privileged position to be in, as hedge fund managers are in control of both the broad strategy for the investments and receives the greatest compensation should the strategy be profitable.

Private Portfolio Managers

Portfolio managers working at a private company \(such as a large hedge fund\) is again a much sought after position. Portfolio managers generally create a positive or negative selection portfolio, which allows them to implement their own strategy to make the best returns with the lease risk – although these parameters are often set outside the control of the individual portfolio manager. The same also exists within commercial banking, but it is usually more focused on creating a very balanced portfolio that exists to hedge risk as opposed to making real returns.

Analysts

Analysts do the number crunching and quantitative prep work for the portfolio or hedge fund managers. This role involves applied finance and taking a close look at various assets fundamentals. This includes the balance sheet, income statement and cashflow statement for analysts looking at stocks. This is usually a relatively junior role, and those who are successful here tend to become traders, portfolio managers and eventually hedge fund managers over the course of a successful career.

Investment Banking

There are still plenty of traders left at investment banks, despite the decline over the last few decades. As much as 90&amp;#37; of the time is spent dealing with clients such as Hedge and Pension Funds.

Investment Bank Traders

As much as 90&amp;#37; of the time is spent dealing with clients such as Hedge and Pension Funds. 

The trader is then Making Markets in Assets the clients want to buy/sell, such as stocks, currencies, commodities and bonds.

The other 10&amp;#37; of time is Proprietary trading, utilising the banks large balance sheet to create a positive selection portfolio.

Market Makers \(Agency\)

Market making is the primary task of an investment trader \(\~80&amp;#37; of market making business\) 

Split into two sections:

Agency Business – Client holds risk

Risk business – Investment Bank holds risk

Investment Bank charges commission on these activities at a typical rate of 5 basis points or 0.05&amp;#37;

Example – Buy £10,000,000 of BP stock at £100 per share = 100,000 BP shares.

Commission for bank \- £10,000,000 X 0.005 = £5,000

Risk free for bank – algorithm executes trades based on client orders

In terms of basis points, 100 = 1&amp;#37;

Proprietary Trading

This type of trading can happen in two ways, the first where small investors at home use their own capital to trade for a direct gain or commercially where a firm uses its own capital to make trades to be the prime beneficially of the rewards should the trade go well. This is in contrast to how hedge funds would normally just earn a commission, by also utilising internal capital the firm is able to take larger risks, which tend to come with the larger rewards.

Here’s another interesting fact:

“Only 6&amp;#37; of candidates end up making it as a professional trader” \(Business Insider, 2011\)

This statement alone shows just how competitive the industry is, and to make a successful career is even harder, with only \~5&amp;#37; of traders ever making it to a managerial level.

A day in the life of a trader: Behind the scenes

Section 2 – How does 8 hours day break down?

6:00 AM

Traders usually start the day at 6.30 AM and start to catch up on news that broke overnight that may A\) affect current positions or B\) provide opportunities for new positions. These changes are digested, and areas of special interest are noted for further analysis later. 

7:00 AM

Arrive at trading floor at 7:30, 30 minutes before markets open. This is the time where traders prepare themselves for the day. It also serves as an opportunity to talk to colleagues. For most hedge funds and other long\-term traders, team meetings will happen in the morning to ensure all traders are up to speed and playing from the same game plan. 

8:00 AM

Markets open: based on overnight news there may be buying / selling activity to adjust the traders portfolio based on the latest information. Many traders prefer not to trade at the market open due to higher volatility as traders from around the world react to overnight news. 

9:00 AM

A common task around 9:00 AM would be to scan the market for short term opportunities, or to catch up on fundamental company analysis of companies in the watch list. 

10:00 AM

Continuation of analysis or opportunity seeking based on the traders own intuition, experience and judgement. This is also prime time for internal meetings with the team and meetings with clients, potential clients etc. 

11:00 AM

Here we see lower volume and volatility, and so short\-term opportunities diminish, traders are thinking about lunch at this point. Finishing up financial models and analysis done in the morning. Another prime time for meetings with the team and clients. 

12:00 PM

Most long\-term traders take lunch, some short\-term traders will stay at the desk as timing can be critical to a successful day. 

1:00 PM

As investment banks and other major institutions return from lunch volatility in the markets increases and short\-term traders get back to work. Long\-term traders generally get back to analysis, risk management or strategy functions with only a cursory interest in the current market prices and volatility. 

2:00 PM

Day traders will spend this time monitoring positions and executing trades as necessary. Long\-term traders use this period in a variety of ways, as mentioned above. 

3:00 PM

Short\-term traders now think about closing existing positions and stop looking for new opportunities. This is also where the administrative functions of cancelling unfilled orders, or for long term traders, finalising analysis of the day and presenting it to stakeholders. This is the last chance to exit positions for the trading day. 

4:00 PM

The markets are now closed. Traders often look back at the day, seeing what went well \(and what didn’t\). Management will often check in and with\-it bureaucracy and paperwork. 

5:00 PM

Time to leave the office and go home. The advent of mobile internet means most traders are now reading the latest financial news, following commentary and thinking about the strategy for tomorrow. 

6:00 PM

If all went well arrive home, if not then its likely the trader will still be at the office working to meet the deadline of the day, from financial models to briefing management and clients. 

7:00 PM

Outside of the general workday, traders will spend much of the evening doing research and analysis – everything from learning about the markets to experimenting with financial models to taking an advanced excel course. 

Section 3 – Why you might want to be a stock trader

We meet a lot of traders, its what we do – and here are a few of the top reasons traders we spoke to continue to do what they do.

Love the Game 

Many traders are extremely fond of the game that is the financial markets. Day traders talk about the rush as fast\-paced action that runs from 8am to 4pm 5 days a week. The same holds true for long\-term traders, and while lacking the constant adrenaline of day trading the highs of closing a trade that’s been on\-going for months is just as great a feeling – the analogy one trader used was whereas day traders get Christmas every day, long\-term traders get all of their Christmases at once, 4\-5 times a year.

Financial Freedom 

This is not just about the ability to make a living from trading and the financial markets, but from having the knowledge and understanding of the world of finance to make sound financial decisions, whether that be in deciding between a fixed or variable mortgage, or the best ways to allocate capital to save for school fees.

Intellectual Challenge 

There is undoubtedly both an intellectual and an emotional challenge in trading successfully. While it is said that day traders trade emotion, long term portfolio managers trade on intellect and sound financial decision making.

Style &amp; Expression 

Traders all trade differently, from value investors to crypto speculators each trader develops a style and method of trading that fits their way of life and the perception they have of the world around them. If you are emotional in\-tune with the wider world, then day trading can be exceptionally profitable. The same holds true for value investors like Warren Buffet, a trader who enjoys digesting and analysing reams of company reports to find what Buffet calls “Great companies at fair prices”.

Three years ago, Facebook Inc. was the dominant social media site among U.S. teens, visited by 71 percent of people in that magic, trendsetting demographic. Not anymore. 

Now, only 51 percent of kids between 13 and 17 use Facebook, according to Pew Research Center. The world’s largest social network has finally been eclipsed in popularity by YouTube, Snapchat and Facebook\-owned Instagram. 

“The social media environment today revolves less around a single platform than it did three years ago,” the researchers wrote in a survey published Thursday. Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube is the most popular, used by 85 percent of teens, according to Pew.

The U.S. is by far Facebook’s most lucrative advertising market, where it makes a staggering $23.59 in quarterly revenue per user. But that doesn’t mean growth can continue forever.

I have a ira and a mutual fund, which make up the major majority of my investments.

I usually throw a hundred or so in here or there. Adds up to maybe a couple hundred a month, while still adding to my ira and other accounts monthly automatically through direct deposits. So all that in mind. Does it make more sense, in this market, with my robinhood account, to just keep buying slowly a little here and there like I have, or just hold cash for the time being a wait for the bear market and try and take advantage of having more cash on hand to buy the dip?

Hi traders!

A couple of things I want to hit on and get your feedback about:

1\) Welcome new arrivals! It is great to have you join us here at r/Stockmarket, we are a fast growing financial subreddit! Feel free to ask questions about stocks, trading and more!

2\) WE NEED MORE MODS!

This sub has been growing fast, and a few of the older mods are burned out, so it is time to bring in some fresh blood! There are a few requirements to being a mod here, besides the perks like a company car and your own 19yr old personal assistant from Sweden \(male or female, tell us your preference. Actually no, we get to choose for you, its funnier that way\). 

We are looking for mods that are active on this subreddit during market hours. Your duties will include the normal clean up of lazy posts and spam, but also to guide conversations and new traders get the answers they are looking for.

You need to be logged into our discord and will be given access to the mod chat area where you are expect to keep in touch with your fellow mods and be able to chat over voice when needed. The mod area in discord will cover both this subreddit and the live chat, but it is not your duty to monitor live chat. 

2.1\) As a mod you are also responsible for bringing important breaking news and what even the stock flavor of the day is to the subreddit for discussion. For example, today LULU is \+10&amp;#37;, why is that? Is there an opportunity to fade that trade? Lets discuss!

3\) For the love of Musk, we have our own chat room right here [https://discord.gg/0Th8ZTRxPUqeAq71](https://discord.gg/0Th8ZTRxPUqeAq71)

The next time somebody asks if anybody else wants to join the chat room they just made because they just discovered discord yesterday, they get banned and every single person jumping into that thread to start spamming they own crappy chat room gets banned too.

Reason being is that there are way too many people running scams that feed off the uninitiated. 

The discord stockmarket/investing chat linked above is shared with r/investing and has some really great people in there. If you are an active trader and prefer live chat, please visit the above. If you are interested in helping bring content to the live chat and being a mod there, we are also happy to discuss that.

4\) This is longer term, but I think its worth bringing up again. I wanted to test the waters with a youtube channel that will discuss the news and events that pop up on this and the investing subreddit. We could do podcasts where we interview the active traders in here, and perhaps bring on some special guests. Thoughts?

Thanks for your time, now go short LULU because that shit is overdone. ";122694;ITS TIME... TO MAKE R/STOCKMARKET GREAT AGAIN!;

Direct\-to\-consumer  revenue, which includes online sales, rose 62 percent in the first  quarter, helping the company record a profit of 55 cents per share.  Analysts were expecting a profit of 46 cents, according to Thomson  Reuters I/B/E/S.

At least nine brokerages raised their price target on Lululemon's stock, with Barclays being the most bullish.

The  brokerage raised its price target by $50 to $150, saying they were  ""hard\-pressed to find anything negative"" in first\-quarter numbers.";122700;LULU gaping up +10% and new 52wk highs;

A couple of things I want to hit on and get your feedback about:

1\) Welcome new arrivals! It is great to have you join us here at r/Stockmarket, we are a fast growing financial subreddit! Feel free to ask questions about stocks, trading and more!

**2\) WE NEED MORE MODS!**

This sub has been growing fast, and a few of the older mods are burned out, so it is time to bring in some fresh blood! There are a few requirements to being a mod here, besides the perks like a company car and your own 19yr old personal assistant from Sweden \(male or female, tell us your preference. Actually no, we get to choose for you, its funnier that way\).

We are looking for mods that are active on this subreddit during market hours. Your duties will include the normal clean up of lazy posts and spam, but also to guide conversations and new traders get the answers they are looking for.

You need to be logged into our discord and will be given access to the mod chat area where you are expect to keep in touch with your fellow mods and be able to chat over voice when needed. The mod area in discord will cover both this subreddit and the live chat, but it is not your duty to monitor live chat.

2.1\) As a mod you are also responsible for bringing important breaking news and what even the stock flavor of the day is to the subreddit for discussion. For example, today LULU is \+10&amp;#37;, why is that? Is there an opportunity to fade that trade? Lets discuss!

3\) For the love of Elon Musk, we have our own chat room right here [https://discord.gg/0Th8ZTRxPUqeAq71](https://discord.gg/0Th8ZTRxPUqeAq71)

We see a lot of people asking about chat rooms every week. Sometimes the person asking is doing so as a set up so that the persons buddy can come in and advertise their own chatroom.

Many times these chat rooms can be shady and looking to scam you, other times they are just a few friends hanging out. We do not have the time or resources to go investigate these things, so please, no linking discord chat rooms, doing so gets you banned.

The discord  linked above is shared with r/investing and has some really great people in there. If you are an active trader and prefer live chat, please visit the above. If you are interested in helping bring content to the live chat and being a mod there, we are also happy to discuss that.

**Whats next?**

We are looking to get more active with individuals making podcasts, live Q&amp;A streams and more, stay tuned, and as always, thank you for helping improve this sub!

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

togetherinbed;1528078305;8odq3i;;4;;5;"So you decided to come back after all those fees. Today is going to be about 401k if you haven't guessed from the title of the post. Alright, don't jump ahead of me; I know there are other retirement funds, I'll get to them. I'm not going to get into everything in 1 post cause reddit readers have such a short attention span. YES YOU!

What is a 401k?

Basically its a form of retirement plan that your employer can offer to you \(GET A FKING JOB\). 401k is offered by your company so obviously they are limited in things they offer. Mine only gives me mutual funds. Why the fk do we want to put money into a 401k if they are limiting my choices of investment? Because most companies offer a contribution match. This is basically free money, unless you're retarded \(Stop reading and go die\).

So from my last post I talked about tax this tax that etc. A 401k retirement fund is actually TAXLESS! OMG!\(DON'T JUMP THE GUN\) they are however NOT FEE\-LESS! Calm down I'll explain everything. So the way a 401k works is by taking a &amp;#37; of your income of your choosing. This means that this money does not get taxed before you invest \(winning already \+ &amp;#37; company match\). However, those mutual funds/ ETF\(exchanged traded fund\)/stock that your company offers sometimes have fee's and they do add up if you choose to diversify. 

How to utilize your 401k properly?

If your stuck from the paragraphs above let me explain. So lets say you make 40k a year putting you in the bracket of 25&amp;#37; tax. You can trick\(defer taxes\) the system into making you make 30k if you put 10k into your 401k fund. This way you can pay less taxes and still save for retirement. \*\*READ BOTTOM FOR ADVANCE INFORMATION\*\*

So now I taught you how to defer taxes and pay less taxes on your income tax. As always I give you the catch to every situation! The limits of a 401k are as follows, you are only allowed to put in the max of 18.5k per year excluding your employer match. You will be taxed heavily if you decide to take the money out before 59.5 years old. SO DON'T TOUCH THIS UNLESS YOU REALLY NEED TO! \(I will not be going into RMD if your already that old, you should know your shit\) You can however take the money out for SPECIAL REASONS such as: Medical bills, Disaster Relief, First Time Home Buyer, 401k Loan, Education \(Will edit in more\)

\*\*Secret tax info: THIS IS HOW REAL TAX WORKS IN THE US. if you make 40k a year, you are taxed slowly up the ladder. so you will get taxed 10&amp;#37; of the 7,550$, then 15&amp;#37; of 23,100$, then 9,350 at 25&amp;#37; \( 7500\+ 23100\+ 9350 = 40k\) its not a full 25&amp;#37; at 40,000. So for this person making 40k a year, as long as they can live with 30650 a year and puts 9350$ into their 401k, they will only get taxed up to the 15&amp;#37; bracket. This is how you beat the system. \*\*

On the next episode, it will be about ROTH Long term investment. Also stay tuned cause I will be giving a comprehensive outlook on what to do depending on your needs/income at the end of the LONG TERM INVESTMENT!

[Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US) introduced features to help iPhone users put down their phones \-\- at least temporarily \-\- after criticism people were addicted to the company’s flagship device and following similar moves to combat smartphone addiction by competitors.

The slew of tools includes updates to “Do Not Disturb” and new ways to manage notifications. Instead of waking up to a string of notifications missed over night, users will get a new “Good morning” screen summarizing the alerts. There’s also a larger array of controls for muting notifications and grouping alerts to reduce the number sent to a user.

The most notable enhancement is called “Screen Time,” an activity report showing how much time you’re spending inside of individual apps, how often you pick up your phone and which apps are sending you the most notifications. People can set time limits on specific apps and get alerts reminding them to stop using that software as the limit approaches. It then shuts the app off, until users change the setting, executive Craig Federighi said Monday on stage at Apple’s annual developers conference. The time\-limits feature will synchronize between multiple devices via Apple’s iCloud service.";123387;Apple Announces Slew of New Anti-Addiction iPhone Controls;

lykosen11;1528228581;8otywg;;56;;273;"**Hello! Welcome to /r/StockMarket**

Welcome to the fantastic world of investing where there is infinite to learn and infinite to go. The problem with giving advice on finance is that there is not a proven system that works. You need to find what works for you and work with that. First of all, I would recommend searching around on the financial subreddits for new people posts and reading them. The question has been asked thousands of times, and there are tons of amazing answers. Otherwise, here is my short-take.

In finance you need to read. That is how you learn, how you get information, how you find out new developments in the market. All of the information. Books, news, financial statements, press releases and earning calls. Read everything. You will find hundreds of words you don’t understand, so look them up (investopedia has a majority of them). In the beginning you will struggle, however, as time goes by, you will start to understand. If you do not like reading, learn to like it. There is no way around this. If you find yourself investing without reading tons, you are going to lose.

**Reading**  
I recommend reading the 10Q document (hard), conference call transcript (easier) and the shareholders presentation (easiest) of your favorite public corporation. You can find it on their respective investor relations page. Other than that, without exception, anyone attempting to understand the huge complex thing called the stock market, I heavily recommend reading “One up on Wall Street” by Peter Lynch. It is a true masterpiece, and it is very easy for a newbie to read. Enjoyable, teaching and fantastic. After that I recommend The little book on common Sense Investing by John Bogle (best book on funds) and the intelligent investor by Ben Graham (“thick” but king. People like recommending it as the first book, but I think they are stupid).

**Doing**  
Then after you have started learning, it is time to start doing. As you start out, you should consider two things. Indexing or stock picking. 90% of people should own indexes, but people truly interested should look to specific stocks. 

**Exchange Traded Funds**  
These are ETFs like $VOO, $VTI, $VWO and $VOOG,  and is a way to take on the least amount of risk while still gaining along with the market. You get a wide basket of stocks, focusing on things like the S&amp;P500 ($VOO), which is an index of large (minimum 6.1 billion USD) US companies. Historically, you can expect 7% annual gain here on average (some years might be up much more, or even in the red). That’s realistic. Anything offering much more than that without risk has tons of risk without disclosing it, per definition. $VOOG indexes growth companies, focusing less on the giants and more on the up and coming. $VWO focuses on emerging markets, getting places like brazil, russia and all over asia. Indexing is by far the best choice, and will very often gain you a steady growth. If you disagree with this you must get John Bogles take on it, the founder and former CEO of Vanguard. Best way to do this is in the book recommended above. The final and great choice is $VTI, which is the global basket which contains the market as a whole. It will never be a mistake, even if performance may vary.


**Stocks**  
Buying individual companies through common stock is much harder, and the process is really tough. To put yourself into that, you need to be ready to put in some serious work, and the process is much more complicated than I could explain here. Here is a Due Diligence (DD for short) checklist to evaluate a company. That said, it is simplified to the point of worthlessness really, while being a start. Before you make a decision if you should own a company or not, you must know these things:

* What does the company do?    
How do they earn money from that?  
What is the edge or competitive advantage of the company?    
What prevents someone else to just out-compete them by spending more money?    


* How are they priced now?    
What does their stock costs, and what does that make their valuation (Stock price * Number of shares = Market cap (company market value))  
What does that market value imply?   
If they are high priced, high growth &amp; returns are expected. Is it likely that they will complete that or even do better? This is what would move the stock price.  

* What are the company's competitors?  
 What makes this company a better pick than the competitors?  

* Understand their balance sheet!  
 What is their net cash?   
How leveraged are they?  
Is inventory increasing or decreasing (inventory increasing faster than sales is a horrible sign)?  
   How solvent are they?   
What's their book value?  
What do these numbers actually imply about the company?   

* Think about growth and developments!
How does their best case scenario look?
 Same for bad scenario, good scenario, worst case scenario and realistic scenario. How likely would you say each scenario is? Try to find facts to back your hypothesis up!


**Questionaire**

Lastly, and honestly most importantly, here is a list of things you should ALWAYS be able to answer before buying a security, equity or derivative:

* Why am I getting this instead of an index? Where is the upside?  
* If the stock goes up, what action do I take? When do I sell? At what price or % gain.  
* If the stock goes down, when do I sell? At what % loss or a price.  
* What risks are there? How does the worst case realistic scenario look like?  
* Why am I making this investment right now? Is there a better time?  
* What exactly am I buying?   

And finally, always, without exception, perform your own due diligence. Don’t take advice from other people without understanding the situation yourself. I never give advice what to do, I make it a rule to just spread my viewpoint &amp; strategy. If you have to ask questions, you should not own the equity. Ask about what you do not own. If you have to ask questions about an equity you already own, you have messed up. Try to not mess up again.

**Oh.** Remember, you will get cocky. You will get greedy. We all do. Everyone thinks they can do it all and make the cash rain. WHEN that happens (not if), make sure you follow your system, because without the system, you will lose over time.

On paper, [Autodesk Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ADSK:US) is a bit of a mess. It’s been losing money for almost three years, and its book value \-\- what’s left if you sell off the assets and repay debt \-\- is negative. Yet over the past year, the stock has gained 23 percent, almost double the S&amp;P 500.

BullsToBears;1528347914;8p7lzl;;0;;1;"It has now been 15 months since Donald Trump became president. We knew better yet, contrary to what most “experts” believed, as soon as he took office, the stock market exploded. The upward movement was, without debate, record setting. Every American with a 401K applauded and everyone was happy! Or were they? Professional Stock traders like us have a bit of a different view. With an extremely fast one sided move higher, it was still difficult for investors to have made significant amounts of money. Why? Most traders tend to do better in volatile choppy markets, with swings up and down, just like the one we are in now. So, If you feel like the road to becoming a successful trader is like a roller coaster ride of ups and downs you're not alone.  If you have been following the market as of late (we are referencing to the Dow Industrials for an understandable point of reference) you will have noticed that volatility has been re\-introduced into the market. The current swings are considered by some to be “big” although you should consider that the Dow in much higher than it was just 12\- 18 months ago and ""percentage wise"" these swings are not as big as they may appear. Any great trader will tell you, these big swings up and down are your greatest friend and not your enemy.  We say this realizing though that if you manage to be on the wrong side of one of these big down swings, it could be a bad situation for you monetarily. This is where being a student of the stock market is extremely important. You must get into the movement of the market much like a hitter in baseball. A great hitter studies the pitcher he is facing. Not just when he’s up, but with every batter that steps to the plate. A great hitter starts to time the pitcher, he starts to feel the rhythm of the pitcher. He notices the pitch selection. He notices what the pitcher usually does on a 3\-2 count. He notices if the pitcher is throwing first pitch for strikes or testing the batters with balls on the first pitch. The best hitters in baseball history are those who not only hold the all\-time hitting records, but changed the game as we know it. They are uncoincidentially among the greatest baseball players of all time.  Not just being in the market but understanding it are parallel. By continually keeping your pulse on the market you begin to identify the ebb and flow and eventually making money through trading becomes easier and more predictable. When that happens and you have swings like we are seeing NOW in the current market, you can make large amounts of money. Your job is to see the market as a great hitter does! Don’t only look at your trades. Do some paper trading. Look at various sectors to see how they are acting in different market conditions. Look at other types of sector securities and see what they are doing. What is gold doing while the market is having a down trend? What are the bonds yields telling you by what they are doing?  If you truly become a student of the market, the opportunities for you to make money will jump right out at you. If you don’t, trading will remain like gambling. Gambling is not a long\-term wealth strategy. Remember you don’t just want to make great trades, your main goal is to become a great trader. Being a great trader is about developing certain mental qualities. It is the process of constantly pushing yourself to grow stronger and better. A profitable trader is not necessarily a good trader. Likewise, a good trader is also not necessarily a profitable one, yet a good trader ultimately finds himself with a much higher probability of being profitable and finding success in the long run.  In conclusion \- we are still in a bull market! Just more choppy and much better for traders.

Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon are doubling down on their plea for corporations to stop providing quarterly earnings guidance.

Buffett, who runs [Berkshire Hathaway Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BRK%2FA:US), and Dimon, [JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US)’s chief executive officer, said in a joint Wall Street Journal editorial that they are encouraging all public companies to consider moving away the practice, arguing that it can stifle long\-term investments.

“Quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short\-term profits at the expense of long\-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” they said.

The two men are among the financial industry’s most powerful leaders. They have said the practice of telling Wall Street what to expect from earnings can distort management’s priorities. In the latest appeal, they said companies often hesitate to spend on technology, hiring, and research and development to meet quarterly earnings forecasts that can be affected by seasonal factors beyond their control.";124144;This is what public markets need!!! - Dimon, Buffett Urge CEOs to End Quarterly Earnings Forecasts;

hibbert0604;1528459653;8pjcoz;;2;;0;I have a friend who works in finance and his firm was really high on them. We discussed in vesting on Tuesday and early Wednesday. I was a bit weary because of the 50% drop over the last 6 months. But it appeared have bottomed out. However I decided to play it safe and wait for a little more confirmation that a reversal was in place. Well, on Wednesday it bolted up 10%, at which point I bought in at 21. Yesterday it surged an additional 20%, red market be damned. Their financials look solid, and I'm pretty optimistic about their future.

sisumoney;1528463511;8pjrh4;;10;;4;"(CNBC) Apple's orders for new iPhone parts may fall 20 percent from last year for the year's first half, according to Japan's Nikkei news service. Sources tell Nikkei that Apple is being conservative with its orders.

From a different perspective, I think we should all take a step back. We can't expect Apple to continue to sell as many IPhones as it once did. I do believe that Humans world-wide will continue to have Apple products in their hands and homes decades from now.

But today, the products Apple is putting out now are ones that do not need to be replaced every year. I, myself, have had my iPhone for over 4 years with little problems. To me, this decrease in supply orders doesn't scare me. People do not have to replace their products every year. But overall, I dont see a move away from Apple products anytime soon. 

I do not think this is a top and do belive Apple will be the first compnay to reach a Trillion dollar market cap. Let me remind you it's net income is double the closest competitor.

* Google backs down from a DoD contract after backlash from employees, demonstrating the power of scarce tech talent. This may have led to a congressional investigation into Alphabet’s dealings with Huawei.
* MU is being investigated by Chinese authorities, likely another sign of increasing trade tension between China and the US.

sisumoney;1528555135;8pt72y;;27;;53;"After the 5% move upward yesterday, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at the companies fundimentals to see if they are currently undervalued. 

Right off the bat, they have a pretty hight gross margin showing they have some nice pricing power. I mean other than Red-Bull they have no other serious competition. Along with the large gross margins, they have been increasing revenue for the past 10 years. Always nice to see. 

When it comes to the key ratios they show some pretty stellar numbers. Large ROE, big net margins, and NO DEBT.

Overall though, the price is pretty high right now. We are looking at a P/E of 35 and trading on the larger side of my opinion when it came to their inrinsic value. I believe there is something interesting here but until it comes on sale, I will be staying away.

sisumoney;1528643737;8q1fjr;;20;;21;"After walking into the ULTA with my girlfriend yesterday, I was blown away at the operation they have going on there. There was a lot of people and I saw it as a possible investing opportunity. So, I went home and looked up the financials. 

First off I am always a little standoffish about retial stores. And although they have an online presence, they are moslty situated in shopping malls and centers. So that always makes me a little worrisome. Now, if they partnered with Amazon, could be a whole different story. 

Ulta is interesting because they have signs of, from what I can see, great capital allocation. Large ROE, No dividend (which acceptable with consistanly large ROEs), and No Debt! 

But they do have the margins of a retial store. The gross margins are below 40%, which is the level I like to see. And their net margins are below 10%. 

Overall, I like what they are doing capital wise but the margins and the over looming storm cloud of the retial bug will keep me away for now. 

How about you? ";124706;A Closer Look at Ulta, There Might Be Potential;
badpauly;1528665068;8q3wya;;36;;297;"I've posted this hedge fund report a few times in the past but it has never received much love. In contrast, the weekly insider report I post seems to get pretty good attention.

What a lot of people probably don't realize is that hedge fund activity is probably *more* predictive of future returns than insider activity. The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money. In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

I'll post this report once again to see if anybody finds it interesting.

* Amazon (AMZN) will expand its Whole Foods Market discounts for Prime customers to 10 new states including Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. The expansion means the discounts will be available to nearly half the country. (CNBC)
* Fitbit (FIT) launched its new fitness tracker, Fitbit Ace, for children 8 years old and up. While a device for children will open up Fitbit to an entirely new group of potential users, it is not enough on its own to help Fitbit completely reverse its losses. (CNBC)

Historically, crude oil prices and the S&amp;P 500 index have influenced each other. Crude oil (USO) prices have been falling since June 2014. The correlation of the S&amp;P 500 index and crude oil was highest when crude fell below $30, and lowest when crude oil was at around $100.

Oil is an important driver of the world economy. Energy demand constitutes a significant portion of US consumer spending. Equities and crude oil move in a cycle. A sudden rise in prices pressurizes consumer spending and strains economic growth in consuming nations. On the other hand, a sudden fall in crude oil prices could indicate a slowdown in economic activity. Plus, a sharp drop in crude oil prices could affect other industries that support it, employment in the sector, and the financial sector that lends to it.

Do you think this correlation between S&amp;P 500 sales growth and the oil price will continue for many years in the future?";125416;"S&amp;P 500 sales growth vs. oil price: year 2010 - 2018";

MP8877;1528987916;8r2ge1;;6;;3;"Forgive me, I am new to options and am enjoying everything I'mlearning. But, I think it goes without saying, I still have much to learn.

Are there ever scenarios where someone would buy a call option that is very close to expiring, then exercise the contract immediately (if the premium + strike price = lower than current stock price)?
Or is it against some kind of regulation or rule?

Strike price: $5.00

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

Beside from the Trump administration clowning around with ZTE and China tariffs, the biggest news this week is the approval of the AT&amp;T’s acquisition of Time Warner, which has broad implications for the market. The media was flooded with opinions on what this deal means. Columbia law professor, Tim Wu, published an article on the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/opinion/time-warner-att-merger.html) arguing that the deal approval “implicitly encourages the rest of the industry to integrate as well” and increases the risk of “leaving a fully integrated industry immune to new competition” — in other words, this would be great for media investors. However, legendary media investor John Malone [questions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/media-mogul-john-malone-questions-mergers-of-apples-and-oranges-1529017642?mod=hp_major_pos15) the wisdom of vertical integration, “If you are just forming a conglomerate by putting everything in the same bucket, it eliminates your flexibility, you’ve got tax problems, regulatory problems and a lot of problems that these companies operating autonomously don’t have.” But the most important opinion comes from AT&amp;T CEO, Randall Stephenson, who sat down with CNBC after the approval was announced: [watch it here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Z9pIVWKRw)

One of the drivers of the AT&amp;T / Time Warner deal is the increasing dominance tech giants — Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Netflix et. al — whose rise caught most off guard. WSJ [put out a piece](https://www.wsj.com/articles/behemoths-have-dominated-the-market-before-but-tech-is-different-1528997537) demonstrating that large company dominance, as measured by market capitalization, has been greater in the past. I found the piece insightful, but I have several push backs. First, excluding the dot-com bubble, concentration has reached a 30-year plus high, and growing. Unlike the dot-com era, these tech giants are actually putting others out of business while continuing to grow rapidly. Second, the tech giants today —  Apple, Microsoft Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook — employ far fewer people per $ of profit generated than giants of the past, so the concentration of wealth and power is understated. For example, in the year 2000, GE, Walmart, and Exxon Mobile were among the top 5.  Below is a chart from the WSJ article...

I am going to do a larger degree overview of the DXY, since I have not done one in while, and I have been getting a number of questions about it of late.  So, if you are following along, please take a look at the attached monthly chart, as I go through the progression of where I think we are in the larger degree time frames.

Back in 2011, we correctly saw the impending multi-year rally developing in the DXY, whereas most others were looking for the dollar to crash.  In fact, our target was 103.53, the 1.618 extension from the 73 region, which we exceeded by 29 cents before the market turned back down.  And, to put this market call into context, many of you may remember the certainty within the market that the dollar was going to crash due to all the QE thrown at it.  Yet, the exact opposite occurred, which clearly surprised most of the market . . . well . . . at least those who were not reading our analysis.

Initially, I had expected the turn down in the DXY from 103.53 to be a 4th wave, which would hold support at the 91.70 region, the 1.00 extension and common target for a 4th wave. However, when we exceeded that support to the downside, we then overlapped into what I was initially counting as wave 1 off the 2008 lows (now labeled as an a-wave), which then invalidated the standard impulsive structure I was tracking since that time.  This caused me to re-assess the entire structure since 2008, which has me viewing the larger structure now as a corrective rally into 103.82.

But, as we know, corrective structures are much more variable than impulsive structures.  They take many unexpected twists and turns as they eventually head to their targets.  In our case, I still think that target is much lower, and potentially in the 80 region next.  Yet, the question is what path will the market take to get down to the 80 region next. 

While there are several ways to count the micro structure on the smaller degree time frames, I think the monthly chart does suggest we are approaching not only trend line resistance, but also larger degree Fibonacci resistance.  But, until we actually break down below the low struck this past week at 93.19, it is certainly possible that the DXY may attempt to extend as high as the 98/99 region before we set up for an appreciable turn down.

So, I will be looking for clues in the coming week as to whether we are indeed going to see an extension in this 5th wave, as presented in yellow on the 21 minute chart, or indications that the market has begun an impulsive decline to the 80 region.

https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/images/charts/201806/full-cb0fcdfdcdb371fdd02243530a9d2db9802ac8c0.jpg

Now, I know there are some that are still viewing this larger degree monthly chart as more immediately bullish.  And, to do that, you would have to assume that the high we struck at 103.82 was actually the b-wave of wave (4) so that you do not have the overlap I mentioned before which would cause an invalidation of the larger degree impulsive structure.   However, to do so would suggest striking Fibonacci levels for wave degrees in a manner in which I have rarely seen occur.  Moreover, it would suggest proportions between the various waves which also rarely occur.  While it is certainly possible and I am keeping that potential in the back of my mind should it increase in probability, I don’t think it to be highly probable at this point in time based upon historic patterns I have tracked through my experience with Fibonacci Pinball.

Lastly, I want to make one more important point about the dollar, and that is in relation to the metals market.  Most believe that if you know how the dollar is going to trade, you know how the metals will trade.  They assume it will be in lockstep in an inverse relationship.  I see that as complete poppycock, and want to show you an example of why I feel as I do.

If you simply glimpse at the monthly chart of the DXY I have presented with this inverse relationship in mind, you would have to assume that the large rally we have seen in the metals began when the DXY topped out at 103.82 and dropped precipitously to 88.25.  And, you would clearly be wrong.

https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/images/charts/201806/full-e49e319eb6d17c76598f7e3a4e3d0282829595a4.jpg

Rather, I have highlighted the segment of the DXY movement wherein we experienced one of the strongest rallies the metals have ever seen.  Is that really where you would expect it in relation to the DXY action?  In fact, you probably cannot find a more innocuous segment of market action within which you would expect the metals to see one of its strongest rallies in many, many years.  Moreover, the DXY was not even moving down the whole time when the metals were seeing their major rally. 

So, I would like to reiterate a point I have made many times.  You MUST analyze each chart on its own.  Moreover, if your analysis methodology is unable to accurately predict the movement of a particular chart (the great majority of the time) without needing to look at another market for guidance, I suggest you find yourself another methodology.  You see, correlations come and go, and unless you are able identify the point at which the seeming correlation will break, you are only setting yourself up for a potentially bad trade for which you will not likely understand the reason you took a large loss.  And, more often than not, it happens at a major inflection point for markets. 

Lastly, I want to remind you that, as we were coming into 2016, our analysis was pointing to an upcoming period of time wherein many old “correlations” would likely break down, as many of the charts we were following were looking for major trend changes.  In fact, among our predictions for early 2016 was an expectation for a rally in commodities, metals, US equities, bonds and emerging markets all coinciding.  So, not only were we able to identify the trend changes in each of the markets, we were able to even identify when the supposed “correlations” that many were following would break down.  Yet, notice how no one really discussed this break down in correlations.  In fact, it took a year until many in the market began to identify what we warned about a year earlier:  

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-01-20/morgan-stanley-we-havent-seen-shift-severe-over-decade

But, can you imagine the amount of losses created in the accounts owned by those expecting those correlations to continue to hold?  Not only did they not have the tools to understand what was happening, most continued to hold their losing positions because they were not able to recognize that what they were relying upon no longer worked.

During the longest bull market in modern history, the S&amp;P 500 surged a whopping 418% over the 9.5 years between November 1990 and March 2000.


This was during the famous economic expansion that took place during the Clinton era, in which job growth was robust, oil prices fell, stocks soared, and making money was as easy as throwing it in the stock market.


In mere months, this famed bull market may lose its title as the “longest” in the modern era.


That’s because, according to data and analysis from LDL Research, the current bull market will take over the claim to fame in late August 2018.

By looking at duration, total rate of return, and annualized rate of return, it really gives a sense of how these bull markets compare.

The current run, which will soon become the longest, didn’t have the same level of intensity as other high-ranking bull markets. Critics would say that it was artificially propped up by ultra-low rates, QE, and other government actions that will make the market ultimately less robust heading forward.

Regardless, the current run ranks in fourth place among the markets above in terms of annualized return.

What Ended Each Bull?

The market psychology behind bull and bear markets can be fascinating.

Below we look at the events credited with “ending” each bull market – though of course, it is actually the actions of investors (buying or selling) that ultimately dictates market direction.

1. The Great Expansion
The bull run lasted 9.5 years, ultimately capitulating when the Dotcom Bubble burst. From the span of June 1999 and May 2000, the Fed raised interest rates six times to try and get a “soft landing”. Market uncertainty was worsened by the 9/11 attacks that occurred the year after.

2. The Post-Crisis Bull Run
Still ongoing…

3. The Post-War Boom
This boom occurred after WWII, and it ended in 1956. Some of the sources we looked at credited the launch of Sputnik, Eisenhower’s heart attack, and the Hungarian Revolution as possible sources of market fear.

4. That ’70s Growth
The Iranian Revolution, the 1979 Energy Crisis, and the return of double-digit inflation were the factors blamed for the end of this bull.

5. Reagan Era
This bull market had the highest annualized return at 26.7%, but the party came to an end on Black Monday in 1987 – one of the most infamous market crashes ever. Some of the causes cited for the crash: program trading, overvaluation, illiquidity and market psychology.

6. The Hot Aughts
Stocks did decently well during the era of cheap credit and rising housing prices. However, the Financial Crisis put an end to this growth, and would cut the DJIA from 14,000 points to below 6,600 points.

The admin on there, who is also a analyst, send out alerts on what options to buy (usually 1 to 2 alerts) per day. And I gotta admit, they have been pretty accurate so far.

In a stock market where investors are used to being disappointed, Tuesday’s plunge still shocked.

China’s benchmark equity gauge sank almost 5 percent at one point and by the close, the escalating tensions with the U.S. had sent 1,023 stocks down by the daily 10 percent limit -- or more than one in four. Greasing the losses was the Shanghai Composite Index’s slide below 3,000, a level previously breached during market crashes in 2015 and 2016.

With Washington and Beijing threatening tit-for-tat moves over import tariffs, investors are [worried](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PAK5XZ6K50YA) a trade war will act as a brake on China’s economy and hollow out an already deflating equity market.

Selling intensified [last week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PAAU6N6JIJUQ) after data showed weak spots in China’s economy. Rising corporate defaults and the government’s financial deleveraging campaign are also undermining sentiment. But the death of buy-the-dip is all the more dramatic at a time when company profits are rising, a sign that investor pessimism may be snowballing beyond repair.

“Seeing the benchmark dropping below the 3,000 level hurts sentiment even more,” said Hao Hong, chief strategist with Bocom International Holdings Co. in Hong Kong. “Things could get a lot worse if the trade war escalates and China fights back in an unconventional way. I would advise against buying into the selloff.”";126616;China Rout Has 1,023 Stocks Plunging 10% in One Day;

The WhaleIndex® tracks the highest-conviction stocks held by leading hedge fund managers. It is a long-only index that tracks the 100 most commonly held stocks disclosed on the quarterly 13F regulatory filings of consistently successful managers. The index is equal-weighted and rebalanced on a quarterly basis 46 days after the end of each quarter.

WhaleWisdom tracks all managers who file 13F regulatory filings with the SEC and ranks a select number of managers using the proprietary WhaleScore. To qualify for a WhaleScore, a manager must have the following attributes: between 5 and 750 holdings in their 13F filing, have at least 3 consecutive years of quarterly 13F filings, hold no fewer than five stocks in its portfolio, manage more than $100 million in marketable securities, and hold at least 20% of its portfolio in its top 20 stocks. Managers considered to be a bank, trust, pension, or insurance company are also excluded.

The top 60 managers who have maintained an average WhaleScore over the past year higher than the one-year average WhaleScore of the S&amp;P 500 is used in the WhaleIndex. Based on the holdings disclosed on their SEC filings, WhaleWisdom identifies the 100 stocks most commonly held among the respective managers' top 20 holdings.

If you haven't visited in a while, both the WhaleScore and resulting WhaleIndex were completely redesigned in June 2016. The redesign addressed limitations in the previous calculation and also corrected a look-ahead bias in the data being used. The redesign also changed the performance measures used to determine WhaleScores in order to achieve better performance. WhaleWisdom reserves the right to update/replace the WhaleScore and WhaleIndex at any time due to improvements in modeling and Alpha prediction.

lykosen11;1529497892;8shx9h;;5;;43;"**Hello!**  
I am /r/lykosen11 and I recently have been looking at some young fast international growers, and after looking at a few, I decided to deep dive. Here is my writeup of my fundamental DCF and business analysis of BEST INC.

______________________________________________________________________________

**The Business**  

BEST INC. is a China based Smart Supply chain service company, which uses multiple platforms to create an easy way for new as well as old businesses to flourish without having to worry about logistics. They have a multitude of different platforms and aim  to integrate technology with everything from parcel handling in warehouses to local smart stores, as well as everything moving in between. Because of the macroeconomic situation over in China, the company's market is growing by the quarter with new businesses that want to take a foothold in the market, but need to offload the immense work that is infrastructure, logistics and the design of those.

The BEST Cloud services uses data to help businesses pick out route assignments, optimal partner selections, inventory management, fulfillment planning and methods to optimize all these. The business is sold as SaaS, and reap the benefits from that business model (great margins, recurring revenue, etc).

Their shipping businesses, BEST Freight and Best Express handle cargo and parcels respectively. They use a per package payment method to sell their immense distribution network to other businesses. They hold almost 5 million square meters of warehouse space and while a majority is located within china, they offer services out of the country as well. Germany, Australia, USA, Japan and Canada all have their distribution centers, and they are looking to expand into Thailand, Spain, Korea and Taiwan.

Last but not least, they have their newest service, the BEST STORE+, which is a local store business they use to get the last mile fulfillment done, the hardest part of the business. Stores where sales can be made, while sending, receiving and handling shipping for parcels can efficiently be done. It is fairly new, and is growing very very well.
_______________________________________________________________________________________

**Growth &amp; Financials**  
The business today is growing by roughly 50%, but as they had their IPO last year very little can be assumed. They are growing their parcel fulfillment volume at roughly 60%, while the chinese shipping market is only growing 30% (both Y/Y). They today hold over 375 thousand membership stores, with 452 brands within. They currently hold 9.6% of the shipping market now in Q118, which is up from 7.5% Q1 last year, which means that they are taking additional market share in a growing market. 

They are currently holding $480 million NET cash, with debt exceptionally low for a growing logistics company. During 2017, they had a revenue of $3 Billions, and according to their guidance 2018 will be roughly 51% higher, at $4.47 Billions. They use this revenue to finance their growth and the increasing cost of labor, and right now they are not profitable. Their net loss in 2017 was $189 million. In 2017 however they held their first positive gross margin, a fantastic sign, at 2.4%. Along this however, they have a -6.4% operating margin and -6.14% net margin, as their financial income is positive.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

**Modelling &amp; My Thoughts**  
The model for a company like this becomes fairly sketchy, as very little historical data is available. Using some number crunching you can figure out quite a bit however, and you need to have some numbers to back up your thesis in my eyes. My financial model for $BSTI assumes that the net loss peaks at 2023, while their margins grow. When analyzing the prospects of a unprofitable growth story, you have to assume something, but it is important to be bordering pessimistic to get a realistic view. It is easy to create what you want to find in these cases. I assume that the revenue growth has peaked, and wil fall up ad infinitum at roughly 2-4% rate. I do however think their margins will keep growing at the same rate they have been, up to a gross margin of 8%. This number is low, however, it is to hard to predict anything except small cumulative growth. 

I think this is a very young growth story, at a market cap of not even 5 billion USD, to be less than 10 years since the company was founded and 1 year off IPO. It makes it very hard to predict what will happen, and it is made even more difficult by the Chinese development story. I have attempted to offset this but not assuming to optimistic scenarios, as well as attaching a high discount rate (9%) and maturity (-3%) to reflect the risks. That said, it does not make the stock a less risky pick. The non-financial growth numbers look fantastic, and they outperform/match the financial numbers, which indicates that the company has natural growth. If they are ever put in the position where they can use their pricing power from their high-tech services, they can really flourish. That combined with the strong partnerships they hold, with Bank of China, Visa, Mastercard and Alibaba, makes them very very strong. 

There is tons of risk as the business is very capital heavy, with over extensions in their logistics network ([similar to the risk with JD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lykosen/comments/8orunk/answer_jdcom_risks_summary/)), strong competitors (although none which employ as much IT/DATA technology in their services), and bad current margins. However,  there is much to like as well. Strong net cash position, immense natural growth, growing faster than the fast growing market as well as China develops, a lot of business will be made and all of them will need logistics.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

**My Verdict**  
My model is very sporadic, which makes price targets irrelevant. However, since a lot of people like it for my bottom line, here it is: 27 USD. 129% upside. I made different models for each scenario, optimistics scenarios, scenarios where growth slow down but they adapt with pricing, pessimistic scenarios, scenarios where they fail to improve their margins because of competition, etc. I then analyse what I think is the probability of each scenario so I can create the model I believe in the most. Logistics is a tough business, and normally growth is fairly slow and expensive. I must say however I respect immensely how BEST is paying for their growth up front and not with debt. I also like that they have strong allies that are friendly with the local government, which makes them more government-proof (always a risk with China). I like seeing that they take more market share as the quarters come and go, as well as they are growing their by far highest margin business, their Store+, the fastest at 74%. A lot of other good companies like Amazon, Apple and Microsoft have done the same with AWS, Apple Services and Microsoft cloud services. Growing fast in high margin businesses is the optimal way to high earnings, and when BEST INC gets any earnings whatsoever, I believe they will be strong. That said, this is a slow story, and it will take a while before that point is reached. I buy $BSTI knowing that they might not move much this year even, but when they start moving I want to be a shareholder. Know the risks though.

kalashnikov54;1529588538;8sryd9;;2;;4;I’m a thematic investor and the timing couldn’t have been better with this one. With an analytics background academically I recently joined the workforce and realized how data science is prevalent in large enterprises, everybody trying to do their best with all the information they have but a major bottleneck is talent. Not everyone could code. Lack of tech talent was forcing business focussed employees to get hands dirty with data manipulation and self service drag and drop tools were being used widely. A similar need for better visualization drove DATA and I feel AYX might benefit from this too.

badpauly;1529866618;8tjyy4;;1;;2;"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

badpauly;1529866668;8tjz5l;;11;;16;"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

#[Frontrunning: June 25th](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-06-25/frontrunning-june-25)

* The Wall Street Journal reported that President Donald Trump plans to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. tech and to block additional technology exports to China. The two measures are set to be announced by the end of the week.
* Trump issued a stark warning to the U.S. trading partners over the weekend. He called on global economies to end to all protectionist barriers, or face a new round of retaliatory measures. ""Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!"" the president said. (CNBC)
* Trump said that people who enter the U.S. illegally should be sent back to where they came from immediately without any judicial process. He didn't differentiate between people who entered the United States to seek asylum and illegal immigrants. (Reuters)
* Porn actress Stormy Daniels was scheduled to meet with federal prosecutors today as part of their investigation into Trump’s longtime personal attorney. However, the meeting was abruptly cancelled after it was reported by news outlets, her attorney said. (AP)
* Battles will be settled on Tuesday between the establishment and activist wings of Democratic and Republican parties as voters head to the polls. Primaries will be held in Colorado, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah. (USA Today)
* Republican Sen. Jeff Flake suggested he may use his role on the Senate Judiciary Committee to extract concessions from Trump. Flake, who has criticized Trump previously, added that he could team up with other pro-trade Republicans to delay judicial nominees. (Washington Post)
* A 15-year-old boy who was housed in a large migrant shelter in Texas walked off the premises and disappeared into the border land. The operator said it was not allowed to restrain children, raising questions about who is responsible for their safety. (NY Times)
* President Recep Tayyip Erdogan won Turkey's landmark electionSunday, ushering in a new system. On already shaky footing, Turkey’s economy and assets are likely to be affected as all eyes turn to what the powerful and growth-hungry Erdogan will do next. (AP &amp; CNBC)
* Uber will argue that in court today that it is ""fit and proper"" to hold a license to operate in London after regulators stripped it of one last year. Uber made changes to its service, including reporting serious incidents to the police directly and controlling drivers' working hours. (CNBC)
* The combined firepower of “Fallen Kingdom” and “Incredibles 2"" fueled $280 million in total ticket sales, making it Hollywood’s fourth-biggest overall weekend ever, not accounting for inflation. Business was roughly double what it was the same June weekend last year, according to comScore.

The week began with 2 quiet trading days, which I took advantage of by reading general tech news (and learning how to sous vide but that’s for another blog). There were many interesting tech articles out last weekend and this week, especially in AI, which remains one of the hottest topic among tech investors. See my daily notes for links.

Then on Tuesday, after the close, ORCL reported decent earnings but issued weak next-quarter guidance and analysts raised questions on the health of its cloud business as the company decided not to disclose cloud revenues. ORCL traded down 7.5&amp;#37; on Wednesday. After that, RHT reported on Thursday after the close, which really set the tech market on fire. While most head-line metrics looked OK, RHT posted weaker-than-expected billings (+12&amp;#37; y/y vs. +15&amp;#37; y/y) and management lowered its FY guidance due to FX headwinds. In addition, management disclosed that the contract renewal pool is down y/y, which implies a headwind for near-term billings. The stock fell in the mid-teens on Friday.

The two weak tech earnings came at a time of increasing concern around tech valuation, especially software / SaaS names. For example, there were multiple valuation-drive downgrades on Thursday, including CHGG and ELLI. So in conclusion, it looks to me that we are at the start of a tech correction that may last for a 5 trading days or more. Of course, no one knows exactly what will happens, which is why tech investors have their eyes glued on the event / earnings calendar as well as keeping an eye on the health of the IPO market. By my count, there are 12 IPOs scheduled for this week.

I have some shares in a company that declared bankruptcy. Currently as far as I know you cannot purchase anymore shares just sell what you have for change basically. But recently the company was purchased and brought back from the dead and their stock has started fluctuating again. What I’m wondering is if they get back to the point where you can trade their stock will it be the same shares I own or will it be under another name or does that depend on what happened when the company was purchased?

* President Trump's clout within the GOP is on the line in today's elections. Voters will weigh in on candidates in seven states, but the contest that matters most to Trump is South Carolina, where he appeared at a rally to help Gov. Henry McMaster before polls opened. (AP)
* Top tech companies, including Amazon and Apple, met with U.S. intelligence officials last month to discuss preparations for the midterm elections, The New York Times reported. It came in anticipation of a repeat of the Russian meddling that occurred during the 2016 election.
* Peter Navarro, one of Trump's top trade advisors, said the market was overreacting Monday to fears the administration would restrict foreign investment as part of its trade actions. He said investors should focus on the White House's efforts to protect American exports.
* Border officials have suspended handing over migrant families to prosecutors, effectively reviving the Obama administration’s “catch and release” policy that has angered Trump. Prosecutions of adults crossing the border without children continued. (NY Times)
* Despite public outrage over Trump's immigration policy of separating children from their parents who crossed into the U.S. unauthorized, the president's approval rating has not deviated from its recent upward trend, according to recently released surveys. (CNBC)
* Conservative Rep. Steve King tweeted the U.S. is heading toward another civil war. The tweet came with a link to an article about a group of protesters who were staging an ""occupy""-style campout in front an Immigration and Customs Enforcement holding facility. (USA Today)
* Jerry Storch, a former CEO of bankrupt Toys R Us, is considering reviving the toy retailer, according to Bloomberg. He has been working with Credit Suisse Group and Fairfax Financial Holdings to stitch his plan together. Toys R Us finishes shuttering its locations this week.
* A new survey finds it's still tough to be a woman on Wall Street and men don't always notice. A Catalyst study reports that fewer than 17 percent of senior leaders in investment banking are women. All the top banks are run by men.
* Elon Musk has been running a secretive, highly selective private schoolout of SpaceX’s headquarters in California, according to a report. There is heavy emphasis on math, science, engineering and ethics — at the expense of instruction in languages, music and sports.

&gt; **General Electric** – GE announced plans to spin off its health-care unit, selling 20 percent and distributing the rest to shareholders, and it will also exit its stake in Baker Hughes over the next two to three years. Today is also the first time since 1907 that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will trade without GE as a member, with the stock replaced in the Dow by Walgreens Boots Alliance.

&gt; **Lennar** – The home builder beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines with its second-quarter earnings, as new orders surged more than 62 percent from a year ago and home prices increased by more than 10 percent.

&gt; **FactSet Research Systems** – The financial information services provider reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.18 per share, 5 cents a share above estimates. Revenue came in slightly above forecasts. FactSet said it was benefiting from a successful integration of its acquisitions as well as boosting organic growth.

&gt; **Harley-Davidson**– Harley remains on watch, after enduring criticism from President Donald Trump for its plans to move some production out of the U.S. because of European Union tariffs. Harley shares fell yesterday after the motorcycle maker said that the tariffs would add $2,200 to the cost of each motorcycle exported to the EU from the U.S.

&gt; **Vale, BHP Billiton** – The mining companies have signed a settlement with Brazilian authorities that settles a $5.3 billion lawsuit over the 2015 dam disaster that killed 19 people.

&gt; **GW Pharmaceuticals** – GW won Food and Drug Administration approval for its drug to treat epilepsy, the first-ever cannabis-based treatment to be approved in the United States.

&gt; **Northrop Grumman** – The defense contractor struck a deal to sell six U.S. Titan drone aircraft to the Australian government in a $5.1 billion deal.

&gt; **TJX Cos.** – The parent of Marshall’s and TJ Maxx was downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” at Atlantic Equities, which cited valuation as its key reason. The retailer’s stock is up more than 24 percent so far this year.

&gt; **AMC Networks** – AMC was downgraded to “neutral” from “buy” at Goldman Sachs, which points to slower advertising growth at the cable television channel provider.

&gt; **Ocwen Financial** – Ocwen named its chief investment officer John Britti as interim CEO upon the retirement of current CEO Ronald Faris at the end of this month. Ocwen is in the process of acquiring financial services company PHH Corp., and when that deal closes later this y ear, former PHH CEO Glen Messina will take the same job at Ocwen.

&gt; **Copart** – Copart will be joining the S&amp;P 500 prior to the open on July 2. The provider of online auction and vehicle marketing services will replace Dr Pepper Snapple, which is in the process of merging with Keurig Green Mountain and will no longer be eligible for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 following that transaction. Copart’s place in the S&amp;P MidCap 400 will be taken by cancer treatment developer Exelixis.

&gt; **MGM Resorts** – MGM was downgraded to ""neutral"" from “buy” at Goldman Sachs and removed from Goldman’s “Conviction List,” citing delays in various positive factors taking hold including an expected recovery at MGM’s Mandalay Bay property.

&gt; **Spotify** – Spotify was rated “overweight” in new coverage at Barclays, citing the streaming music service’s ability to innovate, create best-in-class products and user experiences.

If Disney pulls off a streaming service and can offer all of their content on it (House of Mouse stuff, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, ESPN stuff) then they would have the streaming platform with the best content. They could stream new release movies direct to consumer. They could stream Monday Night Football (ESPN holds the right to this broadcast) straight to consumer, no cable required. 

Netflix has a higher market cap than Disney. Disney can do what Netflix is doing now, but better, in probably two years. Once the other major content providers develop their own streaming platforms what's going to be left on Netflix?

You're telling me the corpse of House of Cards and Stranger Things is going to be a bigger draw than what Disney can offer? No way. I love that Netflix produces their own content but theyre literally 70 years behind Disney on content library. 

Why is the market not reacting to Disneys potential? Do they not think Disney will acquire Hulu?

I realize the Disney acquisition of FOX is a lot more than Hulu and some IP, but that's literally all I'm focusing on and it should still be more than enough to send Disney's value way way up.

What gives? What am I not appreciating? ";128530;I don't understand why people aren't higher on Disney;

sisumoney;1530192490;8ujek0;;12;;6;"CNBC: Amazon plans to acquire online pharmacy PillPack, the companies announced Thursday.
CNBC has reported on Amazon's push into the pharmacy industry. The deal will give Amazon an immediate platform into the business of selling drugs.
Shares of drugstore chains Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS Health and Rite Aid all tanked on the news.
PillPack packages organize and deliver drugs. It sends consumers packages with the specific number of medications they're supposed to take at specific times. It boasts a ""full-service"" pharmacy, meaning its customer service team is available 24/7.

There are two things I see here. One, Amazon has a really long runway. If there is a product that can be delivered to you they will find a way. 

Two, is it time to either bail out of the pharmacy stocks and or short them? Will they become the next victim of Amazon?

A hedge fund that reaped an outrageous gain in February’s vol-mageddon is eyeing a fresh target.  Houndstooth Capital Management LLC secured a 6,000 percent return from a bearish bet on an exchange-traded product tied to calm markets.  Now, the $7.5 million fund sees trouble in an ETF designed to profit from the opposite -- turbulence in stocks. It’s wagering technical forces in the volatility complex will help spur a swift return to stability in the wake of a blowout, undoing the leveraged product in its wake.   It goes like this: Even though Houndstooth expects another surge in price swings, it’s using out-of-the-money puts with near-term maturities to bet against the $413 million ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF. UVXY, as it is known, is one of the most liquid, leveraged ETFs that profit from rising volatility. The theory is that after an initial spike there will be a snapback in vol that will decimate the product.  “We’re looking for areas where buying or selling volatility is mispriced by the market, or at least where we think there’s a very good risk-reward trade-off,” Lincoln Edwards, founder at Houndstooth, said in an interview. “There’s a risk that another massive VIX spike could destroy UVXY in a single day.”  Tucker Hewes, a spokesman for ProShares at Hewes Communications, declined to comment.  At $70,000 the trade is modest, but it highlights the contentious issue of whether securities such as UVXY can exert an outsize pull on the very contracts they track, exacerbating their own volatility in the process.  Hot Summer  Volatility investing has boomed in recent years as ETPs offered cheap and liquid ways for professional money managers and retail investors to punt on the burgeoning asset class. As Wall Street warns of a “hot” summer full of risk, and a more normal regime for volatility after two placid years, many traders are betting on bigger price swings in the latter half of the year.   And that’s how Houndstooth made its spectacular February return. The Austin, Texas-based firm bought put options on the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, or SVXY, thinking that an upward move in the Cboe Volatility Index would shake sellers out of their torpor. Sure enough, the gauge staged a record-one day spike, sending the ETF plummeting 83 percent -- and handing the fund its best-ever first quarter with a double-digit gain.  Houndstooth reckons it has a keen eye for technical risks in the underbelly of the volatility complex. Since the VIX isn’t tradable, many products hold futures contracts on the gauge. Given their size, some participants say they can exert a large pull on the price of the assets they track, underscored by the spectacular collapse of ETNs linked to calm markets in February.  Both long and short products buy and sell futures contracts on a daily basis to maintain their desired degree of exposure to implied equity volatility. That means a large one-way move in the VIX can dramatically increase the number of contracts they need to buy -- challenging liquidity and potentially driving the price of futures higher, according to Edwards.   Cboe Global Markets Inc. didn’t immediately respond to an email request seeking comment. It has recently outlined changes to the monthly auction for the VIX settlement.  Scenarios  For the Houndstooth strategy to pay off, VIX futures need to lose two-thirds of their value in a single day. That, in theory, would be enough to send the price of the 1.5-times leveraged UVXY to zero.  “Even if VIX futures gained 200 percent or even 10,000 percent in a single day, a one-day decline of 66 percent makes UVXY worth $0 regardless of how high it climbed,” Edwards said.  Of course, the grip ETFs assert on VIX futures likely diminished after February, as products either closed or shrank, while several ProShares ETFs reduced leverage, including UVXY, curbing their need to rebalance after sharp moves.  And the scenario didn’t play out after the VIX’s record spike on Feb. 5. The next day, the volatility gauge slumped by one-fifth -- only enough to send UVXY down by a third for the day.  Still, buying put options on the ETF rather than shorting it allows Houndstooth to limit potential losses on the trade, and there are a few scenarios that could lead to its success.  Under one, the VIX spikes from its current level to 40. The next day, as panic eases, the gauge knifes back down, its movements exacerbated by long buyers rushing to cover positions, and by volatility products flooding the futures market to rebalance holdings.  In another, the VIX could surge on bad-news speculation and then quickly reverse, producing a large enough intraday spike for the bet to pay off. Alternatively, the gauge could gradually climb higher -- only to deflate suddenly if favorable news emerges.  Edwards believes volatility is poised to move higher as November’s U.S. congressional elections approach.  “We’ll also see a third interest-rate hike, which will spark much more volatility than what we’re seeing now. Political uncertainty in Europe will continue causing major fits of volatility. Expect to see the VIX over 30 at least one more time this year,” he said.   The Houndstooth investor concedes that a 6,000 percent return on the strategy is a tail scenario -- but one “that’s massively underappreciated and underpriced.”";128661;Hedge Fund That Made 6,000% on VIX Jump Bets on Next Blow-Up;

I funded the account with 4,000 and now it's worth so much more I feel like this isn't really a huge loss if I start from stratch... what are your thoughts on this?

I go to twitter.com on Chrome browser, find the Elon post about the Short Shorts, look through the comments and cannot find that comment advertising the scammy BTC/ETH giveaway anywhere.

I'm a total beginner and have no idea how any of this works and would like to learn it.
I've heard about Ben Graham, but some people say his books are outdated, so it would be nice if the book would be up to date.

Thank you

PS.: Sorry for bad English";129324;Which book to learn about the stock market;
TexanTrex;1530504034;8vfoz2;;3;;0;Im a third year in college and starting to make money. Im trying to figure out where to put it, I understand that my student loans have interest. But, I figure once I get out of college and start making more than a minimum wage job it will be easier to pay them off. So I should I take the couple grand I earn now and start investing? Or just put it straight into my loans? Or something else? Taking any suggestions.;129336;Help;
IAmGruck;1530511079;8vgbml;;2;;0;Hello, I’m 15 years old and have a few questions about finding resources. Firstly, is there a place to find all the definitions and meanings that are commonplace in the investment world? (index funds, ETF’s, etc) Secondly, are there some good beginner books that introduce you to the Stock Market as a whole, I find Investopedia references too many things that I don’t yet understand and it can be overwhelming. Finally, where do you look to find the information needed to buy a stock. For instance, if I wanted to buy SBUX, where could I find their profits, recent news, sales, acquisitions, etc. ;129349;Resources;
mike_concho;1530514424;8vglos;;13;;0;I've tried to mess around a little with stock trading before, but I've always stopped because it is difficult for me to do anything during the day. I know I could do this if I used a long strategic but I'm looking for something more day to day. Anyone else in my position and have some advice?;129355;Can I start to learn the market if I can't react during the day?;

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

badpauly;1530515899;8vgqbs;;2;;1;"

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

BR-Technicals;1530560362;8vlkuy;;9;;35;"### Key Points

* The retail ETF XRT has made new highs after breaking out of a price range.
*  Consumers are benefiting from tax breaks and low unemployment, giving them extra cash to spend.
* The way the index is built has supported the sector, even though the “retail apocalypse” is upon us.
* However, the breakout is in jeopardy.

## Consumer Sentiment Near Expansion Highs

Investor sentiment around the retail sector has been low in recent years, as many investors feared that Amazon and other internet companies are hurting big names like JC Penny’s and Sears. While these two company stocks look dismal, to say the least, the retail sector, as told by XRT, has recently broken out to new highs.

In this blog we analyze the retail sector of the stock market/economy using technical and economic analysis. 

The XRT ETF has made new highs and broken out of a range that initially peaked in 2015. Is there a revival in the retail sector?

## Economic Boosts for Consumers

Retail revolves around the consumer. The tax cuts this year should help retail companies in two ways. First, they can help their balance sheet, as less costs will make these companies stronger. 

More importantly, it should also help increase discretionary spending by consumers, because they should have more cash in their wallets. 

Also, the lowering unemployment rate means there are more people able to consume. Rising employment tells us two things. One, employers are busy enough to need more employees, and two there is more money circulating in the economic system. Both are important to the retail sector.

These economic boosts have led to high consumer sentiment. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment indicator is a monthly survey designed to measure how consumers are feeling about present and future economic conditions. 

When sentiment is high, consumers are more likely to spend discretionary money. Discretionary money is the extra cash consumers have after paying for their more necessary items. Tax cuts and jobs have increased the amount of discretionary within the economy, and it has pushed up overall sentiment. 

People are more likely to spend discretionary cash when sentiment is high because they feel that the economy is strong, and their jobs safe; they do not need to worry as much about the future. Therefore, they do not need/want to save as much, and they can spend some extra money on new shoes, a new dress, or that fancy watch they have had their eye on.

## A Broader Sector: Consumer Discretionary

Before looking directly at the retail sector, we look at the broader consumer discretionary sector. XLY – the Consumer Discretionary SPDR ETF – is one of three main sector ETFs to make new highs after January. The only other sectors are energy and technology. 

With the market struggling the way they are, consumer discretionary stocks are some of the bright spots. Like the retail sector, discretionary stocks have seen some benefits from the current economic environment, and they make them a prime target for investors.

## Breaking Down the ETF

While XRT holds stocks like JC Penny’s (JCP), which is down more than -33&amp;#37; year-to-date (YTD), there are some surprises from stocks like Macy’s (M), which is up more than 48&amp;#37;. YTD. 

Something that has helped the sector is high short interest in retail stocks. Investors have dubbed a “retail apocalypse.” The internet has not been kind to retailers and their stores. Now that consumers can find products with ease, and it is shipped directly to their homes, they no longer shop at actual brick and mortar stores.

This has led many investors to short sell retail stocks. So, when earnings surprises happen, and there is high short interest, short sellers buy back shares and quickly push prices higher. Surprises from stocks like Kohl’s and Macy’s have helped the ETF to breakout to new highs.

 However, the ETF also holds a couple technology/retail stocks that have really supported the sector. Amazon (AMZN, +40&amp;#37; YTD) and Netflix (NFLX, +90&amp;#37; YTD) are two FAANG stocks contained within the index. These stocks have performed phenomenally over the last few years, but I have my doubts about their sustainability.

## Risks to the Sector

The biggest risk to the sector is a trade war. Many retail items are imported from other countries where labor is much cheaper. Tariffs and trade wars will ultimately hurt the sector as costs are raised on their items. This will hurt margins, and their balance sheets will weaken.

Additionally, tariffs and trade wars will also hurt consumers and consumer sentiment. When prices are rising, and jobs are moving overseas, or people are being laid off because of trade disputes, it will ultimately hurt the economy and the likelihood of extra spending at the store. Consumers won’t want to spend the extra money to buy something they don’t really need if they are concerned or uncertain about the future of the economy.

## Conclusion

Overall, this breakout is doubtful. The stocks contained within the ETF are all over the spectrum of returns. JCP is down more than 30&amp;#37;, but stocks like M and AMZN are up more than 40&amp;#37;. 

From an economic standpoint it is hard to see retail and the economy getting much better from here. We are in the later end of the expansion cycle, and the current trade rhetoric can have lasting damage on the economy, especially if we move into a full blown trade war.

Lastly, Nike (NKE) reported earnings on June 28, and the stock closed the next day up over 11.5&amp;#37;. Executives from this apparel company offered a great outlook and surprising Q4 numbers, propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Stock higher.

One reason the company has performed so well is because they are bypassing retail stores, and going direct to consumer. This is a trend that has been shifting the retail sector for many years, and one of the reasons for the so called apocalypse. More and more companies are launching their own retail channels and websites where they can deal directly to consumers, and skip the middle man. This is not a good trend for retailers.

### The Trade Setup

For the trade, you will want to look for the signs of a strong breakout in the ETF. You will want to look to enter the stock around $50.50, which is a 3&amp;#37; buffer above the resistance line. This will help determine that the breakout is real, and not just part of normal volatility. Your stop should be placed just below the resistance line. That way, you are prepared to sell if the breakout fails.";129478;Retail Breaks Out to New Highs;

CRON has stated that a plan is in place should the US carry forward with a Federal Legalization agreement. However I'm predicting a surge in growth of companies like this not long after should that occur. This could make investments like CRON volatile in the Long Term.

President Donald Trump is preparing to slap tariffs on Chinese goods early Friday, the first shot in a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.

Tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to take effect at 12:01 a.m. in Washington, the U.S. Trade Representative confirmed in an email Thursday. The milestone marks a new and damaging phase in a conflict that has roiled markets and cast a shadow over the global growth outlook.

In Beijing, policy makers are digging in for what could be a protracted fight -- one in which they say they won’t be the aggressor. Beijing has said retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods ranging from soybeans to pork will go into effect immediately after the U.S. acts.

With further tit-for-tat levies already threatened between the U.S. and China, some investors are concerned this week may mark the start of a trade war that spreads globally. Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines.

As the deadline approached with little sign of a last-minute deal, U.S. stocks pared gains. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index was up 0.3 percent at 11:15 a.m. in New York, after earlier rising as much as 0.6 percent.

The looming tariffs have prompted central bank officials to try to reassure investors. The European Union has taken a firm stance ahead of the escalation, with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney saying that the rise of protectionism will affect trade flows and push up import costs.

Here’s a run down of the key facts about China’s position in the conflict:

### What goods are to be targeted?

On June 15, Trump said the U.S. would begin charging additional duties of 25 percent on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports in response to what he says is theft of American intellectual property. That’s split into two rounds -- $34 billion on Friday and $16 billion later.

China has said it will fight back with “equal scale, equal intensity.”

### How will the tariffs be implemented?

Customs services for the U.S. and China will be responsible for collecting the new tariffs as imports pass through the port of entry. When products on the list for extra levies are declared to customs, the importer will pay the additional levies.

### Are markets ready?

Chinese stocks have taken a beating in recent weeks, entering a bear market, as concerns about the trade-war have mingled with worries about how an ongoing debt-control campaign will feed through into the outlook for economic growth.

People’s Bank of China Party Chief Guo Shuqing sought to calm markets, saying bond market risks are controllable and the economy is capable of bearing the impacts of trade frictions. The economic fundamentals mean a sharp depreciation of the yuan is unlikely, he said in an [interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PBE4I36JIJVD) with the Financial News.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on June 20 that officials are beginning to hear that companies are postponing investment and hiring due to uncertainty about what comes next. “Changes in trade policy could cause us to have to question the outlook,” he [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-20/u-s-trade-disputes-get-top-central-bankers-increasingly-worried) during a panel talk in Portugal.

U.S. stocks have wobbled on trade frictions, but the S&amp;P 500 Index remains roughly level from the start of the year.

### What can the real-world impact be?

The tariffs are already having an effect. As an example, Chinese companies are [reselling](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PB1V766K50XS) U.S. soybeans, and Chinese companies are expected to [cancel](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-03/china-to-cancel-more-u-s-soy-shipments-as-extra-tariff-looms) most of the remaining soybeans they have committed to buy from the U.S. in the year ending Aug. 31, once the extra tariffs take effect.

Some American business are bracing for impact. U.S. manufacturers and business groups have said the tariffs could increase their costs and lead to higher prices for consumers.";130109;Trump to Pull Tariff Trigger at Midnight in Trade-War Escalation;

AlexPitti;1530849210;8wgya5;;2;;8;"Firstly, there are always leaders in the market. It’s usually good to have the fastest growing firms leading the market because if the value stocks with low growth are the leaders, it generally means the market is in ‘risk off’ mode and possibly going lower. Secondly, this is a misleading assumption because there are many stocks in the index which are down. You could add up all the stocks which have increased in the index and it will lead to much more than 122% of the gains. 

The way you can understand how this is misleading is that the equal weighted S&amp;P 500 was up 1.67% in the first half, while the normal market cap weighted index was up 2.52%. If only the top firms provided the gains, how come an equal weighted index, which isn’t bolstered as much by the big cap firms like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google, did nearly as well? It’s because the gains were broad based.

I’m just being realistic, and I’m not talking about having couple millions of dollars at 65. This stock market that I’m thinking about switching to is basically for clothes. Lots of people buy and sell limited clothes and shoes for hundreds and hundreds of dollars sometimes even thousands, depending on how rare and limited they are. And buying them for as low as $160 and highest $300-$350. A lot of money can be made in this market but you have to know what you’re buying. You can’t be buying anything and expect to make a lot of profit. Some items actually resell for way less than you got them for. I’m not planning on selling my stocks right now, I’m gonna wait until it goes back up and then move. I just want some advice before I do a move this big.;130746;Leaving the stock market?;

Hello. I'm 20 years old right now and currently in college. I just want to get this off my chest as it's been bothering me.

3 years ago, i was in senior year of high school and before the last day of school, my business teacher told everyone in the class about the stock market. I became very interested as he told everyone about the possibities of earning alot of money from the market. As any 17 year old, i was a money crazed little shit but i think everyone was. 2 months later, i graduated, 18 and got a job as a bike pizza delivery guy. I saved up 20k along with 10k that i saved from my high school years and decided to throw it all in on robinhood.

After a month of trading, i was down 2k so i stopped and studied more about the stock market. While i was studying, i found this paid forum (600/year) that had a 2 week free trial. I decided to sign up.

One guy would be on a skype voice channel and everyone can join but only he could talk. He would give alerts telling everyone what price to buy and to sell ""buy at 6.60 sell at 6.67"". I was skeptical for the first few days but decided to follow his alerts. After my 2 weeks, i was up 3k for a total of 31k.

I decided to pay for the membership which gave me access to being able to chat in the forums and to chat in skype real time. I would ask him and the other members why a certain alert was being made. I learned alot. I learned support and resistance, level 2, reading candles, alot of stuff about the stock market but i never applied that to my trades. All i did was blindly follow the alerts that he gave.

I did this for the past 3 years and I got up all the way to 275k.

Honestly, i feel like shit. I'm a fraud. I profited off of other people's work. I didn't do anything. I told my friends about this and they envied me. The only one that knew how i was feeling was my girlfriend. She supported me saying that i paid for the membership and whatever i do with their resources is no one's business.

I don't know what to do. I feel really bad for what i did. Knowing that other people work all day for minimum wage and some people have no job or is in big debt makes me feel like what I'm doing is wrong.

I just wanted to get this off my chest. If you read all the way this far. Thanks for listening. If you want to know the channel that i paid for, just DM me. Maybe it's just me that got hit with these types of feels. Maybe you'll pay for a subscription and make alot of money and not feel bad about it. I guess that i felt bad knowing that i just took money off of other people's pockets without doing anything. I just really don't know how to deal with this anymore.

TLDR - IDK how to shorten it. I just feel like shit.";130763;Feeling bad. I don't know if this is right.;

I am a German/American dual citizen, aged 20 and still a student. I've been living in Germany now for the past 8 years. 

I've come into a bit of money through my grandparents and want to start investing long-term.

However - evidently German Banks only open brokerage accounts for clients with *""US-relations""* in very special cases (due to a huge paperwork workload for the IRS, as I understand).

The only alternative for me is to start a brokerage account back in the states, as relinquishing my citizenship is not an option for me.

The truth is: I am **completely** overwhelmed by many things. I'm a musician with next to no stockmarket-related knowledge. Can anyone/other expats confronted with the same problems give me some general advice / a suggestion in what US-bank to open my brokerage account? I am looking at Interactive Brokers and or Schwab, but would appreciate input from more seasoned veterans. The money amount in question is less than 20k - or there any implications here?

I'm not looking to do a lot of buying and selling - mostly a safe option to keep my money. I will be staying in Germany long-term (due to family).

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Source: [Fintel.io/insiders](https://fintel.io/insiders)";130819;Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days);
badpauly;1531064514;8x2a46;;0;;4;"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

iamwalri17;1531153267;8xd7zu;;3;;2;"I pay attention to the market on and off again, for years.  

I remember back under Obama, when they changed the way unemployment was calculated... so that the MILLIONS of people who gave up looking for jobs due to wage stagnation, and drug addiction, aren't counted as unemployed.

So, in the financial world, I think it's pretty common knowledge that the new unemployment numbers are bull-crap, and really don't say much of ANYTHING positive about the economy(except that there are tons of drug addicts, and depressed people who gave up looking for jobs).

I mean, for years now, wage growth has been stagnant, and losing to inflation(which caused them to have to rise minimum wage... but that rise is slower than inflation's rise).  

So, when I hear that the market is now for multiple days up a few hundred points, because of these ""Jobs Numbers"", which don't really say much... I get confused.

Are people really this ignorant, and think these U3 numbers really mean all that much?  I don't understand... wouldn't the banks, and big investment firms, and computers be buying/selling/moving the market more than the ignorant people who don't understand U3 is near useless?

I just find it odd that about 90% of people on TV pretend that the Unemployment number didn't completely change a few years ago.   Trump saying ""Blacks at lowest unemployment in US History"" is another obvious mistruth... yet I don't see people counter him on it... because it seems a large number of people on BOTH sides of the aisle don't want to bring up the fact that the FED has been fudging the numbers since Obama.

On top of this, around the same time I believe, the Fed stopped reporting a key Money supply number(M3, M4, I forget).  I just don't understand why people don't talk about these changes, when they're more important than anything any president has said since George W Bush's invasion of Iraq.

BR-Technicals;1531174124;8xgv7t;;9;;0;"# The Market Environment July 2018

### Key Points

* Unemployment ticked up to 4&amp;#37;, but in a positive way for the economy and investors.
* Stocks are still bullish after breaking out in May.
* However, there is weakness in underlying trends.
* Are treasuries pointing to a market downturn?

Unemployment rose in June, but not because people are losing their jobs. In fact, the economy added 213K jobs last month. Unemployment ticked up because there is a larger pool of people entering the workforce.

This is good news for investors because it means there is more slack in the economy than previously thought. With more slack, the Federal Reserve is less likely to hike interest rates at a faster pace, relieving investor anxiety.

## The Dow Jones Industrial Average

The index is weak compared to other major averages. Trade disputes and tariffs are likely worrying investors of an impending slow down in economic and investment growth. 

The index has broken two major levels: the solid green trend line, and the 200-day moving average. Plus, breadth analysis shows that only half of the stocks in the index are above their 50-day moving average. Weak breadth and broken supports are signals that the index may continue to fall.

However, not all hope is lost. The green dashed line on the chart above may be a new support. This support could be the one that investors are paying attention to, and it also helps support our Dow Theory analysis. 

Dow Theory – the idea that the transportation average leads the industrial average – gives us a positive sign too. The transportation average has found support at its trend line, and if it holds, it could signal a recover in the industrial average. 

## Interest Rates May Signal A Top in Stocks

This is a chart comparing the 10-year treasury and the S&amp;P 500. The red vertical lines are points where yields peak, while the green ones are where yields bottomed. These lines show that treasury yields tend to lead the stock market.

Now, focus your attention on the solid red lines. These lines precede the market tops in 2000 and 2007. Each time, treasury yields reached a high near the trend line, and dropped. A few weeks later, a bear market formed in stocks.

Right now, interest rates are in a similar situation. They have peaked at the trend line, and everything points to them falling. If we see a dramatic shift in yields, we may see stocks fall next.

But those who still do not know what the stock is about, who leave the stock, where to leave, why are the discounts - that is, they do not have much idea about the stock item, mainly because of their targets, they write this article.

Suppose, I used to store my own savings for a few years and opened a shop named FC (Rifat Fried Chicken). For any reason, my shop has been exposed. There was a review of my shop food on the foodbank. People started coming from far and away, for my shop's fried chicken meal.

So in a while I realized that my business condition is good and even bigger, the future of business is excellent. But the problem is that there are so many people coming in. I have no place to put them together. Some people are returning after seeing the crowd and [**gold price**](http://www.mcxsuregain.com)**.** If I could take a little more space or if I could make the store from one store to two storied, then I could have taken a lot of pressure from the customer.

**Checkout more:** [**http://www.mcxsuregain.com/**](http://www.mcxsuregain.com/) 

Simple thing, my business needs to expand a bit more. But there was a small problem here. I have poured all the money in my savings, behind this business. The amount of profits in hand is not enough to bring the business to more coverage. What can be done now?

Many options will now come to my mind. Maybe I can borrow from someone I know. But if I do not have any wealthy people, then I can not do it. Banks can also take loans with interest. It may also be that maybe some of my closest friends, who had the desire to work together with me, from the childhood - I can tell them to go down the business with me. All of them invest money in my business and in return I give them some portion of the ownership of my business. I went to friends and got five to six people who agreed to enter the business.

The problem is the money problem. My store was one-to-two storey, I worked a lot of interior decorations and did a great job. Without adding chicken fries I added more food items to the menu. People liked them too. Within four to five years my restaurant became a brand.

Now my target is sky sky. I made plans to open my restaurant branch in more than six places in Dhaka. Here is the same problem. The dream is very big, but to fulfill it, the money that we need to meet is not worth it all. So what can be done now?

Again, like the previous times, many options are in our hands. Suppose, I used to adopt the procedure just like before. Now, many people have the opportunity to invest in my business. In exchange, one portion of my restaurant will be given to each of them - this was the condition. My business partner grew, I got my money and spread my business to a bigger extent.

The main idea of ​​the stock is actually that.

Stock is basically the investment of a company's business and the way to become the owner of a portion of the company. If I did not buy a Facebook stock, then I became one of the many owners of Facebook. Stock is a very big way to make money investing in a trading or stock market. I bought a company's stock every 100 taka. After a few days maybe it increased to 200 rupees. If I can sell it in my mind, then I can sell that stock or stock to someone else. Then my profit will be 100 rupees per stock. The market where this business is called is called the stock exchange.";131476;Financial stock market analysis;

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Source: [Fintel.io/insiders](https://fintel.io/insiders)";132580;Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days);
badpauly;1531687474;8z4v8p;;0;;6;"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

Support levels, micro(15,30,1hr,4hr) and macro(daily,weekly, monthly, yearly).

Resistance levels, micro and macro(same as above).

Trend(is it bullish, bearish or currently consolidating)? 

• Make sure to look at micro and macro scales


Mental stoploss (should be near the bottom support level on the trend that you are looking at).

Candlesticks (what are they telling you?)

Volume(is there alot of liquid in the stock?)

Float(how many shares are available to trade of that stock?)

Short intrest(how many shares are soldshort, is a shortsqueeze possible, why/why not?)

Moving averages(where is the stock in relation to these averages?)

RSI (is it overbought or oversold?)

Patterns (do you notice any bullish or bearish patterns?)

Fundamentals – can be found at finviz.com 
1.PricetoEarningsRatio(P/E)

• Use within same sector to compare companies, compare it to the average PE of the sector

• “What you pay for 1$ of company earnings”

• Want the PE BELOW sector average.

2. Price to Book Ratio(P/B) 

• If the PB is less or equal to 1 (1&gt;x), the stock is trading at/below the value of its assets.

• If the PB is greater than or equal to 1 (1&lt;x), the stock is trading at/above the value of its assets.

• Use this to compare companies within the same sector

• Current share value ($) / (equity/share)

3. Price to Earnings to Growth(PEG)

• Good to use on a company with rapid growth

• If PEG is less than or equal to 1 (1&gt;x), company is undervalued.

• If PEG is greater than or equal to 1 (1&lt;x), the company might be overvalued.

4. Return of Equity (ROE)

• “how well a company generates earnings”

• 17-20% = very good

• 20-25% = excellent

• 25%+ = superior

5. Debt to Equity Ratio

• Try to avoid companies that have a ratio greater than 2.

6. Current Ratio

• “the ability to pay short term and long term debt”

• x&gt;1 = liability &gt; assets

• x&lt;1 = liability &lt; assets

• x&gt;3 = holding back

7. SEC Filings

• File 4 = acquired/disposed of shares by insiders

• File 8/10K, looking for management optimistic/bullish

Financials

1. IncomeStatement (Revenues &amp; Expenses,P&amp;L)

• Revenue = driven by price and quantity of the product sold.

• Costs of goods sold = price of labor, materials, etc.

• General and Administrative Costs = price of sales people, utilities or rent).

• that takes you down to operating profit or EBIT

• from there you subtract out your interest expenses (amount of interest you pay for debt) and your taxes (companies have an effective tax rate) to get to your 'Net Income'

• Financial institutions like to look at a metric called EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation &amp; Amortization) which is a semi proxy for free cash flow

• its essentially your operating earnings adding back Depreciation and Amortization which are non cash expenses

• Depreciation (think of buildings, you have a building worth $100 and you depreciate it over 5 years so goes down by $20 every year but its not a true expense so you add it back

• Amortization is for intangibles think like Intellectual Property

2. BalanceSheet(Financial position at a given point in time)

• Balance Sheet (financial position at point in time). Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

• That's the very definition

• On the Assets side, you have Cash and equivalents (could be short-term treasuries that you can convert to cash pretty quickly usually within a year), Accounts Receivable (what a client owes you in credit), Inventory, PP&amp;E (think like machinery for industrial companies). Liabilities is primarily A/P (what you owe ), Debt, both short and long term among others

• then Owner's equity is Common Stock, Retained Earnings (Net Income - Dividends paid to date) flows from Net Income on income statement

3. Cash Flow Statement(cash flow from operations, financing and operations)

• Cash Flow Statement, 3 main ones are Cash Flow from Operations (pretty straightforward what this means, day-to-day cash outflows/inflows)

• Cash Flow from Investing (CapEX is the big one here, represents purchase and sale of equipment, plant, properties, etc.) also outflows from acquisitions or inflows from sales show up here • Cash Flow from Financing is how the company raises money, you issue stock, you issue debt, and you get money

• companies can also repurchase their stock to lower number of shares outstanding, shows confidence in the stock";132603;Here is a cheat sheet I made for analyzing stocks technically, fundamentally and financially. Enjoy;

## Key Points

* China is the world’s second largest economy after they had their own industrial revolution.
*  The economy is run by the government through their “5-Year Plans.”
* Chinese stocks may be signaling a slowdown in the economy, which could put the global economy in trouble.
* The Renminbi is weakening, which is likely a trade war tactic by the Chinese government. 

## An Introduction to the Chinese Economy

China is unique compared to the rest of the world’s top economies. It boasts the highest population, the second largest economy, and it is a command economy. Their economy is run by the government, and they have been in charge since 1949.

A command economy needs to be planned by the government. In a capitalist economy, market forces determine what products and ideas fail, and which succeed. In China, the direction of the economy is determined by the heads of the communist party, and they build what is called the 5-Year Plan.

### How China Became a Giant

Around 1980, Chinese manufacturing began to take off. They had a modern day industrial revolution which made China the manufacturing powerhouse it is today. 

There are many possible reasons why China has become the economic force it is today, so fast. Cheap labor, the rise of efficient shipping, and favorable trade deals have all attributed to the Chinese economic gorwth. Today, China’s is the worlds largest manufacturer, and exporter. 

Though the economy relies heavily on manufacturing, that is not the only place where growth is taking place. During this economic boom, China has slowly shifted from a poor rural population into an urban population. 

Through the years, China has accumulated lots of debt to build the infrastructure necessary for a modern economy. With manufacturing bringing people out of poverty, and the government spending on infrastructure, Chinese GDP grew at 10&amp;#37; a year for 3 decades. 

However, debt created growth is not sustainable, and China has directives in their latest 5-Year Plan to deleverage, and strengthen the economy for the future.

Today, China is in their 13th 5-Year Plan (2016-2020). “This 80-chapter, more than 60,000-character document seeks to address China’s ‘unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable growth’ and create a ‘moderately prosperous society in all respects’ through innovative, coordinated, green, open, and inclusive growth.” ([Source](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/The%2013th%20Five-Year%20Plan_Final_2.14.17_Updated%20%28002%29.pdf))

The communist party is committed to adjusting the economy to be sustainable and efficient. The first thing they are addressing is over-leveraging, and shadow banking. This is likely to hurt over the short-term, but in the long-run, it should help grow a stronger, more efficient economy. 

## China's Stock Market

There are two stock markets in China, The Shanghai Stock Exchange, and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

The troubles in Chinese stocks began in August of 2015. The prior year, stocks grew almost 180&amp;#37;. After such a quick rise, the index inevitably lost 50&amp;#37;. In 2016, the Shanghai index tried to make a recovery, and it rose about 37&amp;#37; over two years. The Shenzhen Index remained relatively flat. 

Now, the two indices have broken to bearish levels, and their is likely to be future stock weakness. This could be a signal of a weakening economy. 

Already, Chinese indicators are starting to show some sluggish growth, and some economists are predicting GDP growth under 6.5&amp;#37;. A slowdown in China could hurt the global economy.

## The Trade War

A slowdown in the Chinese economy could be coming at a bad time, considering the trade war with the U.S. As the world’s largest exporter, China relies heavily on exports to the U.S. A trade war with the U.S. is going to hurt their top industry in their top market. 

However, they are setting up their markets to help ease the pain of tariffs. Most notably, they are letting their currency plunge. 

A weak currency relative to the U.S. Dollar, or any currency, makes domestic goods more competitive. Also, businesses that export to China, lose revenue. This is because they sell the goods in the weak currency and exchange the revenue back to the strong currency. 

All things being equal, companies either lose revenue because they have to keep prices the same, so they get less when they exchange the revenue, or they lose revenue because they raise prices to maintain their margins, but end up selling less because of supply and demand. 

This gives them a negotiation tool, and a trade war tool. If Trump and China decide to continue the trade war, they can continue to let their currency depreciate. 

This makes them more competitive domestically, and it will likely hurt U.S. exporters. Otherwise, they can use the depreciation as part of a negotiation, where they can prop up the currency in exchange for less tariffs. 

## What U.S. Investors Should Watch

China is a global powerhouse, and without their strength during the Financial Crisis, the world economy could still be in shambles. Now that China is focusing on sustainable, long-term growth, their economy is likely to slowdown, and it could mean trouble for the global economy. Industrial commodities such as concrete, steel, and copper, could take a hit if China demands less. 

Investors also need to watch their emerging markets holdings. China makes up about 30&amp;#37; of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. As we have seen in the charts above, Chinese stocks are struggling this year, and they are a drag on emerging market holdings. If Chinese stocks keep falling, we may see emerging market funds struggle too.

Lastly, the most important thing to watch could be the trade war. China is a big market to U.S. companies, and the depreciating Renminbi, tariffs, and weakening economy can all play big roles in large cap stock balance sheets.  

## Conclusion

We should expect a slowdown, or at least weakness, in the Chinese economy. Their current 5-Year Plan is trying to clean up the economy as it deleverages debt, and focuses on sustainability and economic inclusion. Chinese stocks may be showing similar sentiment.

A trade war could exasperate the slowdown, but they are not going down without a fight. This could be seen by the lack of intervention in their currency. A weak currency will hurt U.S. exporters to China, and this can be used as a negotiation tool.

However, a slowdown in China, is not likely to be contained. It could spread to other economies, and ultimately, it could cause a global slow-down. U.S. investors need to pay attention to China and the trade war to fully understand the risks for companies that rely on Chinese consumers for growth.

[http://rpubs.com/nvest\_ai/china](http://rpubs.com/nvest_ai/china)

My take away is that financial conditions in China are still very tight, with small and medium banks trading very poorly. Its also interesting to see the heavy machinery stocks trading poorly (although the trend is still up) given the amazing order numbers most are posting (excavator sales were up &gt;100&amp;#37; in 2017 and up &gt; 50&amp;#37; in 2018). Most importantly the ramp up in property stocks, especially the levered ones line Sunac and Evergrand seem to be coming down. I wonder if it has anything to do with HNA's founder death, which seemed to get very little coverage in western media.

For most westerners, the Chinese stock market is a mystery. For one, the Shanghai market has remained closed to foreigners for many years and only recently opened up via the HK connect. And its well known that the investor base in China is often overwhelmed with retail 'hot money' flows into momentum stocks and fads. That said, the Chinese stock market is still a big one and there are more and more institutional investors getting involved, so prices discovery is becoming more like western markets.

There are too many parameters to fit into[ one blog](https://www.agrud.com/blogs) that might help you understand and analyze the market. Even after years of research, you will still have topics left to learn. 

After spending a lot of time and money on research, investment analysts and advisors are always looking for strategies which will outperform the market sentiments at any given period of time. Most of the sectors failed to outperform the [S&amp;P500 index's performance](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/markets_sectors/sectors/si_performance.jhtml?tab=siperformance) except for Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, Financials, and Information Technology sector. 

So, if the experts and fund managers cannot beat the market sentiments, what are the odds of us beating the market? 

Well, even when things seem to go south, there are a few investment techniques backed by research and also time-tested which tends to outperform the market sentiments. They might prove to be a good investment and generate consistent incomes. 

1. [Stocks paying dividends](https://www.agrud.com/analytics/us-equities/sp500-highest-dividend-yield) tend to outperform the market: A study by Ned Davis Research found that dividend-paying stocks tend to give better returns and beat the market sentiment over a longer period of time than stocks who don't pay dividends. 

Stocks in S&amp;P500 that did not pay dividends gave a 2.5% annual return from 1972 through 2015 whereas a dividend-paying stock gained 7.4% annually. 

2. Stocks buy-back plans also tend to outperform: Companies that repurchase their own shares generally generates higher returns. As a company buys back its own shares the outstanding shares goes down resulting in an increase in a value of its own shares even if there is not enough income. 

On May 1, Apple announced a buy-back program to repurchase stocks worth $100 billion. The stock price was $169.10 during close on that day and the prices surged by 10.02% to $186.05 within a week and were up by 12.59% by the last trading day. 

3. Buy and Hold strategy: Research shows that buying a stock and holding it for a longer stretch of time is one of the best ways to make money in the long run as well as it is a low-risk strategy. An Oppenheimer study shows that S&amp;P500 never lost in the long run over a 20 year period of time back till 1950 whereas lost 16 times in the short run. 

A research by Morningstar shows that if any person invested in any in 30 of the biggest rallied days in the stock market, he would have made 1/5th of the money than the person who held in throughout. 

4. Dividend Reinvestment: Dividend reinvestment will help you in the compound growth. When you reinvest your dividend to buy more shares, you eventually end up owning more shares that will generate more dividends. 

I’m not some investment mogul or expert, but someone just like you. Even though no strategies can give you guaranteed returns, these sets of strategies generally outperform the market. In short, you might try identifying companies that provide dividends and has regular buy-back plans. Hold your stock for a longer period of time and try reinvesting your dividends. Patience might give you a great reward after a long run. ";133566;It’s time to beat the market;

**Space-designed, light-weight carbon fiber is coming to drone racing and, soon, commercial drones and electric vehicles**

July 19, 2018 10:31 AM Eastern Daylight Time

CAMPBELL, Calif.--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--[KULR Technology Corp](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kulrtechnology.com%2F&amp;esheet=51839858&amp;newsitemid=20180719005532&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=KULR+Technology+Corp&amp;index=1&amp;md5=a1b5f17e2beb6734811fde63e869624a), a subsidiary of KT High-Tech Marketing Inc.

&gt;KULR to Serve as Technology Advisor to High-Performance Drone Racing Organization, DR1 Racing. KULR's space-designed, light-weight carbon fiber is coming to drone racing, commercial drones and electric vehicles. #drones #droneracing @DR1Racing  
[Tweet this](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180719005532/en/KULR-Technology-Serve-Technology-Advisor-High-Performance-Drone#)

As the league’s Technical Advisor, KULR will work with drone designers, engineers, and pilots to deploy the company’s space-used and NASA-developed carbon fiber technology – helping DR1 push technical boundaries in speed, weight, and safety.

“We’re excited by this partnership,” said KULR’s CEO Michael Mo. “The DR1 league is already skirting the very limits of drone and electric vehicle performance and, with our space-flight carbon fiber, together we can do some things that will really blow people away.”

KULR’s core technology is a vertically-aligned carbon fiber material that is lighter, more flexible and more efficient than traditional thermal management products. The fiber solutions replace legacy cooling options such as fans, metal plates and liquid pump systems – things that don’t work too well on racing drones. KULR’s cooling systems can be used to cool drone cameras, fast quadrotors and batteries. The combined uses of the KULR fiber in dissipating heat from sensitive components and reducing the risks associated with battery failure will help make DR1’s racing drones faster and safer.

“Together we’re going to make DR1 drones into remote-piloted lightning,” Mo said. “But it’s not just about racing and winning – there will be a ton of testing, learning and innovating along the way,” he said.

That’s a familiar pattern. Just as innovations in high-performance IndyCar racing spawned [many advances](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fid%2F43074652%2Fns%2Fbusiness-autos%2Ft%2Ftop-indycar-technologies%2F%23.WyLbxadKjIU&amp;esheet=51839858&amp;newsitemid=20180719005532&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=many+advances&amp;index=3&amp;md5=dd91fd7ca6120e5f97bc6482c6074e34) in consumer automotive design and safety, technology solutions pioneered and tested through the KULR/DR1 partnership will eventually improve the safety and efficiency of many products such as electric cars, robotics, commercial drones, and millions of consumer electronics.

“It’s going to be a great, high-impact partnership,” DR1 Founder and CEO Brad Foxhoven said. “We want every crumb of power, speed, agility and ability from our racing drones and, with KULR Technology on board as our Technology Advisors, we’re absolutely going to get that – improving the sport, the fan experience and the technology in the process.”

DR1 has previously held races around the world and sealed television and sponsorship agreements with CBS, Fox Sports, DHL, Mountain Dew and others.

This chart shows that the five largest S&amp;P 500 stocks have a market capitalization equal to the bottom 282 S&amp;P 500 stocks. This turned out to be something of a Rorschach test, which was not my intention. I just thought it was a powerful visual. I wasn’t really trying to make a point, certainly not the point that many thought I was going for.

The reason I made that chart was because I was working on this post today, which will  attempt to show that there are plenty of other stocks outside of FAANG that are doing just fine. That tweet had the opposite effect. Hopefully this will remedy that.

The chart below shows the average returns of S&amp;P 500 stocks year-to-date broken down by market cap decile. The first decile is the 50 largest stocks, the second decile is the next 50 largest stocks, and so on. You can plainly see that while the mega caps are performing well, and powering the index higher, there are other stocks that are doing just fine. The 4th, 6th, and 7th deciles are performing better than the 2nd and 3rd.

It is pretty wild to think that the five largest stocks are as large as the bottom 282 S&amp;P 500 stocks, but the truth is, this is how a cap weighted index works. Yum! Brands can triple and it still would not move the needle of the index as much as if Apple gains 1%.

We are not in uncharted territory. The Pareto Principle is a feature of financial markets, not a bug.

Back when I was actively trading I used the weekends to really delve deep down into companies that were on my radar for the week ahead, going over the charts, financials, you name it.

It was really nice having the weekends to do all of this without the thought in the back of my mind that the market was open and I felt like I was missing out on something. I could really take all the time that I needed and not feel rushed.

I don't do much of this nowadays anymore as I'm not actively trading. But, for those of you who are either starting out or have been in the game for a long time should definitely be using the weekends to do the extra DD if you will.

Anyway, I just thought it'd be super cool to see what people are looking at on the weekends for the trading week ahead.

To make this thread meaningful, I think it would be helpful for people to post what they eyeing this weekend, and also include a brief rationale as to why a particular stock has got your interest (is there an upcoming ER due out?, chart setup you like?, etc.) so just kind of exchanging thoughts and ideas with the r/StockMarket community.

It does not matter if it's T/A or F/A, everything is welcome here!

So, w/o getting into further ado let's hear what stocks r/StockMarket has got on their radar this weekend for the upcoming trading week ahead.

Looking forward to hearing some good input in here this weekend.";134287;What stocks are you looking at this weekend?;

“Look at this,” Simpson said, motioning around the company’s headquarters, which take up a good chunk of a business park out on Northeast Airport Way. “We have 163 employees in Oregon. We support Oregon farms. We create jobs for Oregon. I’m a proud Oregonian. I take that personally.”

It’s a point of some sensitivity as more Oregon cannabis companies, looking for the capitalization needed to survive a sector overcrowded throughout the supply chain, https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2018/07/16/canadian-company-spends-millions-acquiring-oregon.html turn to the Canadian public markets

Simpson was ahead of the curve there, https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2017/03/23/a-big-pot-deal-golden-leaf-holdings-says-its.html striking a deal to sell his company Chalice Farms— with cultivation and processing facilities and four retail outlets — to Golden Leaf Holdings in March 2017.

The deal, though, brought more baggage than riches, Simpson said, and the year-plus since hasn’t been easy. There have been massive losses and http://thecse.com/en/listings/diversified-industries/golden-leaf-holdings-ltd"" the company’s stock is wallowing in the teens — in cents, not dollars.

But Simpson is confident that the company is now positioned to succeed, cleaned up and with the right strategy in place: vertically integrated operations in Oregon, California, Nevada and Canada, coupled with a novel plan to franchise Chalice Farms outlets everywhere pot is and becomes legal.

“We’re super-penalized and undervalued right now thanks to the old regime,” Simpson said. “It’s going to take multiple quarters to prove what our true value is. But in a year or two or three, it’s going to be a very different story.”

Put in charge

Though it wasn’t his plan, he said, within weeks of the Golden-Chalice deal closing, Simpson became the CEO. (One of the first things he did was announce that the company’s manufacturing, operations, sales, marketing and finance functions would be at the Chalice Farms headquarters in Portland. Sorry, Canada.) 

The reason the new board put him in charge, Simpson said: “It turned out that Golden needed to buy our company to stay afloat. They needed the new story, the Chalice pieces, to go out and raise funds.” 

Facing a cash crunch, Simpson, 38, took on that task, raising more than $33.5 million.

“Now we’re in a really good cash position,” he said.

Despite losing $56.1 million on revenue of $11.5 million in 2017, the company reported it had more than $20 million on hand as of the end of April.

“We’re in a really good position to do the things we want to do,” Simpson said.

One ambition is to continue to expand its sleek, Apple-store-like retail fleet, which now numbers seven.

Simpson thinks Oregon’s market is overpopulated with retailers, believing the current 500-plus shops will dwindle to 250 or so. But he wants a bigger share, and he’s not the only one.

“Chalice, along with Nectar and you can throw in La Mota there, feel like they can succeed where others aren’t as they develop supply chains and lower their cost structure,” said Beau Whitney, who worked for Golden Leaf before the Chalice deal and is now a senior economist at New Frontier Data, a cannabis industry analytics and consulting firm based in Washington, D.C.

Whitney believes superior supply-chain management, scale and branding will define who wins and loses, both locally and nationally.

“Supply-chain management is huge,” Simpson agreed. To make the point, he highlight the company’s new cannabis-infused fruit chews under the company's Golden label. They’re vegan and “wholesome,” Simpson said, and a 10-pack goes for $14 at retail.

The company is making about 9,000 a day in Portland, but has held off on pursuing new accounts because Simpson wants to be sure to be able to supply the current clients.

“If you go to market with something and people love it — and they love this product — and they want more, if you can’t fulfill behind it, that’s a big problem,” he said.

As part of a ramp-up, the company is about to open a big new CO2 extraction operation at its Portland headquarters, an investment of more than $2 million that will give Golden Leaf the ability to meet 20 percent of the demand for cannabis oil in Oregon, Simpson said.

“We’re perfecting the model here in a very competitive, consolidating market,” Simpson said. “That gives us a big advantage in California and Nevada.”

Ray Kroc-like

Meanwhile, there are the franchises. Or the idea of franchises, as none yet exist.

The concept was announced in March, and media around the nation found it irresistible. “Canada's Golden Leaf Wants to Carpet the U.S. With Pot Retail Stores,” Bloomberg said, adding that the company was aiming to become “the Starbucks or McDonald’s of weed.”

And that pretty much is the idea.

“We built a franchise offering just like any traditional franchise,” Simpson said. “It’s just that it’s Chalice Farms and it happens to be cannabis.”

The plan is a $50,000 fee for a franchise, and 5 percent of gross revenues.

“The amount of capital that I can raise isn’t going to grow the amount of stores that we want to see Chalice Farms grow,” Simpson said. “The natural evolution for us to expand our brand throughout the United States and internationally is a franchise.”

Other companies have expansion plans, but nobody has struck the franchise chord like Golden Leaf with Chalice Farms.

Brandon Rexroad, founder of Shango Premium Cannabis, said his company is pursuing a different model as it aims to expand. It has a trio of stores in Oregon and is looking forward to growing in California, Michigan, New Jersey and Florida, but is aiming to do so by owning stores, or doing licensing deals for the stores that the parent company, Rexroad Marquis Corp., doesn’t own.

“An issue is if you ever try to roll that up for an exit, there’s a lot more due diligence dealing with the franchises,” he said. “That becomes a big, complicating expense.”

But as Rexroad added, Golden Leaf has an advantage, already being public.

Still, Simpson said not to expect franchises to pop up into Subway-like ubiquity soon.

“We’ve gotten probably 100 inquiries, and we’re doing due diligence,” he said. “We’re going to play it close to the vest early, looking for pilot partners to really get the model in place.”

As for the first location for this not-Canadian company's franchises? They could be in Canada, where BlackShire Capital, which has signed a letter of intent with Golden Leaf to back the venture, is based.

";134289;Oregon cannabis operator pursues franchise model for national expansion;
alexfialfilet;1532188912;90qb8h;;18;;3;"I’ve always been a big fan of Elon Musk. He seems like one of those once in a generation type people. His brilliance has been a large component in $TSLA’s more than doubling in share price over the last five years. 

But as I’ve begun to take a closer look at this company, it becomes more apparent that $TSLA is ripe for a short play. The shares have been down about 10.4% over the last six months, but the downside potential is much greater. 

When you really take a hard look at the earnings power of this business, the economic moat that it has against its competitors, and the current share price, it becomes clear that $TSLA is wildly overvalued. 

The Model 3, for starters, despite claims of robust demand from Musk, have seen 23% refund rate on original deposits (SeekingAlpha) and just 8% configuration rate in April, meaning nearly a quarter of original deposits put down on the car are asking for refunds while less than a tenth of original depositors are putting down the additional money to configure their orders. Combine this with the fact that Tesla is taking months to process refunds and it becomes clear that these orders aren’t turning into actual cars on the street. 

Now Tesla makes a sleek car, and they are certainly technological marvels, but the fact of the matter is that the economic moat that Warren Buffett often looks for in his investments is quickly shrinking here. This is because major car manufacturers both in the US and abroad are investing heavily into electric car technology and Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, and Ford are making a nearly $100 bn investment into EVs through 2030. Batteries are getting cheaper and electronics and motors are becoming more efficiently produced, but Tesla simply cannot ramp up its production capacity fast enough. Let’s also consider that the rare earth materials used in Tesla’s batteries (which, I’ll admit, are by far the most technologically advanced of the industry) are often originated in Africa (an extremely risky market) and, of course, China. Trade war anyone?

Tesla has lofty gross profit margin goals for the future but its hard to imagine the company reaching them, especially as the government begins to phase out its subsidies on buying EVs over the next few years. With all of that being said, investors still want to believe in the magic of Musk and have mostly sustained this $313 valuation. Fundamental analysis would show that these shares can’t be worth even close to that. Only ask the dozens of high level executives who have left the company over the last few years and cashed out their options on the ride up. You would be hard pressed to find a successful company that has seen so much turnover. 

I’m a seller of this business at the current price. I think Tesla is a cool ass company and have really sick cars. But real analysis would support a short. Stack that paper boys!!

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

badpauly;1532284278;90zvcs;;0;;3;"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Summary:  US equities have gained every month since April, and are up over 3% so far in July. Our long term view remains that SPX will make a new all-time high in the months ahead. That is now just 2.5% away.  


The short term is less clear. SPX has gained 3 weeks in a row; most often, these streaks are followed by a higher high without too much interim give back. Sentiment and volatility data mostly supports further gains.  


But, while July is typically a strong month, that strength has often been realized by the end of last week. The rest of the month is usually, at best, flat, and seasonality is typically a head wind in August and September. Right now, that tendency is further supported by weakening breadth momentum.  


Earning data pushes to the forefront this week: 35% of the companies in the S&amp;P will report their 2Q earnings in the next 5 days. The advanced estimate of 2Q GDP will be released Friday.

Toymaker Hasbro's shares soar after revenue and profit top estimates

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/23/toymaker-hasbros-quarterly-revenue-tops-estimates.html

- Hasbro topped Wall Street estimates for profit and revenue in the second quarter.

- The toymaker has emerged from the worst effects of last year's Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy.

- The company's revenue fell 7 percent to $904.5 million in the quarter, but was nearly half the drop that analysts were expecting.

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/23/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-has-hal-calm-fcau--more.html

The toy maker earned 48 cents per share for the second quarter, well above the consensus estimate of 29 cents. Revenue was also well above estimates. The performance came despite a drop in profit and revenue from a year ago due largely to the bankruptcy and liquidation of the Toys R Us chain.

I recently bought NVDA for $242 and saw it going up to $253. I'm new to the stock market and thought it would be a good idea to set a stop limit on $245 to lock in at least some profits in case of major correction (I learned my mistake in February when my portfolio value decreased sharply within 1-2 days). It all was good until today, $7 drop within 10 minutes this morning caused my stop limit order to execute. Stock price reached $243 and then started to raise again, now sitting at $249.

Obviously I took some profit but it was at least twice as low as if there was no such swing this morning.

With that in mind, It looks like US is due for a recession with high interest rates and 105% Debt to GDP. While the Eurozone seems nowhere near it with Dept to GDP at 85% and interest rates at historic lows.

Question is how to play off the situation? Equities seem dangerous everywhere. EU bonds are hardly worth it.

To me it seems like the only possible plays are Short ETF's or Long Term US Bond ETF's (Sadly I can invest in them because of the EU regulation...)

That leaves the only possibility to make some profits from FOREX. Im currently holding a 10k Euro short position (because the difference in central bank policy). But I think that in an event of a Recession the dollar will fall and I should be Long EUR/USD or CHF/USD.

Those are my thoughts. Please leave out yours so I could see someone else's point of view. Any advice would be much appreciated.";135161;Eurozone vs US in an event of a recession. Possible plays?;

Am I missing something? Perhaps it's a mix of personal paranoia (was looking to buy a house) and media hysteria, but this looks pretty bad.

Dodd-Frank Act has already been partially rolled back, with plans to roll it back further. Many of the problems that caused the 2008 crash also appear to have not been fixed. Prices have out paces increases in wages by outlandish amounts (in many regions, but not all). Lenders and Banks want more home sales, and are beginning to budge on things like 0-3% down payments, and now jumbo reverse mortgages.

In Warren Buffett’s 1965 partnership letter, he gave us a glimpse on how to think about capital allocation:

*“The question always is, “How much do I put in number one (ranked by expectation of relative performance) and how much do I put in number eight?” This depends to a great degree on the wideness of the spread between the* ***mathematical expectation*** *of number one versus number eight. It also depends upon the probability that number one could turn in a really poor relative performance. Two securities could have equal mathematical expectations, but one might have .05 chance of performing fifteen percentage points or more worse than the Dow, and the second might have only .01 chance of such performance. The* *wider* ***range of expectation*** *in the first case reduces the desirability of heavy concentration in it.”*";135731;An Effective Capital Allocator - What's your opportunity cost?;

A. Envision your retirement and the time-frame required to get there
B. Be patient
C. Practice mastery over self through discipline

C. Invest in yourself

Pillar One: Remain Long-Term Oriented

“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it … he who doesn’t … pays it.” – Albert Einstein

The first pillar is the most difficult to master and thus the most important. Without a long term orientation the other pillars will falter. For example, if you are 30 years old and plan on retiring at 65, you have 35 years to go. Do not waste your precious time on daily news articles or claims that the “sky is falling.” We have a bias to think that “recent” news is “more valuable” information when in fact this is not the case. Media outlets and brokerages love to generate a buzz because it is good for their business; investors will check-in more frequently and trade more often, two things that hurt your performance. If you allow your long-term bubble to burst, your short-term mindset will take over and produce a plethora of mistakes.

In 35 years you should expect four market crashes. Use each as an opportunity to be more frugal and buy more stocks at a discount. If you are unsure about an individual stock holding during a market collapse, switch your holding with a market index fund during this time. This is based on the premise that individual stocks don’t always recover but markets do. 

The biggest enemy of the average investor is quite often the person in the mirror! Surprisingly, investors don’t lack good ideas and insights, often times we lack the guts to see them through to fruition! We must get out of our own way and allow the power of compounding interest to work its magic. This is easier said than done, however, the investor who will produce the greatest return has a long-term oriented mindset with mastery over self. There is plenty of evidence that shows that increasing your time period of holding a stock is the best way to boost your return. Put simply: more time = more money.

stocktrack4;1532696581;92cbkc;;8;;5;What’s the strategy leading up to this pivotal earnings release Tuesday for iQiYi? I’m trying to decide if I want to add to my position today. Thoughts?;136004;IQ Earnings 7/31 - what’s the strategy?;
alexfialfilet;1532699986;92cqyk;;72;;113;"Obviously, the most talked about news of the week was Facebook’s huge earnings disappointment, which lead to a nearly 19% drop in value for the company’s shares yesterday. With that being said, I’ve seen a lot of people now talking about getting into $FB because it’s now at some sort of discounted price while still being the same solid company. 

I’ve often wondered the same thing in similar positions, whether to get into a good company that had a disappointing earnings report and is now trading at a discount to the previous price. But what I’ve often found, and what I believe to be the case here, is that we should shift our attention to another company in the same sector. After all, in the interconnected world we live in, macroeconomic forces have a huge impact on our investments. 

What I mean is, if you were a buyer of $FB before this earnings release, than you know that the core business you are buying is Facebook’s online advertising services. So instead of getting into $FB at a discount, why not get into a company that has produced a higher quality advertising business! This is not a revolutionary call, but my suggestion right now is to get into $GOOGL. 

As Warren Buffett has said (you see me quoting him a lot here because we should all be investors, not traders), “it is better to get a great company at a fair price than a fair company at a great price”. Facebook is a quality company now being offered at a discount. But if we are investing, than it seems prudent to turn our attention to the far better business at this time.

Alphabet offers EIGHT - count em, eight - platforms that have over a billion users, meaning advertisers have far more diversity of services to choose from to advertise their products. Facebook just has one, or maybe one and a half if you count Instagram. Facebook has warned that profit margins are going to continue to decline through 2020, while Google has shown remarkable stability in getting revenues to outpace costs. Google posted nearly 24% yoy growth in the advertising business in Q2, and, the hardware and cloud services business that is being counted on to drive Google into the future, saw a robust 36.5% yoy improvement. In addition, traffic acquisition costs for Google were down just slightly as a percentage of advertising revenue, even though total costs did rise. 

This may be an opportunity to get into $FB, but I think the real upside play here is in $GOOGL. 

Stack that paper friends.

Since Monday, the stock was on basically a diagonal uptick going into Friday. It had risen from like $3.50 to $6.50 with consistent momentum for four days straight. So it caught my attention.

Friday morning it shot through the roof, then midday, when everything dropped at the same time, AWX went back to $6 where it was when the day started—so I bought 123 shares hoping it would go back up to $7 by end of day.

Little did I know it would shoot all the way to $10 before the markets finally closed. After hours trading was fucking crazy, it shot from $10 all the way to $14 within an hour. From 5-6 o’clock it went from $14 to $18-19

My question is this:  AWX is about to be halted right?

And if they are halted, will it be halted at the opening bell? I want to know if I will have time to sell this shit off before it’s halted. I did not want it to go this high lol. After $14 I was getting pissed because now I feel like that money is going to be locked as soon as Monday opens...

badpauly;1532888833;92wuak;;0;;4;"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

BR-Technicals;1532987305;938el4;;58;;106;"## The FAANG Trade Starts to Crack

### Key Points

* One of the most popular trades in the stock market is showing signs of weakness.
* Luckily, the damage should be contained within the weak stocks.
* Investors should keep an eye on the tech sector.

### What is FAANG?

Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google – the FAANG stocks. Many investors see these stocks as a proxy of the overall stock market. Prior to the recent earnings, these companies were worth about $3.5 trillion. The S&amp;P 500 has a total market capitalization of $23 trillion, so  FAANG makes up an eighth of the index.

These stocks became famous in 2015/2016. During this time, the S&amp;P 500 and other major stock indices were volatile. However, while many stocks were falling, the FAANG stocks were supporting the markets. These stocks helped prevent further losses in the major indices.

Since, this group of stocks have become famous. The FAANG trade has been a great buy over the last several years, and since, the trade has become very crowded. “The five stocks together have been the most crowded trade for the past six months, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of institutional investors in July.” ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/worlds-most-crowded-stocks-fang-burns-investors-in-q2-earnings.html))

Right now, only a couple companies are showing signs of weakness, mainly Facebook and Netflix. In this blog, we will analyze FAANG, and determine whether the stocks are still an important asset to the stock market and what they are saying about the economy.

## Apple

Apple (AAPL) is the largest company but it has not reported 2nd quarter earnings. We will start with them. 

AAPL has been in a channel since it gapped a resistance around $127. Since the breakout, the stock has moved from $127 to Friday’s close of $190.98, a rise of nearly 50%. 

The stock is currently sitting near the top of the channel. The important price zones are outside of the channel. When earnings are released, we will want to watch for the price to break below or above the channel. A buy signal would occur upon an upwards breakout. A sell signal would occur if the stock breaks below the channel support line. Because the sell signal is so far away, now may not be a great time to open a position.

With Apple currently sitting at a $938 billion market capitalization, it is really close to becoming the first trillion dollar company. A good earnings report could propel the stock to the history making valuation. 

## Amazon

Next in market capitalization is Amazon (AMZN). After a good earnings report, the stock moved slightly upwards. Other market forces likely played a role as the NASDAQ Composite fell more than 1.4% on Friday. 

The stock has been in an uptrend since it bottomed in 2001, after the dot com bubble popped. Over the last 17 years the stock has moved from $6 to $1,817.27 on Friday’s close. This long term uptrend has been impressive as the stock has gained 30,187% over these 17 years.

The stock has recently broke a minor resistance at $1,600, and it seems poised to continue climbing. Right now, the important levels to look out for are the $1,600 support, and the green dashed uptrend line. A break of either of these would be a sell signal. 

While the stock has performed very well, there is a risk that it is a bubble. The stock has an extremely high P/E ratio, greater the 225. The stock is priced rather high, and it is because so many investors believe this is the company of the future.  The problem is that there are going to be more economic hardships before it gets to that point, so pricing the stock so high may be a mistake. At this point, it may be best to wait for a large downturn in the stock, before buying it at these elevated levels. 

## Alphabet

The third largest company is Alphabet (Google, GOOGL). The company has become what investors imagine Amazon can become. It has changed the way every person interacts within society, and the world. It has shaped the internet into what it is today, and continues to be a driver of innovation and technology.

The stock has essentially been in an uptrend since its IPO, only taking a minor dip during the Financial Crisis. Compared to Amazon, the company is a much better value. The P/E ratio is 53, which is still high, but investors are still expecting future earnings growth. 

The stock has been in a minor channel for the last three years, and is currently sitting at the top of it. In addition, the MACD and RSI are also sitting at elevated levels, so the stock could be ready to sell off soon. 

However, the stock and company earnings still look bullish, so the stock is likely to remain within the channel. Given the current status of the stock, it may be best to wait until the stock falls back towards the bottom of the channel, before purchasing.

## Facebook

Facebook comes in fourth, in terms of market capitalization. After the company released earnings on Wednesday, the stock fell around 20% losing nearly $120 billion in market value. This was the largest drop of market cap. value in a single day, in U.S. stock market history.

After the giant drop, the stock may be sitting at a good place to buy. The 20% drop brought the stock down to its uptrend line, or the bottom of the channel. 

This is a great place to buy because the sell signal is close by. So, if you believe the company and stock can make a comeback, this is a great place to add the stock to your portfolio. Your stop should be placed just below the trend line. 

Before you buy though, you will want to be believe the stock can indeed make a comeback. Continual selling pressure could continue to scare other investors into selling their positions, so the stock could remain volatile. 

After seeing the results of Twitter, the social media space could be wavering, and these companies may not be as strong as investors once thought.

## Netflix

Lastly, we look at Netflix (NFLX). The stock was the first of the FAANGs to release earnings, and it was disappointing. Many investors feared that it could be a sign of a spillover, and the rest of the FAANG members could see weakness as well. 

The stock has fallen more than 11% since it released earnings on July 16th. The stock recently broke above an upward sloping resistance line, at the beginning of 2018. 

This line has now turned into a support. If the stock continues to fall, the support level could become important. Investors should look to open a position closer to that support line because the sell signal should be placed just below it. 

## What Happened to Facebook and Netflix?

Netflix and Facebook left investors disappointed after their earnings reports. In Netflix’s case, they aren’t gaining the amount of subscribers investors want to see. 

Netflix has a lot of costs associated with the company. Producing their own content and scaling the business across the world is extremely expensive, so investors wanted to see high subscriber growth to combat against those costs. 

Facebook on the other hand, lost revenue  from a lack of ad sales. It seems that the recent changes in European Union law, and the recent data scandal with Data Analytica have had large affects on the company. Also, both companies project weaker growth in the coming quarters.

## Is the Economy at Fault?

So are the issues of Netflix and Facebook tied to the economy? Facebook’s worries are likely to be contained within Facebook. While new laws and regulations are hurting the company right now, eventually the company is likely to comeback. 

With 2 billion users across the globe, companies are going to want to advertise on their platform. Once Facebook can bring the level of security it requires, and users begin to trust them again, advertisers will start to use the company again. If it were truly a sign of economic weakness, then Alphabet (Google) would have shown weak advertising earnings as well.

Netflix may be a little different. Investors were upset because they missed subscriber growth targets. This could be due to the economic slow downs across the globe, relative to the U.S. economy. International economies are weaker than many people thought in 2017, and that could be a reason subscriber growth weakened the last quarter.

## Is the Stock Market in Jeopardy?

First, only two out of five stocks are hurting. Plus, they are the smallest stocks, in terms of market capitalization. Neither stock is positioned badly, and it wouldn’t be a surprise if they started to move up again. 

Secondly, the market relies on these stocks a lot less now. Index breadth is high. More than 64% of the Nasdaq 100 is above their 50-day moving averages while the S&amp;P 500 is at 67% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is at 87%. The stock market is much more robust compared to the time when FAANG was a major support. 

Investors do need to pay attention to the crowded technology sector however. While the sector has been a great performer, we are starting to see not all companies can keep up with Wall Street expectations.

A crowded trade means that prices can move swiftly. It may not be a bad idea to loosen some exposure to the sector while some stocks are at all-time highs. 

## Conclusion

FAANG has become a household name to most investors because of their stellar performance over the last few years. But, the trade has become crowded as these stocks have become some of the highest holdings in institutional portfolios. 

Now, we are starting to see some cracks in the stock group as Facebook and Netflix missed earnings. The two smallest stocks of the group have had their stocks punished, causing an 11% drop in Netflix stock, and the single largest loss of market capitalization in U.S. stock market history, in Facebook.

Even though these stocks have struggled over the last few days, they are still bullishly positioned on the charts. In fact, at this point, all of the FAANG stocks still look poised to grow. However, this changes if the stocks cross any of the sell points previously mentioned.

The missed earnings reports are also likely to remain contained within the stocks themselves. Facebook had the data scandal to deal with, and Netflix is spending more and more money on content, and failing to gain as many subscribers as expected. If these companies hiccuped because of the economy, we would have likely seen it in Amazon and Alphabet (Google) shares as well. 

Lastly, the overall health of the stock market is not in jeopardy either. There are still plenty of stocks marching the indices higher. Plus, the two smallest FAANG companies are showing weakness. The net drag that they have on the indices is minimal relative to the other companies within FAANG. Right now, Facebook and Netflix are not likely to change the direction of the stock market.

One of the best pieces of stock market advice I ever received was from a man on his deathbed. This man was a former real-estate investor and at the time he was a patient of mine in the intensive care unit:

*Picking individual stocks is for fools!*

I was 22 years old at the time and although I had done a fine job investing for my age group, this man had spent his entire life investing. He found a very successful recipe for himself in which he shared with me.

He asked me if I had ever heard of John Bogle, to which I replied, “yes.”

I had heard of John Bogle. I knew that Bogle was the founder and former CEO of Vanguard Group, a massive investment management firm, but I never studied any of his works.

He told me to read “The Little Book of Common Sense Investing,” and that this book would change my perspective on the market. This was the first time I had been exposed to the “Boglehead” ideology – a term for individuals who stick true to the teachings of John Bogle. He said that many individuals believe they can beat the market by picking their own stocks, however for the average individual, investing in stocks is for fools.

## So if picking stocks is for fools, what should I invest in?

Let me introduce you to the index fund. An index fund is a group of stocks that you can buy as a bundle. By purchasing an index fund, you will own a whole group of stocks. This will protect yourself from some of the risk of picking the wrong stocks. In that index fund, some stocks will go up and some will go down. However, as Bogle has pointed out in his books, the stock market as a whole has always gone up over the long term. This means that if your portfolio (investments) reflects the broader stock market, your investment will grow over a long period of time even as some individual stocks go down.

## How Do You Invest in the Entire Stock Market?

You don’t need to be a millionaire to own the entire stock market. By buying index funds that reflect the S&amp;P 500 (which includes 500 of the largest companies on the stock exchanges), your investments (tax favored or taxable) will track the performance of the greater stock market!

This may sound too simplistic and perhaps a bit boring, but it’s not. Regardless of your investing knowledge or perceived skill level, it is extremely important to have at least a portion of your money in index funds. Why? PROTECTION.📷

Nobody likes to concede to the fact that their hard earned money will achieve solely a market average return, however many individuals lack the temperament and skill to consistently pick winning stocks.

Aside from the fact that stock picking can be difficult, there is also a time factor that comes into play when researching and managing your own money. Many individuals simply do not want to spend their weekends or time off actively researching holdings or potential holdings. This is yet another reason why index funds are important.

## But the Stock Market Doesn’t Always Go Up!

You’re right. There are good times (bull markets) and bad times (bear markets). The S&amp;P 500 index fund not only guarantees you the profits made by the stock market, but the losses, too. In fact, the market cycles through periods of growth and decline.

We are probably due for another bear market as the last one was during the 2008 recession. Don’t freak out and sell everything when it happens. We expect it to happen. Just remember that over a long period of time (say your investment lifetime) the stock market has always grown and things should pick up. Just stick to your investing plan and have confidence that good times are ahead.

You’ll never be able to time the market perfectly, so the best advice is to invest regularly regardless of whether you think we are at the peak or the nadir (all-time low).

## Where Should I Invest My Money?

Like I mentioned earlier, a portion (at least your first $10,000) should be invested into index funds, and should be contributed to bi-weekly or monthly (most workplaces offer this plan). Doing so will provide you a stable foundation for your investments and somewhat of a security blanket in case some of your higher risk investments don’t pan out as planned.

Where should you invest the remainder of your money? Well, this is highly dependent on your age, level of investing knowledge, and overall comfort level. There is no right or wrong asset class to invest in, whether it’s stocks, real estate, collectables and antiques, invest using your strengths.

I personally like researching and analyzing stocks, I find it highly enjoyable. A set portion of my portfolio is allocated into index funds, so I am well protected, however I am not a full blown Boglehead. I firmly believe in taking calculated risks and investing into high quality companies.";137471;INVEST LIKE A BOGLEHEAD;
OptionsGeek;1533046804;93evcp;;4;;1;"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/correction-worse-than-february-is-building-morgan-stanley-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/correction-worse-than-february-is-building-morgan-stanley-says)

The market’s leaders have gone missing this earnings season. For Morgan Stanley, that’s a worrying sign that the stock rally may have exhausted itself.

Despite more than 85 percent of S&amp;P 500 members [beating analyst estimates](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PCOPLLT0AFB6), the type of pro-cyclical companies you’d expect to surge amid banner earnings have been falling behind. Not even the biggest winners of the year are posting reliable gains, as earnings misses from the likes of Netflix Inc. and Facebook Inc. hamper the momentum trade.

As such, risks to the July stock rally are building, and with peaking growth rates and extended positioning, the three-day slide that started Thursday will only get worse, Morgan Stanley analysts said.

“The selling has just begun and this correction will be the biggest since the one we experienced in February,” Morgan Stanley equity strategists led by Mike Wilson wrote in a note Monday. “It could very well have a greater negative impact on the average portfolio if it’s centered on tech, consumer discretionary and small caps, as we expect.”

The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.4 percent on Monday, bringing its three-day slide to 3.8 percent. The measure sank almost 10 percent from a January high through Feb. 8.

Some below-the-surface moves are setting the market up for a bigger downturn. One of the more curious developments since the reporting season began has been lagging value stocks -- those priced cheaply to their assets. Typically, strong earnings reports spur investors to bid up underpriced stocks. However, a market-neutral version of value has tumbled for the past three weeks.

“Maybe this reflects a realization that while the results are great they may also represent a peak,” Sanford C. Bernstein analysts, led by Inigo Fraser Jenkins, wrote in a note Monday. “Analysts covering value stocks are already ‘maxed out’ in terms of their upgrading of earnings forecasts for such names; we struggle to see how they can get even more positive.”

Yet there are some signs that a new leadership could emerge. Value was able to recover some of its losses on Monday, gaining nearly 0.6 percent, the most among 10 factors tracked by Bloomberg. Over the past three days, value has beaten the strategy of chasing winners by 1.8 percentage points, the best outperformance in eight months.

Analysts like JPMorgan’s Marko Kolanovic point to signs of a value rally that would pick up the slack in momentum stocks.

“Some investors fear tech weakness could lead to a much more significant market correction,” Kolanovic wrote in a Monday note. “We point out here that value rallies are historically associated with ‘risk on’ trades.”

Value stocks in a Bloomberg index outperformed growth stocks by 0.7 percentage points Monday, also the most in eight months.

However, the concern goes beyond the day-to-day gains and losses among value stocks. Correlations between all investment factors are on the rise, according to Bernstein, increasing systematic risk for active investors. Linkages may only continue to tighten as the earnings season concludes, as investors pay more attention to global threats.

Not only have same-way factor moves [ailed quantitative funds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-11/equity-quants-reel-from-worst-run-in-8-years-as-aqr-takes-hit) \-- which rely on the diversification benefit of multiple factors -- but rising correlations also make it difficult for fundamental managers to scrub out unwanted factor risk, according to Fraser Jenkins, who recommends reducing active risk.

“With growth becoming less synchronized, correlation on the rise and value no longer representing cyclicality, this is all evidence that we are heading towards a phase when growth will start to slow,” Fraser Jenkins wrote.";137483;Correction Worse Than February Is Looming, Morgan Stanley Says;

avigilburt;1533077695;93jcme;;4;;0;"# Last week, I wrote an article about how I view the potential effects of an economic collapse on American society. Unfortunately, many of our readers took it as an opportunity to post their perspectives on Trump and the democrats.

Yes, I know the country is exceptionally divided. However, I brought this issue to light not because I see one party as being the savior for this country over the other. Rather, I brought this issue to light to show you that we are on a path of history repeating itself, as we have forgotten the lessons learned from the pain of the past.

We all have to recognize that the United States took a big step down that slippery slope of socialism with the passage of The New Deal. Since then, it does not matter which party has been in power, as we have extended those socialistic policies when the masses thought it was “needed.” Thus, each generation since The New Deal has seen expanding socialistic policies. While you can argue whether you approve or disapprove of this progression, to ignore that we are on this path is foolish.

Moreover, the reaction to the financial market shock experienced during the Great Recession has shown us that our government is willing to go further down the path of socialistic policies. So, I really do not have much doubt in my mind that this will be the go-to answer when we get into bigger trouble in the 2030’s no matter who is in power.

But, I digress. The main point of this update is a follow up on my last article to explain the potential that the market still has overhead before we top out in the coming years.

A very [long-term chart on the Dow](https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/scharts/Chart-on-the-Dow-2-Month-201807231857.html), which covers over 100 years, shows why we still think there is upside left in this market in the coming years. However, before we are going to set up for that final run in the early 2020’s, I still think we will see a 20-30% correction begin in 2019.

But, once that 20-30% correction completes, our expectation is that the DOW can reach at least 35,000 on the rally into the mid-2020’s, with a potential blow off top taking us as high as the 66,000 region. In fact, the 66,000 region is the ideal target on the larger degree structure.

While that is quite a large range, much will depend on how that rally takes shape after we complete the expected 20-30% correction. So, it is a bit premature to be able to hone in on the exact target region upon which to focus. But, as noted, our minimal expectation at this time is the 35,000 region, whereas the ideal target has been 66,000.

So, as you can see, based upon our analysis which has kept us on the correct side of this market for many years, we still believe that this bull market has further to run. However, we are expecting a sizeable correction to begin in 2019 before that last leg of this bull market which began at the 2009 lows takes hold. And, after this last leg into the mid-2020’s completes, then we will likely begin a 10-20 year bear market which can take the DOW back towards the 10,000 region.";137619;How High Will The Market Rally Before The Economic Collapse Begins?;

After watching one post in /r/pennystocks I decided to take a minute position in this stock at about 5 cents. Well I saw an 82% drop on Monday upon news that they haven't found a backer yet, essentially. So many questions

1) How do I set something up to where I can get immediately alerted to news about my stock? I have TD 

2) Is the idea of realizing anything from the liquidation a pipe dream? What are my prospects, do I just dump now? 

3) More conceptually: So what happens to all the money they raised from the stock market? It's all already spent? If not, is there a pool of capital just sitting there that dwindled by 82% on Monday? How can they tap into the cap?

Federal Reserve officials left U.S. interest rates unchanged and stuck with a plan to gradually lift borrowing costs amid “strong” growth that backs bets for a move in September.

Economic activity has been “rising at a strong rate,” and unemployment “has stayed low,” the Federal Open Market Committee said Wednesday in a [statement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PCSNHOT1UM0X) released in Washington. “Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly.”

While leaving rates on hold as expected, the committee said it expects that “further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate” would be consistent with a strong labor market and keeping inflation near the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, repeating language from its June statement.

Stocks and bonds were little changed after the announcement, with the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index down about 0.1 percent and the 10-year Treasury yield at 3 percent at 3:16 p.m. New York time. Odds for a rate hike at the central bank’s Sept. 25-26 meeting held around 80 percent.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is trying to nurture the second longest U.S. expansion on record by slowly reducing the amount of support that monetary policy provides to growth. The economy is riding a tailwind from tax cuts and higher federal spending, though a trade war threatens to dent growth.

The committee described risks to the outlook as “roughly balanced,” and restated that “monetary policy remains accommodative” while leaving the target range for its benchmark policy rate at 1.75 percent to 2 percent.

“There’s a lot of concern that the trade negotiations and the heightened rhetoric surrounding trade negotiations might lead to slower economic activity later in the year,” said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC in Charlotte, North Carolina. “While it certainly looks like it’s all systems are go for another rate hike in September, and another one in December, the text hasn’t been written just yet on that.”

President Donald Trump lashed out at the Fed last month, saying he wasn’t “thrilled” it was raising rates. The comments threw a political cloud over the central bank’s decisions, though economists and investors had widely anticipated Wednesday’s decision to leave rates unchanged.

Most Fed officials in June projected three or four rate hikes for 2018, implying one or two more moves this year.

Policy makers weighed their action against a generally positive backdrop. The U.S. economy grew at a 4.1 percent pace in the second quarter, its fastest pace since 2014. Inflation is close to the Fed’s 2 percent goal, rising at 2.2 percent for the year ending June, while the core rate that excludes food and energy was up 1.9 percent.

The committee noted in the statement that both headline and core inflation “remain near 2 percent.”

Unemployment was 4 percent in June, below the Fed’s 4.5 percent estimate of the level that reflects full employment. The gradual pace of rate increases shows that officials want to see if tight labor markets can continue to draw more people into the workforce and produce higher wages, without sparking unwanted inflation.

Wednesday’s decision was unanimous 8-0. Voting members shifted chairs at this meeting, with John Williams voting for the first time as New York Fed president and FOMC vice chairman, with Kansas City Fed chief Esther George taking his place as an alternate for San Francisco while it seeks a new president.";137873;Fed Leaves Key Rate Unchanged With Economy at ‘Strong Rate’;

Thoughts?";138129;Apple hits 1 Trillion Market Cap;
SwineZero;1533223354;940720;;0;;1;"First of all, thank you for reading and replying. I positively do not know what I am asking. Replying with a link is fine, no need to type it out. If you do write back, I will read everything. No checks for spelling or grammar will ever come from me. I just need brain food.

I placed my questions up front. Some people are not into why a question is asked.

The market opened to triple digit losses, and will recover slowly in the next few hours. Any finance channel or web site has their opposing angle on why the drop and why the recovery.

What part of hype on multiples of real PE eventually works out to make the company show a profit regardless? I am asking if you know of a current tesla that is now profitable without debt.

Where can I see the divide, in real-time if available, between computers and manual trading by people?

Dark markets, trading of books for up to 24 hours? This sounds like lessor casinos and card rooms. Except that there be whales in the dark markets? What are your views on this market?

Is it possible that computer trading applies some sort of discount to a purchase, because there is no hands on transaction and communication?

Again, thank you for you time. I am really interested in this. It's a nice break for world news.

***Level setting my view of the world.***

I read news from outside the USA because it is a better view. I do read small town USA newspapers online.

Almost 80% of Americans say they live from paycheck to paycheck

While jobs are booming, they are whimpering in at contract workers with no job security or affordable family health benefits, and part-time workers within businesses that cannot afford full-time or benefits.

I do not see the same ""America is doing great"" as I do watching or listening to any market reports. Most people saying this are dressed in suits costing more than a weekly paycheck.

The typical American worker now earns around $44,500 a year, not much more than what the typical worker earned in 40 years ago (1978), adjusted for inflation. 

Although the US economy continues to grow, most of the gains have been going to a relatively few top executives of large companies and those that finance them into debt. Corporations will lay off workers instead of lowering top org pay and bonuses that are nowhere near any resemblance of the bulk of their employee's pay. Corporations are beholden to debt and stockholders. 

Think Toys r Us, debt payments from adding cash for stockholder dividend payments and mergers acquiring and breaking up smaller companies for their cash. Nothing to do with toys or the business of toys and they couldn't merger or borrow again to make the debt payment and pay dividends. 

With this dreary view of the world, I am confused about why anyone would buy into hype x times some multiples of basic business facts such as PE. It appears to me that so much money is in the market, that this is the only way to trade more cash?

These are my analogies for this thought: 

Apple, made in China, the same China that steals tech as a matter of culture. Tech is seen as opportunity for everyone. Tech for one is not understood. Apple is near a trillion in market cap. China can nationalize companies of they get pissed enough. 

Tesla operates in huge debt. Debt that would finance hundreds of other companies. The injury rate is higher than any other company in this industry. They keep it down with OSHA by not counting contract employees. Tesla seems t be run by a not so nice person, which nobody reflects to his business running deep in the red. He recently asked for payments returned to show a larger cash balance. Tesla is up today with all of this knowledge in the market.

Is this like Vegas? If you have a little cash, you go to one table, tons af cash, a higher limit table. Same game, same odds. On the books, the casino reports one game, money in money out. 

The little player (the middle class) can lose more and not recover, yet return over and over like insanity. The whale player (corporations) can also get into trouble, and be able to negotiate payment. Whales can get banned, black-booked to lessor casinos and hidden card games. Smaller players already go here.

Investing in the markets; If you have a little cash, you hands on trade from a pc or use a broker. If you have tons of cash, you invest in multiples using computers to keep the pile working and own a brokerage. If the little guy loses, he is wiped out and able to return over and over. If the bigger player loses, he jumps into IVX and uses the computers with discounts on volume to balance his trades in milliseconds of recovery. People here can eventually get banned to lower forms of making money or use dark markets.

Ok, thanks for getting my view on why those questions are important to me.";138143;Questions on market values and PCs running the show v. Human;

A long-running bull market in stocks may be about to enter its final inning.

Morgan Stanley reiterated its cautious view on equities, arguing that a “rolling bear market” wasn’t yet over, and that it could soon impact the parts of the market that have been holding up successfully.

Specifically, the investment bank said that small-capitalization stocks — which have benefited from the uncertainty surrounding trade policy, given [**their high levels of domestic revenue exposure**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-one-factor-has-determined-which-stocks-rise-or-fall-on-trade-war-fears-2018-06-21) — could be about to turn.

Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, said he was “a bit leery about the fact that small caps have become a perceived safe haven in the event of trade conflicts,” and that this “perception may now be overpriced.”

Small-capitalization stocks, as benchmarked by the Russell 2000 index[**RUT,** **+0.77%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/rut?mod=MW_story_quote) , are up 8.9% over the course of 2018. The S&amp;P 500 [**SPX,** **+0.49%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote) is up 5% this year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **-0.03%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote) is up 1.9%.

The Nasdaq Composite Index [**COMP,** **+1.24%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/comp?mod=MW_story_quote) has been the best performer among the major indexes; it’s up 11.8% year to date.

The so-called FAANG stocks — a quintet that refers to Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Netflix, along with Google parent Alphabet [**GOOG,** **+0.50%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goog?mod=MW_story_quote) [**GOOGL,** **+0.66%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl?mod=MW_story_quote)— have by themselves contributed a sizable proportion of the overall market’s gain this year. All five are in either the technology or the consumer-discretionary sectors, and, as Morgan Stanley’s Wilson noted, “within the U.S. market, we have noticed a significant divergence between the perceived weakest links and the stronger ones. From a sector standpoint, it’s really down to just technology and consumer discretionary \[maintaining strength\].”

“Our call was that these groups are likely to get hit next and, indeed, we think a meaningful correction in these asset categories began late last month. The bad news is that these sectors make up almost 40% of the S&amp;P 500 and close to half of the Nasdaq Composite Index, so the correction will leave a mark on the broader U.S. indexes if we’re right.”

He added, “if we are right and U.S. large-cap growth stocks and small-cap stocks finally take their turn in the rolling bear market, we would view it as the final inning of the game we expected this year. Just remember that those last innings can bring a lot of excitement and anguish, too, depending on which team you are rooting for.”

According to Wilson, Morgan Stanley recently sold 25% of its large-cap growth position, rotating that into large-cap value strategies. In addition, the investment bank reduced its small-cap equity holding positions by 30%, putting that into cash equivalents.";138442;Bull market in stocks could be in ‘last innings’ as bears set sights on strongest sectors;

Finally about 2-3 months ago, I bought a small investment of $20 worth of shares in Helios &amp; Matheson (MoviePass) knowing it was a sinking ship but wanted to just get my feet wet with watching how it works, I was fine losing that money. That investment is now worth about about 7 cents lol.

Yesterday I decided to really go for it. and this is where I’d like to start getting some feedback on what I did right, wrong, could do next, should do next, etc. Yearerday, I bought a single share of a number of solid companies: Apple, Hormel Foods, TX instruments, John Deere, Cisco, Disney, Microsoft, Diageo, and Medtronic.

So I bought a single share of each, figuring they’ll all do well in the long term, are relatively safe, won’t make me rich but will likely all bounce back even if the market tumbles. 

Besides being patient with my current investment, was it smart to buy 1 single share of each? Should I have not have invested in these particular names? Is there something else I should look out for to protect myself and/or increase a limo I hold of earning more money? Also, I’d like to continue investing a little bit each paycheck. I have the means to take some cash every other week and buy another share or so. Should I double up on existing shares, keep buying singles of even more time-tested companies?

Apple reached a market value of $1 trillion on Thursday, propelled by the sustained success of the iPhone. WSJ's Spencer Jakab takes a look at how Apple got here.

Critics say: t's just a number. Imagine what Apple could do with leadership and the innovation that seeded the growth and justified the Apple tax. Meanwhile Tim sits nervously on a massive cash-hoard, launching 3 iPhone models simultaneously while sales have been overtaken by Chinese phone-maker Huawei. It's a big boat with huge latency - loyal Apple users are weary and buying alternatives. Once gone, we won't be coming back. Share prices are illusions based on market trading - not on actual value.

On Semiconductor is on track to make about $5-6 billion on the year and is only valued at around $9.5 billion currently. While comparison to Texas Instruments bringing in about $15 billion and valued at $110 billion. 

The P/E is near 10 while the EPS is at 2.14. The consensus target price is at about $26-30. 
My own consensus is near the top end especially weighing in on others in the same game. which would have the P/E be at 15 while TXN is at 28.3.

badpauly;1533496296;94ubmp;;2;;11;"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

badpauly;1533496324;94ubr1;;1;;2;"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

OptionsGeek;1533571138;952huo;;17;;132;"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-06/forget-apple-goldman-says-flagging-new-1-trillion-for-s-p-500](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-06/forget-apple-goldman-says-flagging-new-1-trillion-for-s-p-500)

Investors fixated on one 13-digit milestone last week, Apple Inc.’s value. But another trillion-dollar threshold is in sight and is more relevant to the bull market in U.S. equities, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

It’s the volume of stock buybacks that corporate America is likely to announce this year. The total for S&amp;P 500 firms will jump 46 percent from 2017 to an annual record, according to an increased estimate from the Goldman unit that executes share repurchases for clients.

The new forecast highlights accelerating demand from companies, a sign that any weakness in stocks is likely to be met with unbridled corporate buying. While August has been one of scariest months of the year for equities in the past decade, it’s also the busiest in terms of buybacks, accounting for 13 percent of the annual total.

Now, with more than 80 percent of S&amp;P 500 members done with quarterly financial reporting, most companies can boost discretionary buybacks, concluding a blackout period that typically restricts share repurchases.

“Investors should focus on a different $1 trillion number that will have a key influence on the market: total buyback authorizations,” strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Friday. “It’s not the size of the company but the use of the cash that matters.”

With a year-end forecast of 2,850 for the S&amp;P 500, a level that’s less than 10 points above Friday’s close, Kostin is far from being the biggest bull among [Wall Street strategists](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PB38C4SYF01T) tracked by Bloomberg. Yet he said that the growing alarm around equities, particularly tech stocks, is unwarranted.

At the end of last month, Morgan Stanley’s [Mike Wilson](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/correction-worse-than-february-is-building-morgan-stanley-says) predicted that declines in stocks such as Facebook was a precursor to a correction that would be more painful that the February rout. At the same time, strategists at Bank of America and Credit Suisse sent separate [warnings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/credit-suisse-joins-bofa-in-warning-of-tech-stock-crowding-risk) about the crowding risk in tech stocks, particularly the FAANG bloc of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.

“Our analysis leads to a different conclusion,” Kostin wrote. “Tech is less of a ‘crowded trade” than many investors believe,” he said, adding the firm’s weekly data on hedge fund clients showed 26 percent net exposure to tech stocks. That compared with 25 percent for the broad industry positioning at the end of the first quarter, which declined from levels in 2016 and 2017.

Moreover, there is still untapped buying power left from tech companies themselves. While the sector has announced 40 percent more repurchases this year, their actual buybacks are up at only half the pace.

“By extension, significant potential demand remains for tech shares as firms look to complete their existing programs,” the strategists wrote.";139397;"Forget Apple, Goldman Says, Flagging New $1 Trillion for S&amp;P 500";

BR-Technicals;1533593569;955rp3;;6;;0;"## Key Points

* The S&amp;P 500 is approaching its all-time high, but indicators show weakening momentum.
* Investors are positioning their portfolios defensively as the stock market continues to climb.
* The Dow Jones Industrial Average is still 5% from its high. 

## The S&amp;P 500 is Losing Steam

The S&amp;P 500 is only about 1% away from reaching its all-time high. The index grew more than 4% in July with plenty of corporate earnings reports helping push up stocks. 

Looking at the charts though, we are seeing bearish divergences in the MACD and MFI indicators. These indicate weakening momentum, and we could see a reversal. However, it is important to note these indicators do not necessarily signal a bull market top, but it could point to a minor reversal where the index falls back towards its trend line. 

Volatility may increase during this time, but unless the index breaks the trend line support, this will likely be a regular bull market pullback. The index is currently 5.5% away from the trend line. 

## Sector Positioning

Next we look at sector performance. We use a Relative Rotation chart to look how investors are positioning their portfolios. By looking at the sector positioning, we can infer investor sentiment.  Currently, sector performance is indicating defensive positioning. Over the last few weeks the defensive sectors — utilities, health care, and staples – have been performing strongly. These sectors tend to outperform in volatility and market downturns, so investors move to these sectors when they are concerned with the future.  

## Dow Jones Industrial Average

The blue chips index is nearly 5% away from its all-time high. While the S&amp;P 500 has some help from technology, and the outperformance of the defensive sectors, industrial companies are having a hard time in the face of a trade war. 

While the index has been struggling, a good thing to see is that the price moved back above the long—term trend line, after a little dip below. Similar to the S&amp;P 500, the MACD is showing a negative divergence, but the Money Flow Indicator is not diverging. We remain bullish as long as the index stays above the trend line.

The industrial sector as a whole as been struggling. The XLI industrial sector ETF is more than 5.5% away from its high, and has been volatile. Since reaching its peak, the ETF has fallen by more than 5% five times. 

While it has generally recovered from each fall, this type of volatility could symbolize a top. However, a better explanation could be the trade rhetoric coming from the White House. New threats and increased aggression could be pushing the sector along this roller coaster ride.

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/StockMarket?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, August 7th, 2018! :)**";139712;r/StockMarket Daily Discussion Tuesday - Aug 7th, 2018;
alexfialfilet;1533651731;95c1yd;;11;;2;"As I’m sitting here eating my cereal this morning, I can’t stop thinking about Snapchat. It’s a company that has had reliably negative sentiment and coverage since its disappointing earnings release back in May, and has seen short interest increase about 2% over the last quarter (though you’ve seen short sellers button up positions over the past few days ahead of the release, partially explaining the little bump shares got yesterday). And why shouldn’t it have such negative coverage? The company stated back in May it was lowering its revenue growth guidance for the next quarter amidst slowing ad interest and user growth. Sounds like a dog with fleas, right?

Perhaps. Perhaps not. 

I don’t usually advise speculative trading because it’s usually unprofitable and highly risky. However, so long as you are comfortable losing all of it, and it’s a relatively small sum of money, I actually thinking $SNAP has a lot of short term upside potential. 

Whenever investor sentiment has become universally bullish or bearish on a particular company, you have to ask yourself whether the pendulum has swung too far. In $SNAP’s case, I think it has. Almost every reporter and analyst on the street is expecting a total bust this afternoon when Snapchat releases earnings for this quarter. That gives us a unique buying opportunity. 

We’ve seen other social media giants like $FB and $TWTR take big hits after earnings call this quarter as well. Both cited the newly implemented GDPR as one cause of the revenue slow down, but both also saw a great deal of criticism from users and lawmakers alike because of their roles in data privacy scandals and the Russian misinformation campaign. While Snapchat has not been totally immune to these critiques, or GDPR, the blow to user growth should be much more muted. 

In addition, with expectations so universally low, we really only need a victory at the margins for the sentiment to become positive enough for forward momentum. And there have been some developments to suggest that a an expectations beat is possible. 

For starters, Snapchat is finally in the process of completing its transition to automated advertising sales, a far more efficient process than the manual block ad buys before. Analysts only wanted to discuss a 70% drop in pricing (which really should be viewed positively), ignoring the massive growth in aggregate ad impressions. Advertising is the key here, because the company presents a better value proposition for exposure to millennials and centennials than $FB or $TWTR, both of which are already slowly becoming old news for kids (one survey found 79% of people 13-18 had Snapchat, compared to just over 53% for Facebook). Bringing on VP of finance Tim Stone from Amazon also can’t hurt. 

Don’t take just my word for it. Note 13F filings recording a more than 18% increase in institutional purchases of $SNAP on the open market, as well as more the than 800,000 net shares acquired by company insiders over the past three months. Offering lower guidance while picking up more shares on the cheap? Nice to know the company is bullish. 

In any case. I think $SNAP has some upside potential in the near term. Good trade if you’re willing to take the risk pre earnings, but this is no doubt a speculative move. Warren would not endorse, but you’re playing with house money after y’all burned me on the $TSLA short. 

Stack that paper lads.

arvind1111;1533810138;95v85w;;0;;0;"This chart shows the proprietary CrystalBull Macroeconomic Indicator in relation to the S&amp;P 500, and is updated monthly.  In our opinion, this is our best indicator for the longer term stock market trend.  This algorithm looks for decaying macroeconomic strength, to warn investors of possible stock market weakness ahead.  This market timing model is for long-term investors, who seek to avoid secular bear markets.  Since 1970, following this indicator (in market when above zero, out of market when below) would have beaten a Buy-and-Hold strategy by 647.93%. 

HOW TO USE:  The gold line in the bottom chart represents the CrystalBull Macro Indicator.  It is calculated at the end of each month, based on the currently available economic data.  Values above zero indicate an expected positive stock market trend going forward, and values below zero indicate a possible negative trend going forward.  Click the ""log/lin"" link at the top-left of the S&amp;P500 chart to see the chart at logarithmic scale. A straight line, in a log scale chart represents consistent exponential growth.  Isn't that beautiful?  That's exactly what we hope to find.  This backtested model captured most of the stock market gains, but avoided the bear markets.   Thus, its exponential growth rate is much higher than the buy and hold returns.

OptionsGeek;1533821159;95wexb;;38;;76;"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-08/tesla-take-private-skepticism-grows-after-musk-s-funding-claim](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-08/tesla-take-private-skepticism-grows-after-musk-s-funding-claim)

Wall Street and Washington have the same question for [Elon Musk](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1954518): Where’s the money?

Two days after he vowed on Twitter that he had “funding secured” for a spectacular $82 billion deal to take [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) private, he has offered no evidence to back up the statement. No one has stepped forward publicly -- or privately -- to say they’re behind the plan. People with or close to 15 financial institutions and technology firms who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they weren’t aware of financing having been locked in before Musk’s tweet.

All of which could be problematic as the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13165Z:US) starts investigating the matter. Regulators have asked the company if what Musk tweeted was factual and why such a disclosure was made via social media rather than in a filing, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Judith Burns, an SEC spokeswoman, declined to comment. Tesla also declined to comment.

“When Musk tweeted this, was he saying this was something that was definitely going to happen? Something that might happen?” said Ira Matetsky, a partner at Ganfer &amp; Shore in New York, outlining questions the SEC might ask. “How would a reasonable investor interpret that and was it consistent with the facts as they existed at the time?”

### ‘I Wish’

Tesla fell 0.8 percent to $367.50 in trading before U.S. exchanges opened Thursday -- well below the $420 at which Musk said shareholders would be bought out.

The chief executive officer raised the go-private possibility with the board last week, according to a [statement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PD584M3RXUKG) from six of Tesla’s nine directors. They said he had “addressed the funding for this to occur,” without providing details.

As for Tesla shareholders, Musk said in one of his Twitter posts that [“investor support is confirmed”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PD3VSGAIBMDC) for his plan. The largest shareholders declined to comment. At the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, which as of March owned about 213,000 shares, spokeswoman Michelle Mussuto said there was no advance warning.

“We have not been contacted by Tesla IR,” she said. “They didn’t reach out before the tweet either.”

Leaving the public marketplace isn’t a new vision for Musk, who told Rolling Stone in an interview [published](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-the-architect-of-tomorrow-120850/) in November, “I wish we could be private with Tesla. It actually makes us less efficient to be a public company.”

In April 2017, when Musk held talks with [Masayoshi Son](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1455295) about [SoftBank Group Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9984:JP) investing in the electric carmaker, they touched on the possibility of fulfilling Musk’s wish, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The [talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-08/musk-is-said-to-have-talked-with-softbank-about-tesla-investment) failed to progress due to disagreements over ownership and have not started up again.";140420;Musk Mystery Enters Day 3 as Pressure to Show the Money Mounts;

There are many ETF'S that trade VIX futures.  VIX futures ETF'S do not track the VIX Index however.   They track the futures of the VIX which is much different.  

The problem with VIX futures ETF'S is there is a constant decay in their price.  They use other elements like contango and backwardation to determine their price and direction.

A lot of retail traders get sucked into trying to trade these VIX futures ETF'S like VXX, UVXY, and TVIX.  And a lot of traders lose money trying to trade these ETF'S. 

I personally am not a fan of the VIX futures ETF'S.  I feel they are only good for shorting when the VIX spikes.  I prefer to trade the VIX Index with options which is the only pure play on the Index itself.

I am a stay-at-home mom (I care for a severely disabled adult son full time), but I’ve been looking for a way to generate any amount of income from home for a long time. I’m absolutely fascinated and somewhat obsessed with trading and everything about it.

coquinaa;1534091174;96q8en;;26;;93;"**Week of , August 13th– Swing Trades Watchlist,** **Technical Analysis ONLY**

1.  **ATVI – ACTIVISION**  

o Saw a large drop after earnings report, beat on EPS, very possible an over-reaction (3 day rule), after the drop we saw it hit the 200SMA near 70$, with the dip under that MA being bought, with 2 consecutive green closes after. Good risk/reward in this area.

o Entry would be in the area that it is in now, 70-71, would be small, and would want to scale on the way up if the trend holds.

o Mental stop loss would be under that 200SMA around 69$ (maybe even a tad lower) so that you wouldn’t get shaken out by an MM sweep. If it goes under that 200SMA, I wouldn’t touch it, would wait to see where the floor is.

o Resistances to watch would be 73, 75 (65SMA), 76 (50MA), 80, and then watch for the high break of 82.

o Support to watch is only that 200MA, otherwise I would be a spectator. 

o Will keep this on high watch Monday morning to see what the market does, If I enter it would be SMALL and I would respect the stop loss/mental if it doesn’t work out. Plan your trade accordingly! 

**2.**  **CGC – CANOPY GROWTH**

o One of the many marijuana stocks trying to get a piece of the pie with the upcoming legalization in Canada this fall

o Was only watching this stock because it was getting close to reclaiming that 50SMA (28.75), however on Friday, it hit that 50MA and bounced off, and closed red. 

o Will watch to see what happens around that 50SMA, and ONLY take a position if it can break and hold that 50MA.

o If it were able to re-claim and hold that 50SMA, I would use that area as an entry, and a mental stop loss, similar to ATVI. This is ONLY if it can re-claim that 50SMA. Keep this on watch for the next couple weeks, could see a nice run if it can re-claim that 50SMA to the double top high of 36.50. 

**3.**  **BIDU – BAIDU (“GOOGLE OF CHINA”)**

o This is one of my favorite “expensive” (don’t like that word) stocks that I keep on my watch list. It is finally back in the buying range (look at the 1/2/3 year chart to understand the patterns).

o It is near that support of 220-215 that I have been watching for, played this last time in was in the 220s

o Has seen this drop because of the competition that GOOG could be bringing into China, which BIDU hasn’t faced before.

o Has strong support in the 215-220 range, where 216 was the previous resistance (zoom out and youll see). 

o This is gonna be a high watch for me this week to see what happens, if I enter it will be in this range that it is currently in, with a mental stop loss near the 210-205 range, which if it broke, would tell me that this move is done and it is going back to the old support/resistance (zoom out!).

o Really like the r/R here, potential 15$ loss, for a 60$ gain (resistance is 270-280 (ATH is 284), with a 4/1 ratio. 

**4.**  **TEAM – ATLASSIAN CORP**

o This stock has been a monster recently, up over 100% inless than a year, but don’t let that scare you!

o After the earnings beat, we saw the old resistance (69) obligterated, with the stock hitting a 52 week high of 79.82. 

o Since that we have seen a pullback back into that 69 resistance area, which was then converted into the support area. Therefore the trend is still in tact and I will be watching this closely.

o Ill be specifically watching to see if that 52 week high can be broken, currently at 78$, or if it cant be broken, watching for another pullback towards the 69$ range. 

o If it breaks that 52 week high, watch for the pullback back to the 79-80 range to see if that acts as support

o Most likely will not be entering a position this week, but I think this is a great stock to keep an eye on for the near future and what these next few weeks can bring us. Watch those sup/res levels closely.

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good

BR-Technicals;1534191599;971s8l;;1;;0;"### Key Points

* Sector rotation analysis can provide insight into the current state of the stock market that other analysis can’t.
* Relative Rotation analysis shows investors are positioning themselves defensively as the S&amp;P 500 approaches new all-time highs.
* However, deeper analysis shows that this may be a short-term trend.

Sector rotation can tell us a lot about the stock market. It can give investors insights into trend performance and investor sentiment, but it also can tell investors where they should focus, or more importantly, which areas in the market to avoid.  

## What is Sector Rotation?

First, stocks/companies can be grouped into certain groups called sectors. These companies are usually in the same industry, and they cater to a specific part of the economy. Because they are in the same sector, often times they are direct competitors. 

Sector rotation is the idea that sectors move in and out of favor with investors; i.e., they rotate between under performance and out performance. This occurs because market participants drive stock returns, and when one sector is more in favor, it out performs. 

## What Can Sector Rotation Tell Us?

Stocks prices are based on the future expectation of performance. When investors believe a stock will be higher than it currently is, they purchase it. If they believe the stock will be lower, they sell it. This is what drives sector rotation.

During certain parts of the economic cycle, different sectors tend to perform better than others. For example, when the economy is growing in the middle of the cycle, investors should expect cyclical sectors like the industrials and materials sectors to outperform. 

The companies in these sectors are driving economic growth by creating and providing the necessary resources to produce the final goods and service for consumers. On the other side, when the economy is weakening, investors should look to the defensive sectors. 

These sectors are defensive because they are companies that provide essential services and products such as toilet paper or health care. Consumers need these products and services regardless of the strength of the economy. 

The cyclical sectors, or the sectors that should outperform during economic growth are the industrials, materials, financials, consumer discretionary, energy, and technology. The defensive sectors are the utilities, consumer staples, and health care. 

Sector rotation also tells us about investor sentiment. When we see that defensive sectors are outperforming, it tells us that investors are worried about the future. The defensive sectors tend to be less volatile during times of market volatility. When investors are bullish we see the the more volatile sectors rise faster, and investors position themselves in that way.

In the rest of this blog, we will use sector rotation analysis tools to determine the current state of the stock market, investor positioning, and what it all means. 

## Relative Rotation

The Relative Rotation Graph uses price action to determine sector performance compared to the S&amp;P 500. This graph literally shows how sectors are rotating in and out of favor.  

Currently materials, industrials and financials are in the lagging quadrant in the bottom left, while technology and energy are moving towards it. Consumer staples is the lone sector in the improving quadrant, while health care, utilities, and consumer discretionary are in the leading quadrant.

The current setup of the Relative Rotation Graph is a little concerning. The three defensive sectors are performing better than five cyclical sectors. Only consumer discretionary stocks are  in the top half of the graph, and even so, it is very close to moving into the weakening quadrant.

## Ratio Charts

These charts use a ratio to determine performance. an investor can put any two assets together to determine which is performing better relative to the other. This works by dividing one security by another. When the chart is moving up, it means the top security (as a fraction) is outperforming. 

When the chart is moving down, the bottom security is stronger. In our case, when the chart is moving up, it means the sector is performing better than the S&amp;P 500, and it is a positive for the index. When the chart moves down, the sector is lagging the S&amp;P 500, and it is detracting index performance. 

However, the most important thing about these charts is that we can use traditional technical analysis on them. 

## Cyclical Sectors

The technology and consumer discretionary sectors are the strongest performers. Technology has been leading the S&amp;P 500 since 2014, and has maintained this trend since. Mean while, the consumer discretionary sector has recently broken out of a sideways channel, which could be a sign of more longer-term out performance. 

The energy sector has been under performing since 2014, but it may have broken that trend, We will want to watch this chart to see if the out performance can continue.  

Industrial and materials stocks have been weak this year, as illustrated by their ratio charts. Materials has broken an upwards channel indicating future weaker performance. 

Industrials has remained above a support level, which is a good sign, but the ratio chart has failed to move up since the start of the year. However, since the ratio has remained above the support, we remain bullish on the sector.

## Defensive Sectors

 All three of the defensive sectors are in under performance down trends. Healthcare is trying to break that trend, so we will need to watch to see if it can find a new uptrend.   

## Conclusion

First, we looked at the Relative Rotation Graph. This told us that investors are positioning their portfolios defensively. In the short-term, investors have been buying more of the defensive sectors, which has pushed these stocks higher faster compared to the S&amp;P 500 and the other sectors. Meanwhile, the industrials, materials, and energy have been underperforming, as investors look for opportunities in the defensive sectors.

Second, we looked at the individual ratio charts. These charts show longer-term trends, and they help put the Relative Rotation Chart in perspective. These charts show the relative out performance of the defensive sectors is minor in a longer term perspective. 

While the defensive sector ratios have moved up over the last few weeks, the long-term trends show that technology, consumer discretionary, and the industrials are still in control over the long-term. 

However, it is not all clear skies. The materials sector continues to weaken, and financials are struggling. But these sectors could possibly be explained by the trade disputes in the global economy, and the fact that treasury yields have failed to move meaningfully higher.  

## What Does it Mean for the S&amp;P 500?

First, we need to point out that the S&amp;P 500 is approaching all-time highs. Defensive positioning as the market goes higher is a signal of something. Normally, we want to see the cyclical sectors take control at this point, in order to lead the index higher. Since this is not the case, it is probably a sign of future volatility.

SpicyMussolini;1534208705;973zxv;;139;;229;"# Warning: Bearish DD 

So I made some DD recently, but I don't dare post it on WSB (they will call me a permabear and a fag) so I thought what the hell, I will post it to r/stonkmarket. 

For the past nine years, the equities market has seen one of the best

percent gains since the Bull Market of 1948-1969. Corporate taxes are

low, GDP growth is strong, and joblessness well below the Natural Rate

of Unemployment (NRU).

However, quite a few ratios, economic data, and past performances

are pointing to the conclusion that this bull market is close to its

conclusion. For all data, I will be using the S&amp;P 500 Index. Sorry Dow Jones and Nasdaq. 

Nobody loves you (well I love Nasdaq fuck Dow). 

**Buffet Indicator**

Not to be confused with the Buffet Rule, the Buffet Indicator

compares the Total Market Capitalization (Market Cap) of the stock

market divided by the Total GDP.

|Ratio = Total Market Cap /  GDP|Valuation|
|:-|:-|
|Ratio &lt; 50%|Significantly Undervalued|
|50% &lt; Ratio &lt; 75%|Modestly Undervalued|
|75% &lt; Ratio &lt; 90%|Fair Valued|
|90% &lt; Ratio &lt; 115%|Modestly Overvalued|
|Ratio &gt; 115%|Significantly Overvalued|

As of 8/1/18, the Total Market Cap is 142.8% more than the total

GDP. This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of

the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at

148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%.

For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued

market by returning to a “Fairly Valued” TMC to GDP ratio. After the

tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of

75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching

former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.

**Buffet Indicator Graphs**

**Shiller P/E Ratio**

The Shiller P/E Ratio is a better measure of valuation than normal

P/E. It accounts for the fluctuations of inflation due to the business

cycle, therefore providing a more accurate picture of the true value of

the security. Thankfully, there is a plethora of data surrounding the

Shiller P/E ratio, all the way back to 1890.

MIN: 4.78 (DEC 1920)

MAX: 44.19 (Dec 1999)

RANGE: 39.41

**Price To Sales (Revenue) Ratio**

The Price to Sales Ratio (PSR), like the P/E ratio, is a way of

measuring value. Instead of comparing a company’s price to earnings, it

compares a company’s stock price to its revenues.

|Price/Revenue Per Share|PSR Valuation|
|:-|:-|
|PSR= 0-1|Undervalued|
|PSR= 1-2|Fairly Valued|
|PSR= 2-3|Overvalued|
|PSR= 3+|Significantly Overvalued|

The current for the S&amp;P500 is 2.23, and at the height of the tech

bubble, 2.44, indicating overvaluation. The chart below shows that until

the late 90s, P/S never topped 1.3.

S&amp;P 500 by Deciles 1986-Present 

[https://imgur.com/a/vgHvy3j](https://imgur.com/a/vgHvy3j) 

The graph above shows the S&amp;P grouped into deciles (each of ten

equal groups into which a population can be divided according to the

distribution of values of a particular variable (in this case Price to Sales

Ratio)). Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is

centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech.

Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&amp;P is the most

overvalued it has ever been.

**Yield Curve** 

Now we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the

world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and

interest rates. It is a crucial market sentiment indicator about the future

of the economy.

The normal yield curve shows that the shorter the maturity, the lower the yield.

[https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4](https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4)

The flat yield curve indicates a transition from an expansion to a downturn. Shorter maturities have the same yields as the 

longer maturities.

[https://imgur.com/55oabKn](https://imgur.com/55oabKn)

The Inverted Yield Curve is a strong indicator of coming recession. Shorter maturities have higher yields than longer maturities.

[https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL](https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL) 

We are currently in a flat yield curve.

**Bull Exhaustion**

Bull exhaustion, a rapid rise in stock followed by a tail off called

an exhaustion gap. Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the

bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen

in the correction in early February.

[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx) 

The failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&amp;P hasn't recovered fully yet), 

combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.

**Dow Theory (the Public)**

Dow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock

market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some

of it isn’t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a

lot of it still is relevant.

The “Market Trends” part of Dow Theory is still particular

relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory

states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.

1. Accumulation Phase

a. In the beginning of the bull market “In the know”

investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.

2. Public Participation Phase

a. The Public and amateur investors join into the market.

The uptrend becomes more obvious.

3. Distribution Phase

a. The final stage of the bull market. The “in the know”

investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant

speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend.

One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating

public. Amateur “investors” through apps like Robinhood can now

easily speculate with options and margin.

[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)

I believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very

early Distribution phase. Here is a helpful graph to visualize this

phenomenon.

Elon Musk’s announcement about his advisers might be as squishy as his funding.

[Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) hadn’t been formally tapped as a financial adviser by [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)’s chief executive officer when Musk [revealed plans](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PD3O0DAIBMDH)last week to take the automaker private and said he’d secured the funding for the transaction, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The bank still hadn’t officially signed on when Musk [said on Twitter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/musk-working-with-silver-lake-goldman-to-take-tesla-private-jkt0o4sj) late Monday that he’s working with Goldman Sachs and private-equity firm Silver Lake as financial advisers, the people said.

Such a statement from a public company CEO typically signals a formal agreement. But Musk has shown a willingness to take an unusual approach, including tweeting last week that he had funding secured for a take-private deal. That declaration has prompted regulatory scrutiny and investor lawsuits.

[Read more: Musk’s explanation unlikely to get SEC off his back](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-13/musk-s-belated-explanation-is-unlikely-to-get-sec-off-his-back)

Conversations are ongoing between Goldman Sachs and Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public.

### Informal Advice

Silver Lake appears to be in a similar situation. The technology-focused firm isn’t working for Musk in an official capacity as a financial adviser and isn’t being compensated as a consultant, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Instead, Tesla’s CEO is hoping to tap Silver Lake’s experience working on some of the biggest take-private transactions -- including Michael Dell’s $21.7 billion buyout of his namesake computer company and its subsequent $67 billion acquisition of EMC Corp. -- to help get a deal done, the person said.

Each of those transactions involved the firm making an equity commitment to help fund the deal. While Silver Lake hasn’t committed any financing to Musk’s possible buyout of Tesla, the firm hasn’t ruled out potentially making an investment at some point, the person said.

A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Representatives for Silver Lake and Tesla didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk’s latest tweet came just hours after he said Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had first approached him about helping take Tesla private early last year, and that the fund’s interest gave him the confidence to state publicly that he was thinking about the move.

“I left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving,” Musk [wrote](https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-taking-tesla-private) in a blog post Monday.

Tesla’s board is in the process of selecting financial advisers to evaluate Musk’s proposal. It has [formed a special committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/tesla-go-private-effort-advances-with-board-panel-to-study-offer), according to a statement Tuesday, which will take legal advice from Latham &amp; Watkins LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati.";141967;Goldman Sachs Had No Mandate When Musk Tweeted;

As the bizarre [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) go-private saga enters its ninth day, many investors are wondering when regulators will decide whether Elon Musk broke the rules by dripping out details so haphazardly.

History suggests it might take a while.

At the center of the Tesla controversy is what Musk meant when he tweeted Aug. 7 that he had secured funding for a buyout without providing any specifics to back up the claim. Almost a week later he said his confidence was based on conversations with a Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, which had long expressed interest in taking the electric-carmaker private.

[Click here for a QuickTake on the SEC and Musk’s Tweet](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-07/can-elon-musk-tweet-that-the-sec-may-have-an-opinion-quicktake)

Securities lawyers have [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-13/musk-s-belated-explanation-is-unlikely-to-get-sec-off-his-back) Musk’s subsequent statement showed funding was anything but secure. So it’s an open-and-shut case of misleading investors that the SEC should be able to bring pretty quickly, right?

Not necessarily.

The SEC’s average inquiry takes about two years. That kind of time frame would understandably frustrate traders who are reading Musk’s [tweets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/goldman-sachs-is-said-to-have-had-no-mandate-when-musk-tweeted) and trying to assess in real-time whether he’s actually lined up bankers and lawyers to advise on a deal. But even though Wall Street might want a quick ruling on whether he’s violated securities laws, Washington regulators may disappoint.

### Deliberative Process

The SEC is deliberative in gathering evidence to prove that executives knew their statements were false. In the Tesla matter that will probably lead to the agency trying to obtain emails, texts and phone records from Musk and the company. Attorneys representing Musk, Tesla’s founder and chief executive officer, would likely push back on some of the SEC’s requests. This back-and-forth can sometimes last weeks. From there, SEC attorneys will go through all the documents they’ve obtained to determine whom they should depose for questioning.

“I don’t think people understand the intensity of the investigation and the volume of documents and other types of evidence,” said Teresa Goody, founder and CEO of The Goody Group who previously worked as an attorney in the SEC’s general counsel office.

SEC officials may also be keen to speak with members of the Saudi wealth fund to learn if Musk’s public statements accurately reflect their private conversations. But getting foreign nationals to cooperate can be challenging, and issuing subpoenas to compel testimony doesn’t always work when the targets are overseas.

To be clear, the SEC hasn’t accused Musk or Tesla of any wrongdoing. If the SEC does determine he or the company violated the law, it will submit what’s known as a Wells notice, which notifies investigative targets that the agency’s enforcement division plans to recommend that SEC commissioners approve a lawsuit or sanction against the company.

### Defense Rebuttal

Defense attorneys typically get a chance to rebut a Wells notice, and if SEC officials think they have a point, they may opt to not bring a case. Final settlements that SEC commissioners vote on whether to approve are also heavily negotiated with defense lawyers, adding more time to the process.

Another factor that could slow things down is that the SEC’s scrutiny of Tesla goes beyond Musk’s recent tweets. The agency’s San Francisco office was already examining the company’s public pronouncements on manufacturing goals and sales targets, Bloomberg reported Aug. 9.

SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns declined to comment and a Tesla spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A sign of how long SEC probes can take is the Enron Corp. scandal, which is widely seen as one of the clearest examples of corporate wrongdoing ever. The SEC didn’t bring its first enforcement action until almost a year after Enron disclosed it was being investigated, and the case was filed about eight months on from the company’s bankruptcy filing.

### High Priority

Not everyone thinks the SEC-Musk tussle will go on for months and months. Stephen Crimmins, a former SEC enforcement lawyer, said Musk’s high-profile and the fact that his tweets have drawn so much attention will make the inquiry a priority for the regulator.

“The staff is going to want to expedite this,” said Crimmins, who’s now in private practice at Murphy &amp; McGonigle. “There’s a finite amount of information to gather, so it’s possible they could get it done in a couple of months.”

One question that could be near the top of Tesla shareholders’ minds is whether unwanted attention from the SEC might impact Musk’s ability to quickly take the company private. It certainly doesn’t help, said Joseph Grundfest, a former SEC commissioner.

""An active SEC investigation that, in my view, is likely to turn into an enforcement action is not going to make it easier to close this deal,"" said Grundfest, who’s now a professor at Stanford Law School. ""Musk is apparently thinking of an unprecedented structure that would have Tesla go private with equity-based funding, not debt. That would be hard to do without the additional risk of SEC enforcement action against Musk and Tesla.""";142219;Investors Should Brace for a Drawn-Out Tussle Between Elon Musk and the SEC;
