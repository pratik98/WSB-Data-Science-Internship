kaiserfiume;Like in Diablo, we have been collecting a lot of healing potions to cure our wounds, we collected a bunch of items, swords, shields, magic scrolls, mayo pendants and neckles, because we knew we will come to the end of the game one day, when we need to fight the Big Boss!!! We have sieges a lot of castles un Heroes of Might and Magic with much stronger army, but we won at the end. We are ready now!!! And you know what... I never used cheat codes to pass the level, to pass the game. Only real fight. Please understand, we have turned on now our Immortal Shield and we will finish this game. Power to the Players!!!! To the Moon!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀;1622591908;h095v77;t3_nq889m;2

We did have a meeting once with the technical teams and one of the executives. He was having a conversation with someone just before the meeting started and it turned to drug testing. He jokingly told the tech he was talking to ""yup, thats why you are here"". I turned to him and with an excited voice asked ""What sort of drugs are we testing?"". not something you expect someone to say to an Exec, but he laughed pretty solidly at it.

yahmandan;"Great this country is starting to finally become more sensible. While weed should be legalized there should be better education on it and proper usage. Even if you’re a medical patient there’s not much you really learn until you’ve been smoking for a couple years.

 There also needs to be a ton more coverage on CHS or Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, a deadly disease some can develop after years of smoking but others have in just months or even just single usage of 5mg edible has caused a woman to have a 6hr vomiting episode. Other more intense symptoms for people who have larger episodes are the vomiting from hours to months where it is uncontrollable and impossible to keep down anything. Then after that there’s nausea, indigestion and difficulty with certain foods, seizures, fainting, acid reflux, kidney failure from dehydration, inability to regulate temperature with sweating tons while you sleep and constantly being freezing while awake, diarrhea and stomach pain for what could be a few days to months or even over a year for those who have it extremely bad. 

There’s not much information about this to most of the public and I believe that it’s causing many more people problems but they’re not as severe so they don’t tie it together with weed. After all “weed is harmless”. I would like to see weed legalized all over and destigmatized along with more education on usage such as recommending use of a log journal to track your experience, amount used and then it would make for a better way to find strains that you really enjoy. There should also be some information in the dispensaries on walls that talks about it. They should also talk about how higher thc percentage does not equal better and ends up worse for your tolerance making smoking in the future less of an experience and more mundane. There should be a shift in the growing community to start pushing out lower thc strains under 20% rather than trying to push out artificial numbers from 35-42% like some of the growers in the medical program.";1622602253;h09pu1b;t3_nq8c5t;-3

I would argue many people who don’t understand what is going on turn to harder drugs and get addicted and end up dying from them. You can argue this point and it’s a straw man point but a perfect example of this is Cg Kid on YouTube who talks about how terrible his weed withdrawals were and how he used other drugs to cope for a while. I’ve heard 3-4 other peoples stories that are similar in that they turned to opiates to ease the pain and ended up dead.

Your brainstem has no cannabinoid receptors in it. If someone smokes enough weed to trigger CHS, and then chooses to start mainlining heroin instead of just laying off the weed, that’s a reflection on that individual’s capacity to make good choices, not on the deadliness of weed.

I worked at a fairly large hosting company and there wasn't even a sniff of the idea of testing. basically said don't come in stoned, don't smoke at work. most people followed those guidelines. those that didn't, mostly went about their day just like any other.

We did have a meeting once with the technical teams and one of the executives. He was having a conversation with someone just before the meeting started and it turned to drug testing. He jokingly told the tech he was talking to ""yup, thats why you are here"". I turned to him and with an excited voice asked ""What sort of drugs are we testing?"". not something you expect someone to say to an Exec, but he laughed pretty solidly at it. Everyone was in a good mood at that point so the meeting was a bit better than i think it would have been otherwise.";1622598295;h09i74w;t3_nq8c5t;14

yahmandan;"Great this country is starting to finally become more sensible. While weed should be legalized there should be better education on it and proper usage. Even if you’re a medical patient there’s not much you really learn until you’ve been smoking for a couple years.

 There also needs to be a ton more coverage on CHS or Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, a deadly disease some can develop after years of smoking but others have in just months or even just single usage of 5mg edible has caused a woman to have a 6hr vomiting episode. Other more intense symptoms for people who have larger episodes are the vomiting from hours to months where it is uncontrollable and impossible to keep down anything. Then after that there’s nausea, indigestion and difficulty with certain foods, seizures, fainting, acid reflux, kidney failure from dehydration, inability to regulate temperature with sweating tons while you sleep and constantly being freezing while awake, diarrhea and stomach pain for what could be a few days to months or even over a year for those who have it extremely bad. 

There’s not much information about this to most of the public and I believe that it’s causing many more people problems but they’re not as severe so they don’t tie it together with weed. After all “weed is harmless”. I would like to see weed legalized all over and destigmatized along with more education on usage such as recommending use of a log journal to track your experience, amount used and then it would make for a better way to find strains that you really enjoy. There should also be some information in the dispensaries on walls that talks about it. They should also talk about how higher thc percentage does not equal better and ends up worse for your tolerance making smoking in the future less of an experience and more mundane. There should be a shift in the growing community to start pushing out lower thc strains under 20% rather than trying to push out artificial numbers from 35-42% like some of the growers in the medical program.";1622602253;h09pu1b;t3_nq8c5t;-3

I would argue many people who don’t understand what is going on turn to harder drugs and get addicted and end up dying from them. You can argue this point and it’s a straw man point but a perfect example of this is Cg Kid on YouTube who talks about how terrible his weed withdrawals were and how he used other drugs to cope for a while. I’ve heard 3-4 other peoples stories that are similar in that they turned to opiates to ease the pain and ended up dead.

OverwatchNWeed;"Unions are fucking scum. Especially the UFCW. 

I sued an employer for wage theft that was apart of the UFCW and the only statement of support for the company in court was from the fucking union. They refused to assist me in any way. 

Unfortunately for the UFCW, the judge not only awarded me my past wages, he also allowed the damages to he doubled due to the company ""willfully"" not paying me. Unfortunately for me, there is nothing I can do to the union because of an arbitrary 6 month time limit to report things to the NLRB. 

In conclusion, I worked for a unionized cannabis company and had to sue for my wages and got no help from the union and instead found them to be an enemy.

She said just two weeks ago it went from qualified ACS advice to national medical advice in the U.S. And in fact, [that appears to be true](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/18/health/colorectal-cancer-screening-45-wellness/index.html).

OfandFor_The_People;"Cologuard is definitely easier to get people to do than a colonoscopy. It’s also been available to patients and providers for 7+ years. Barriers to use include cost/lack of coverage by some insurance companies (less of a barrier now as some cover it) and provider/patient knowledge of it as a preferential option to simple iFOBT (the most common but less accurate put-your-poopsmear-on-a-piece-of-cardboard test which only detects blood—which, if you have colon cancer, is likely to show up, but not always, and if you have hemorrhoids or a stomach ulcer will cause a positive test too).

aka0007;"Weiss has 179M in AUM. 82,622 shares of AMC short is $3M or 1.67% of their AUM.

I would guess that you would probably need the stock price to go up at least 5X its current price to make them get hot under the collar.. but that would put AMC's market cap at $70B.. GME by comparison reached a $24B market cap on 1/27/2021.

So enjoy your dream of a squeeze that will never happen.

Oh, if it came close to that, remember what happened when GME threatened the solvency of the markets... Tomorrow if the price remains high and continues to go up, Apes will buy too many options, which will mean that a gamma squeeze will pose the same issues that they posed with GME.. On Thursday, trading will be restricted and the price will collapse.

Agreed that brokers will respond to significant collateral requirements in the way that they have to.

You can start you own business in that industry a lot easier than opening a business with the skills from a business degree.

Now there is an extreme shortage in blue-collar labor down in US, not sure about Canada. Because millennials and zoomer‘s were told that’s disgusting and you should never do that. Most of those jobs actually end up paying comparable, if not more than some of the lower in college degrees do.

fifthjack_TTV;"We don’t but it would be stupid for states NOT to legalize it. If the state next to you is raking in millions in extra every year with marijuana sales, it would be a disadvantage for YOUR state NOT to legalize it. From a financial POV, it makes sense for every state to legalize it. That being said, this is a very slow process because it involves lazy politicians. But in a long term (5-10 years), this is a great investment. I have been holding APHA for a very long time (since 2017). But the reason why you are investing rn shouldn’t be soley due to shorting (even though this idea gets me wet) 

1. The merger of tilray and aphria was basically the most perfect thing that happened for both companies. Aphria has one of the lowest production cost associated with their products. They are involved in THC beverages, medications, edibles, medical patches, and many more. BUT their only problem was that they were not selling enough because they did not have the best connections (barely any sales in the states; most were in Canada). They literally had the space and the means to produce BUT not enough sales to push it all through. On the other hand, Tilray is completely the opposite. They have amazin connections and they dipped their toes in the US market a long time ago so they are very diverse in the US market. But they had HORRIBLE production cost (one of the highest) so it was hard for them to sell a lot even though they HAD many consumer interests. Overall, this recent merger is going to positively reflect the company.
2. Led my a solid team. Before APHA was led by some questionable leaders but now their leadership is amazing.
3. They are the biggest marijuana company IN THE WORLD. They will dominate in coming years
4. They are in Germany and many parts in europe —&gt; huge market
5. One of the lowest production cost

These are some pros but there are definitely more good things happening. IMO, in 5-10 years, this company is gonna be well off and dominate this sector. That being said, if this stock gets shorted, i will probably sell most of positions around $35-40 CAD and buy more when it drops back to $20 CAD range.";1622599244;h09k1u4;t3_nqa2me;25

""The product is too good..."" I respectfully disagree.

$APHA had it figured out when former CEO Vic Neufels said weed would be commoditized. He made a smart move going for lowest all-in -cost production from the beginning. Unfortunately he's gone because of some perceived bad faith due to a short attack and we both know they are now called $TLRY.

I agree with you $ACB overpaid for some assets and also built a sh--tonne of planned capacity when the market simply wasn't there.

I don't really hate on $ACB I just think there are better choices out there and they have yet to prove (to me at least) that they will run the company any better having already done another share offering after the consolidation.

I own all of these names and more, my $ACB shares are free as a result of one of the companies they bought along the way (maybe Medreleaf?) So I kinda don't care where they go.";1622684549;h0dz7v1;t3_nqa2me;1

jbake27_;Honestly it depends on your specific risk tolerance just in general for any volatile meme stock I’d say between 25-35%, which imo is a good balance between letting the stock move freely without stopping you out and being too loose to where you aren’t securing a great amount of profits at the top wherever the top may be. Again all depends on your personal risk tolerance this is just how I do it others experience may vary.;1622616511;h0acaes;t3_nqa5x8;4

ethanplee;RKT gama squeezed but it didn't have a short squeeze therefore it fell right after. Along with that, RKT doesn't have the same salience as AMC does. GME/AMC they squeezed and dropped afterwards. For GME it was because robinhood locked up trading which killed the other meme stocks. But look at GME/AMC now, even though they were already thrown down they're climbing back up which shows that it's fairly resiliant;1622618086;h0ae4n8;t3_nqa5x8;3

From what I gather, the open interest means these calls haven't been actioned yet and therefore the rise in aftermarket yesterday means they likely started to get delta hedged?

3. market was fairly bearish due to inflation fears which influences all stocks across the board generally

But recently GME option volume has seen a sharp increase along with AMC, hence it rallying up to 250$/share. While GME is great and i'm still a tard bag holding it because i believe this phenomenon will continue, a bit comparison would be Tesla. Tesla over the course of a year just kept shooting up and up and up, most likely because of multiple Gamma and short squeezes. And now a ""fair value price"" is 400$ pre split, but it's sitting comfy at a 500-700$ value post 1-4 split.";1622637862;h0b2nqi;t3_nqa5x8;2

masuraj;"That's why it doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere.  There a 'big fish' group im in that are all talking about the feds doing a share count on AMC to see if the dtcc is doing their job or if they are pulling the same shit they pulled with GME.  By the sounds of it, they expect there to be an announcement or PR in the coming \~24 hours.  If it comes out that this bitch is shorted anywhere near 75% this thing is going to go into a feeding frenzy.  Like I said, place your bets tomorrow am.  All of these people are predicting the count is fukt and insiders know this is coming and obviously the volume velocity right now is only helping the situation.

I really have no proof or link so you will just have to take some strangers word for it but I first got this info on May 13th....right when this all started and they've been right all along and they are saying the way this is going $100 is not crazy.

&gt; The e-commerce company&amp;#039;s public policy team will be actively supporting The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021, which seeks to legalize marijuana at the federal level, its consumer boss Dave Clark said in a blog post.

&gt; &amp;quot;In the past, like many employers, we&amp;#039;ve disqualified people from working at Amazon if they tested positive for marijuana use,&amp;quot; Clark said.

&gt; Amazon was hit with a proposed class action suit, which claimed that the company was violating a New York City law by testing applicants for jobs at local facilities for marijuana, according to a Westlaw report.

drifty-t-sleep;"In 2020 AWS was responsible for 63% of their operating profits. Considered one of the most profitable tech companies in the world. 

The thing you need to consider is that Amazon as itself does not make much profit. How do you think they do 2-day shipping on everything. They lose money/break even/make very little on almost every transaction made. They are basically just trying to aggressively cut out competition by offering prices and shipping times so absurd nobody can compete. They do this by losing tons and tons of money, money they can afford to lose because AWS comes in to save the day. Why do we hear so much about tech these days, partly because it is incredible profitable by nature.  

They treat the other employees like shit, well because they don't matter to Amazon. They aren't making Amazon money, they are the main reason they are losing money.

baseball9734;"Bb has so freaking much potential. I know here it's considered a ""meme"" stock, but in all reality it isn't. I love the AMC play just for short term easy gains, but bb is a very good long term hold (1 to 3 years). I highly suggest going to the bb sub and doing some research. There's alot of great dd there and you my find some really interesting and promising stuff. To also clarify I hold positions in both bb and AMC and am not a financial advisor.";1622604805;h09unhk;t3_nqc8jr;2

asset6;I have been in deep thought about what to do after the AMC squeeze. I think AMC will launch first, then the rest will follow. It would be unbelievable if AMC peaked and on the way down we could sell then buy GME or BB which hopefully starting their squeeze.;1622604919;h09uuxp;t3_nqc8jr;3
99rating;BB is a million times better in every way possible. AMC executives have been selling their shares and leaving retail investors to bag hold while BB execs are doing the opposite, they are all in on BB working hard to be the future of cyber security! Idk about you but I'd rather invest in a team who is fully committed and invested in themselves and the company!;1622604965;h09uy2t;t3_nqc8jr;2
Flipping_stock22;AMC is all there is. Jump in BB after AMC squeezes. This isn’t even a debate. There is no question.;1622605036;h09v31n;t3_nqc8jr;2

USA_RedWhiteBlue1776;Seems the common sense approach is $BB but for short term gains would a call $11 call on $BB make more sense then one on AMC given the increased price  from the volatility?;1622605163;h09vc38;t3_nqc8jr;2
USA_RedWhiteBlue1776;The AMC calls are so expensive. Would it make more sense to push a $10 $BB call in the meantime?;1622605232;h09vgwv;t3_nqc8jr;1

Are you putting money in tomorrow at open or when your truck sells? 

Not to be a Debby downer but you might end up losing what you put in. Can you afford to lose it? 

If you lose it, you’ll affirm your families suspicions of you being a loser. Your not just putting your money on the line but your ego too!
