donkeyjaw1;Landlord here. In my opinion student rentals are a sub speciality of the business. Yes the nominal rents may be high, but you have high vacancies and applicants who lack rental history. When making investment decisions we discount the rents by 20% for vacancies and maintenance. Student rentals could be even worse. It takes expertise to deal with all that. You may find as well that the school has an outsized policy impact on local land use issues which can greatly distort the market.  Think hard about this. ;1514778019;ds0whex;t3_7ncsd4;5

TOMtheCONSIGLIERE;"&gt; Pros and cons of renting to college students?

They should be obvious.

-

Pros:

- Potentially a lot of housing needed around a fixed market (^ demand from college/grad students), and
- High demand could mean higher rents (than an area without a college)

-

Cons:

- High turnover,
- College/Grad Students may not have credit and/or income (may need guarantors or extra security),
- Riskier pool (not just credit-wise) because younger adults may not be responsible with your property, and
- [Potentially] Higher maintenance costs if Ts don't properly maintain your property

-

&gt; Good idea or bad idea?

I don't care if a potential T is a student or not. Do some due diligence, verify the T and take the best T. ";1514898273;ds2swaj;t3_7ncsd4;1

So - $1000 for a new position, since I'll have to pay commission on open *and* close, and $500 to add to an existing position since I can close with the original position I already accounted for.

This is just a rule that I made up at some point, but seems reasonable to me to limit commission losses to 1% or less.  I've started buying mostly commission-free ETFs anyway as I generally only have $3-500 to invest at a time, so I've actually paid considerably less than that.";1514821629;ds1eg0i;t3_7nd4aa;3

If the sale commission is strongly expected to be a different dollar amount, that would effect my purchase minimum (specific case had zero purchase commission and $25 sale commission).  
  
Lower commission is better, so that 0.5% is a limit, not a target.  From there it is a tradeoff of the inconvenience of waiting longer and/or diversifying less vs. commission %";1514824244;ds1g6bm;t3_7nd4aa;2
foxygrandpa092;"Depends on how much you think the purchase will appreciate. 1000 dollar investment requires one percent appreciation. 100 dollar investment requires ten percent appreciation, and so on.

Investoid;Commissions make it an extra layer of consideration because it slows down small investments and makes people aim even bigger, like investing two to three times per year, which increases the potential reward but also the short term risk. I would also weigh a minimum of 1k and probably would wait until 5k to bring down the cost even further if your brokerage charges. Any higher and you enter the market for some scary price swings and any lower the commissions would eat into your earnings.;1514828433;ds1jbrs;t3_7nd4aa;2
Long_Oil;"It depends on the total number of positions that you have open. While it is always better to pay close to small % to open/close a trade, this isn't always possible. If you have a small number of holdings, in the event that ""you see a collapse coming"" it is possible to liquidate all your holdings with less than 100$. If say you have 4 etf's, maybe it wouldn't hurt to buy a few individual stocks and let them all DRIP. 

If you are looking for a &lt; 3 week hold, anything less than 2000$ is probably not worth it if you have to pay commissions. This is because your necessary price change to make a profit is huge relative to the risk you take. ";1514830512;ds1kzpe;t3_7nd4aa;1

FearNotMan;Only worrying about the percentage of the total net cost doesn't take into consideration the opportunity cost of not making the trade.  Holding excess cash until you reach a trade threshold may mean missing out on gains.  Also consider the holding period of the investment after the trade is made.

Amarsir;"It also matters how long you intend to hold, the expected return, and how long you'd be sitting out waiting for a bigger sum.

When I trade options it's $6.95 + $0.75 / contract. And it's rare that I put more than $2000 on a single position because each is highly volatile and my capital pool isn't that huge. So this is just the cost of doing business.

I've read up at noroboinvestor.com and like the idea of a little more control but don't think I can justify the small decrease in expenses.  Depending how you weight the portfolio, for example - VTSAX (0.04) + VTIAX (0.11) + VBTLX (0.05) -- a weighed average of those will save around $400 - 500 per $10,000 over 20 years assuming a 6% return (and yes I realize that this last year was not a 6% return but I'm not anticipating it can continue anywhere near this rate).
I love the set-it-and-forget-it aspect of VFIFX.  No rebalancing or transaction fees - just a set deposit every month that will adjust my stock/bond ratio accordingly as I age.  That's worth a few thousand dollars of my time over a few decades.

Dragonlordsk8er;"Okay So I've spend today trying to understand bond etfs and I'm more confused than when I actually started.

My issue is (I'm reading bond etfs topics on this subreddit) That people are saying that if interest rates increase for bond etfs the price of the bond etf lowers. How does that even make sense?  Shouldn't the price of a bond increase if it's now giving you a higher interest rate?

So far this is going to be my investment strategy 
37.5% - iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251882/ishares-msci-world-ucits-etf-acc-fund

37.5% - ISHARES MSCI WORLD EUR HEDGED ETF (IBCH) https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251891/ishares-msci-world-eur-hedged-ucits-etf

25% - Un-decided etf bond 

I am from europe (malta) with the intention of staying in malta. I will be placing money every 3 months to rebalance the percentages. I am 25 years old, Will be adding 1% in the bond etf every year in correlation with my age while reducing .5% from the other 2 etf's.

 The reason why I decided to hedge half and expose half to forex risk of the MSCI World UCITS ETF is to

-Diversify.

-Take advantage of buying cheaper since if the dollar where to lower I'd be buying more shares for the unhedged fund and vice versa.

The reason why I want to add a bond etf is to 

-Diversify 

-In case of a stock market crash I'd have something to back it up I think at least

Anyways what would you guys recommend me getting (bond etf) for this style of portfolio my preference is something global (international) like the MSCI World etf if you know what I mean. 

Something that could grow if the stock market stays stable and if the stock market crashes it could be like a defence mechanism sort of.

Would very long term bond etfs be the way to go or very short term bond etfs?

P.S I have never invested and quite dumb on the subject is my strategy diversified enough or no?  

Thanks for all that reply

kiwimancy;"When the yield of comparable bonds increases, current bonds are less attractive. Their price falls so that the yield to maturity going forward matches the yield of the other bonds. Likewise, if the yield falls, it means price rose. Yield and price are mathematical inverses. Just like the future return on a stock and its price, assuming its fundamentals are held constant.  

That said, the relationship between interest rates and bond yields is not so simple. Bonds may have some interest rate hikes priced into their yields. If you know hikes are coming from the central bank, then the bond market definitely knows.";1514824718;ds1gidw;t3_7neuat;3

Dragonlordsk8er;"Owwwwwwwwww I think I finally understood it how you explained it. Let me clarify what I think I understood. Basically interest rates stay the same once you bought the etf bond. What changes is the price of a new etf bond being created with different interest rates. Resulting in people not wanting to buy that bond etf for the obvious reason that the new bond etf is giving a better interest resulting in a better yield resulting in the 'old etf' lowering in price so that it gives the same yield as the new one.

Can't believe took me so much time to understand this haha.

 Basically if I where to be buying monthly this bond etf I'd be safe sort of speaking. As I don't think the interest of a new etf bond is going to be priced significantly higher or they would crash the market. Thanks again kiwimancy :D";1514826210;ds1hmul;t3_7neuat;2

- $5,500 contribution made in February 2014 for tax year 2014. No other contributions or conversions have been added to the account since 2014.

That's a total of $21,000 for conversions + contributions, not including gains or losses. If I were to withdraw $20,000 this month (in tax year 2018) would this distribution be 100% tax and penalty free without using any of the exemption rules for an early (&lt; 59.5 yo) withdrawal?

Pezzonovanta;Hello there, I am a 19 YO student in Italy and I want to work part time on the weekends so I can use that money to invest. My schooling and living expenses are taken care of so I don´t need to work and willing to take risk, I just want to see how to grow money. What would you guys recommend? It´s is not going to be a lot of money, I am assuming it is going to be around 200 euros a month.;1514846077;ds1y09e;t3_7neuat;2
nebulousmenace;"Chiming in on 401-K's /IRA's.  ""normal"" investment is after tax: you pay tax on the money, you invest it, and you pay tax on the investment income as you go. With 401-K's and traditional IRA's you don't have to pay tax on what you put into the account. You DO have to pay tax when it comes out of the account but capital and earnings are tax-free. 

EASY-NUMBER TAX EXAMPLE: You're making 8% a year every year, you're paying 25% income tax, and you're retiring in 36 years. So if you're paying taxes you are actually making 6% (2 percentage points is 25% of 8 percentage points). 8% doubles [about every 9 years](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ruleof72.asp), 6% doubles about every 12 years. In 36 years your initial money doubles either 4 times (8%) or 3 times (6%) . $5000 now becomes either $80,000 or $40,000 at retirement. 

A Roth IRA is where you invest post-tax dollars but you don't have to pay tax when you withdraw it. 

**401-K NOTE:** Most jobs ""match"" a certain percentage of your 401-K, so they might match 50% of your first 6%. If you put 6% into your 401-K they will give you 3% to match it. This is the only ""can't lose"" deal in investing I know of. At the very least put enough in your 401-K to get the full matching deal. ";1514846884;ds1ynh7;t3_7neuat;2

nnavvann;"I'm a senior in high school right now, and I have ~$1000 to invest (set aside from a smaller amount of recreational money). I will also be getting around another ~$2000 by the time I leave for college. I've been debating on what I should do with this money; should I wait until I see a big market crash, etc. Could I have some advice?

How old are you? 18

Are you employed/making income? How much? I am not employed, but I will be getting around ~$200 per month from family.

What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?) Compound investing; long term saving.

What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) Doesn't need to be 100% safe, but I'd like to know that even if the market fluctuates, in the long run I will be gaining money.

What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?) Nothing.

Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset) My parents will be paying for my undergraduate funds. In essence, I will not have any debt soon, but I also don't own anything, really.

What is your time horizon? Literally like 40 years.

Any big debts? None

Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. I will probably have a small cash flow during college, whether from jobs or from parents, which I can use to keep investing; the next 4 years is as far into the future as I can look.

I keep on hearing that the market is about to burst, which worries me into investing my money right now. Should I be worried? What first steps should I take?

&gt;  Should I be worried? What first steps should I take?

well, congratz on starting early! compounding will work magic for you as a long term investor.... 

so, i believe its very difficult to predict the future, and a way to not have to worry about trying to predict the future and tops and bottoms in the market is to take the money that you are planing on investing and separate it into equal amounts that you then invest at  a consistent rate, for instance divide your initial $1000 by 12 and invest once a month till your principal amount is used, continue investing as you can
if you receive lump sums then divide them equally and continue with your long term investment plan and as you learn more begin to tailor your investing decisions to your life

do you want to worry is the question you can ask yourself, risk (or worry) can be controlled to some degree, in many ways, how much worry you want is up to you, for instance by dividing your money into equal amounts and investing at a set time period you will sometimes buy low, sometimes buy high and it will even out in the long term... its not perfect but its a good start

the first steps you need to take are determining goals, risks, and then talking to a (preferably free) financial adviser to open an account and enter the market";1514849853;ds210hz;t3_7neuat;3

foxygrandpa092;"Vanguard is fine. Fidelity and Schwab are fine too for that purpose. The nice thing about index investing is that it's simple, so you can get it done lots of places with equivalent results.

I'd normally advocate for attacking the 401k more than a taxable account, but if you need the liquidity for the house down payment, that's fine. However, be aware if there's a market downturn, that could complicate things. Consider saving some proportion of your money in a very liquid form (savings account), and investing the other part in the taxable account. Inflation hurts to the tune of 3 percent every year. A bad market downturn can be 30 percent, and over the short term the market can be unpredictable.";1514858835;ds2872x;t3_7neuat;2

I definitely want to protect the majority of the house fund, but I'm trying to figure out what the best options are for minimizing risk and pretty much guaranteeing a return that at least matches inflation. Government bonds maybe? I know I have at least a year before buying a house. Right now, I have a little more than $7k in savings, sitting in a 1.25% savings account, and of course the interest I earn is taxed at the federal and state level, so it's really a lot less than 1.25%.";1514859852;ds293d5;t3_7neuat;2

Joehac02;While I did not hop on the cryptocurrency bandwagon I have a basic understanding of how it works. The main thing I would tell you is that if you want to use crypto use it as a currency to actually buy things like on Overstock.com (which accepts Bitcoin!!). I think in the long run Bitcoin will return to its pre-rise levels as it begins being accepted as a legitimate currency. However, I would be wary as many governments seem wary of its decentralization and may crack down on it in the future. That's just my take on it. But if you are looking into using it as an investment vehicle I would use Alt-Coins like Eytherium, Ripple or LiteCoin. Those seem primed for jumps. ;1514861763;ds2aq1a;t3_7neuat;2

If WFC chooses to redeem them at the next ex-div date, you will get less than you paid for it (plus possibly the latest dividend amount, not sure on the details).

In case you are under the impression that dividends are the best form of returns, they are not. When a stock pays a dividend it comes directly out of its value. The share price drops by the dividend amount because the company can no longer use that cash to fund future growth. Share buybacks are also a more tax efficient way to return capital to shareholders. If you're using dividends in some kind of strategy, it might be helpful to use shareholder yield (dividends plus buybacks) instead of just dividend yield.

As for stops, some people like them some don't. When you set a stop loss market order and the price hits your stop but keeps falling sharply, your price may be a bit lower than the stop you set. If you set a stop loss limit without a conservative limit price, you have the risk of it not executing. In either case, you may end up selling when the price swings down and then miss it if it bounces back up. However momentum is a thing and stops can be useful for that.

you dont have to sign anything right away, just go for knowledge if you want and then make a decision after thinking about your choices

As you can see, a few of these aren't funded at all, that's why the pie looks a little weird. I finalized this portfolio over the weekend. So the allocation will start being balanced with my next deposits. I'm probably going to throw about another 6k in it this week.

Also, most stocks are in the red right now because the 2k was placed in half way through dec when hedge funds dump stocks for tax purposes before end of year, I should expect to see some of those come back into the green over the next couple months. 

For the actual/target column. The top number is how much money is actually there, and the bottom is what I want the allocation to bring. This platform won't sell stocks to balance, it just adds new money into the underweight securities. So the 6k i'll put in will be distributed to these and make the pie balanced.

Right now though, I feel that the companies I have selected all have pretty good stories. The ones I consider the safest bets and i'm extremely confident in I have the highest weight. And the ones I consider more volatile but I feel have significant upside potential I have put at lower weight. And then I have 20% in investor grade corporate bonds to temper the ups/downs a little.

explosivecompression;"Robo-advisors work by following the efficient frontier to generate a specific portfolio for each defined risk level.  They mix asset classes in different ratios to maximize the expected returns and stay within volatility constraints.  In the end, they're just buying cheap index funds in varying percentages to represent each asset class.

You can easily do this yourself and avoid the extra fees.  Put it all in now, not later, into a portfolio that's properly diversified across a broad range of asset classes and tailored to your time horizon.  Even if you dropped it all in SPX, over the long term you're still going to come out ahead.  Throw bonds, international/EM, real estate, commodities, etc. into the mix and you'll likely achieve similar returns with significantly less volatility.

You are unlikely to itemize more than 24K, especially with SALT being capped at 10K. Of all the options you listed, this is the only one with guaranteed return, at a rate better than a bond / CD.

6) My understanding is that 529 plan contributions are tax-deductible like 401k AND withdrawals are tax-free as long as they are used for qualified education expenses. Investment property is not tax-free.

I'm not going to tell you what to do, but it seems that if you are concerned about market correction, it would be a good idea to deleverage. Perhaps when you feel good about the market again you can re-mortgage your property and invest in an index fund then.

I'm actually wondering about the same thing. Corporate tax cut has suddenly increased every corp's after-tax profit. Repatriating oversees profits also became more advantages. So we should see the bull market continue, at least in the near term. I have no idea when it will all come crashing down or what the trigger will be.

$0.10 to $0.99 CAD	500 shares

To place an order to buy a Canadian security offered at $0.75 per share, your order quantity would need to be a multiple of 500 (the board lot size); e.g., 500 shares, 1,000 shares, 1,500 shares, and so on.

factory81;"Energy will do better in 2018. OPEC countries have reduced output through the end of 2018. Price in oil will be driven by tension in oil producing regions combined with accidents or attacks disrupting supply. E.G. - large cracks in pipelines in the north sea reduced output on the line while it was inspected/repaired. Also to boot, a GOP president is in office. Oil and oil firm stocks seem to rise when the GOP comes to power (I am saying this is intentional due to their inherit love affair with this industry).

The only thing that will offset the increase in demand and OPEC output being down will be non-OPEC countries, specifically countries like USA and how fast they start rigs back up as they become profitable. 

I continue to be underweight energy. I am pessimistic on hydrocarbons. The industry is ""constantly under attack"". China banning inefficient cars. China moving toward electric vehicles. EV auto prices are reaching attainable prices, while charging infrastructure continues to expand. More euro-cities moving to ban car use in the cities (Amsterdam wants to eliminate cars accessing Schiphol airport even. All of this is while individuals are increasingly living in urban areas, and increasingly looking for ways to ditch the car; in favor of ride sharing, or public transit.

Home prices largely make the holy grail of living and working in the same neighborhood challenging, and this is keeping people in their autos driving from the burbs to the city centers. This is why commute times as a whole seem to be increasing, as a result - cities are working to try and find ways to offer affordable housing for middle income americans.

bullpup1337;"As an investor, you have to come to terms with the fact that you won't be able to pick winners and losers reliably. No one, not even the best investors in the world can do that.

If you're very good, you might be able to be slightly better than average, but some people doubt even that. So you have to accept that there will be a lot of stocks that rise that you did not invest in, and that some of your investments turn out to be bad. But that's normal. The way to deal with that is to not put all your eggs in one basket and to distribute your money over multiple investments, to reduce your overall risk. You also have to become emotionally detached from the stocks you invest (or don't invest) in.

So, a good investor won't fret over missed opportunities, since he knows that hindsight bias is a thing. He might reevaluate his initial reasons to invest or not invest into a particular stock (or other asset), but just because an investment turned out to be profitable, doesn't mean it was a sound decision.

With that being said, I think the correct answer is to recognize that crypto-currency was always a risky gamble and not a sound investment, so not having put a lot of money into it was probably the right decision. But that's just my opinion.";1514837856;ds1r7ft;t3_7nh86h;-1

midtownmidge;"Actually, maybe the OP can answer something I’ve been wondering about regarding crypto. What real wealth has crypto produced? I mean if I buy Apple stocks, I know Apple owns buildings and other tangible assets. They produce tangible products. They need to employ people to produce those products and in the process create wealth for those people. People who buy Apple products are also (in theory) better off than without those products. 

Same goes for most companies I can think of. There are people who are producing something material that other people pay for.

With crypto, besides people rushing in to buy coins off of other people, what exactly is being produced here? For every $1M you make, you just took $1M from other people who are now nominally holding title to your coins. And they’re waiting for other suckers, I mean “investors”, to maybe pay them $2M for their $1M.

InvestingLifeSavings;iPhone x starting price is $999 while Samsung S9 coming out next year is rumored to start at $725. Samsung also sells cheaper older models too. I'm not saying I love Samsung either though, I'm thinking some unknown manufacturer could disrupt the industry eventually with a cheap phone. ;1514839014;ds1s6wf;t3_7nhc2r;-10
tRacer4201;"I have a Galaxy S7. It's considerably slower than a year ago. I don't think Apple is the only one slowing down phones.

I said in a post yesterday. Apple has a devoted following. It's not only about the sexy appeal of the product. As cheesy as it sounds, people are intoxicated by the brand. Americans are willing to go into debt with monthly payment plans to purchase these devices every couple years. Unless I see other economic indicators, I think people will continue to do so.

&gt; I'm thinking like how an amazon fire 7 for $50 is expected to compete with the Apple iPad for $300+.

The $50 consumer segment is completely different than the $300 segment. If you compare a Fire to the latest iPad side by side, one is a laggy device that's mostly okay for quickly checking e-mail or reading Kindle books.

&gt;Selling at over $1000 is a deal breaker for me and I would strongly consider taking my business to Samsung if it was time for a new phone.

I have a Samsung right now and wouldn't purchase another one because it became slow after updates, not to mention all the garbage bloatware I can't uninstall.

I wouldn't pay $1,000 for a new phone, but I'll probably wait for the next cheaper phone from Apple when I'm ready to toss my S7 in about 2.5 years.

&gt;I worry that the next time there's an economic downturn, no one is going to be able to afford these luxury products and Apple will have to drastically lower its profit margins in order to stay competitive.

Can't argue with this one. Apple's fans are buying their new devices with each release and going into debt to service these transactions. Even with companies like T-Mobile offering leases and upgrades on phones, this isn't truly sustainable when Americans realize they're overleveraged. But I think if anyone can answer when that will happen, they could become rich and retire right now.";1514839103;ds1s9io;t3_7nhc2r;7
InvestingLifeSavings;"Thanks for the first hand info! Yeah new iPhones are expensive but it doesn't seem like the alternatives are much better. Older iPhones seem like a good alternative yeah. 

With the kindle fire analogy, I was thinking people may one day realize they don't need their cellphones to be these amazing $1000 magical pocket rectangles, and instead could settle for something that maybe doesn't run games as well, but is cheap and does a good job calling, texting, and running mapping applications.

jkiley;"I don't agree with your product and pricing reasoning for a few reasons, but I agree with your stock price and cash observations. 

1. We've seen in the past that Apple customers will continue to pay up, presumably by changing other spending patterns. Look at the backlash Toyota is getting for not supporting CarPlay. It's an example of the hierarchy that consumers have when it comes to products.
1. The $1000 price point isn't a big deal. As others have pointed out, most phones are on payment plans, and we've seen (in autos) how that obscures prices. Also, buying cycles are lengthening out, so total spend over time may not be that different.
1. There's a market for high end devices, and the breaking of the old two-year carrier cycle has opened up pricing and exploration on that front. There are new products at the previous levels, so this is simply an additional layer above. 
1. Apple's success is from better products, not marketing. If you want a product that works well and reflects great designers making decisions on your behalf, no one else is close. They don't often deliver a feature (in name) first, but they have repeatedly figured out the earliest point that a technology can be made into a successful product on a large scale.
1. If you're holding for the long-term, the price is less of an issue, but you're right about pessimism cycles on the price. Their buybacks benefit from that, but it's not always fun to watch.
1. I agree that the cash is interesting. We may see some capital return, but the biggest opportunity would be a recession. The business would weather it better than others, and they'd be choosing between buybacks at a discount and M&amp;A opportunities as stretched valuations come back to earth. I'm not sure I see them buying Netflix or anything like that, but there will be opportunities out there.

Costco and Home Depot are “buy companies you love” stocks. I think both will live and prosper through amazons onslaught. Costco offers an experience that you do not get online. And bored wealthy housewives don’t want to sit home and shop on amazon. I would give up my amazon prime before my Costco membership. Home Depot averages $70 sales a customer cart and $2,500 a contractors cart. And again. I think Home Depot won’t lose market share to amazon. If you are repainting your bathroom  you go to Home Depot. Not amazon. 

Estée Lauder is a company my wife thinks I should buy. She says they pretty much control makeup. I’m kind of buying it so we can have a mini competition of which one of our picks do better.

I don’t exactly love PayPal themselves. But they are smart investors and are wrapping their tentacles around lots of things. Them owning Venmo I think is pretty cool. There are multiple ways they could monetize it if they needed the cash. 

Salesforce is expensive but I work in tech and have yet to see a convincing threat to them. They are massive and it’s difficult for companies to switch from them after signing up because so much of the business processes get wrapped up in them it becomes expensive and time consuming to switch to something else. It’s similar to Apple where people specialize in salesforce and it’s hard for companies to switch over when you have people that know salesforce, wrote salesforce apps, and other cloud companies have tiny communities. 


I also own a little Disney and Shopify. I think Disney has a huge shot with their new steaming service to take a bite out of Netflix. And they are actually decently priced compare to other big companies. Below market average actually. But this is a risk. Disney is aggressive and I think of they can pull all their content off of everywhere and offer a steaming service that offers espn, Fox, Pixar, Disney classics, Disney jr,m and Disney channel, Star Wars, etc. they could take a huge bite out of Netflix for families that want a more kid friendly steaming service. 

And I think Shopify is just the best small company ecommerce platform right now. Shopify is super volatile so I only have 3% allocation to them. But they aren’t a scam like that guy said they are that tanked their stock. I helped a 50 employee company move onto their platform. It’s really good.

mdatwood;"&gt; The iPhone X is too expensive and there has been bad publicity surrounding iPhone batteries lately which could eat into their sales numbers.

Not at all. The average consumer only hears ""$29 for a new battery"", which in their mind is a huge advantage. If anyone digs a little deeper they'll realize all phones have this issue as they age. My Android and iOS devices both used to shut down with 30% battery left when they were older and put into either hot or cold climate.

&gt;Additionally, there may be new, cheap smartphones which may not be as powerful as an iPhone, but gets the job done. I'm thinking like how an amazon fire 7 for $50 is expected to compete with the Apple iPad for $300+.

Keep in mind that Apple now has a full line up of phones starting at $349. They already have a cheap, not as powerful way to stay in the iOS ecosystem. Also note, the Fire tablets are garbage. Pay to get rid of ads, horrible battery life, slow, etc...

Finally, the biggest thing people forget about when talking about users leaving Apple is the physical stores. If I have an iPhone issue I can walk into a store and walk out in a few minutes with a new iPhone. Where does a user even go to deal with a Samsung phone issue? I've been told Google is slowly improving their CS with the Pixel, but users still have to deal with cross shipping. For a lot of people their phone is their *only* connected device. Being able to walk into a store and fix/trade it for a new one in minutes is a huge deal and one not easily replicated by any of the competitors.

The iPhone X is too expensive and there has been bad publicity surrounding iPhone batteries lately which could eat into their sales numbers. Selling at over $1000 is a deal breaker for me and I would strongly consider taking my business to Samsung if it was time for a new phone. I can only imagine other consumers must feel the same way.

Well, you're kind of ignoring the 8, 8+, and earlier models that are still being sold. If you want to buy a new iPhone you don't *have to* spend $1,000. There are a lot of people out there who are perfectly happy with their 7s and 8s.

&gt; Additionally, there may be new, cheap smartphones which may not be as powerful as an iPhone, but gets the job done. I'm thinking like how an amazon fire 7 for $50 is expected to compete with the Apple iPad for $300+.

This was actually the main thrust of the 2012-2013 AAPL bear thesis, that the increased quality and cheaper relative price of Android phones would kill AAPL's cash cow. It turned out not to be true then, and I'm not sure why it would be true now; Apple is one of those companies where system integration and build quality make people more likely to pay a bit of a premium. (Which mostly goes away anyway when you look at resale values.)

I think of AAPL as a bit like Honda. Hondas aren't the cheapest car for the money spec-wise but few people have been burned by the company, so it engenders brand loyalty versus something like Hyundai. 

(Though things like the ""throttling"" controversy do brand damage, that's for sure, and it's worth paying attention to see how much this harms the company.)

&gt; Lastly and least importantly, looking at the max history of the AAPL stock price charts shows that the company tends to fall out of favor for long periods of time every few years.

I really have no answer to this as I'm not a technical trader. I do agree that Wall Street tends to *hate* this company, as shown by P/E ratios that have lagged the broader market and other tech names for half a decade now.

MuzzyIsMe;"This argument you are making would make sense 5+ years ago, but not now. 

Over and over again there are “better” alternatives to the iPhone but Apple keeps beating them all and selling more and more. 
People like Apple hardware and software, and their brand isn’t diminishing. In the grand scheme, nobody cares about stuff like the battery issues lately, either. 

You have to understand the power of branding. Go look at cars for a perfect example. You can probably buy a Hyundai with similar paper specs to a Mercedes for 1/3 the price, but almost everyone would take the Mercedes if they could afford it, the brand is simply so prestigious. 
When it comes to phones, it is a luxury item that even modest incomes can afford (let’s not get into the debate on what people should spend money on). 

Also, your bit about worrying about the next economic downturn - we went through this in 2008 and luxury goods weren’t badly hurt. 
Rich people still have money during economic downturns and people with less money have shown they will cut out discretionary spending like eating out rather than sacrifice their luxuries. 

Apple is also much more than the iPhone. Their Watch business is worth billions on its own. Not to mention Mac, iPad, and services. They have a massive retail network across the globe. Top to bottom control over their supply chain. 

The company is about as perfectly run as you can expect from such a behemoth. It really is no surprise they are worth so much and in fact look like a value stock even with the valuation so high.

The Apple watch was cool, but it turns out that people don't really want to wear a watch, and I think they've sold as many as they are going to.  The MacBook seems to have gained little traction.  With the iPhone 8 and the X, it almost feels like they're jumping the shark, playing a remixed version of what made them a scad of cash in the good ol' days.

Oh, and by the way, it's not that I'm an Apple hater - I'm writing this message on an Apple.  Just as a stock, I've always been nervous about a fall.  Their product lines just don't feel diversified enough, meaning that if people ever get fatigued of the iPhone and they can't gain traction elsewhere, it's a long way down.";1514871293;ds2hkoz;t3_7nhc2r;0

UncleLongHair0;"You are focusing only on short-term considerations, if you're going to buy the stock and hold it for any period of time you need to look at the larger picture.

The technology industry is largely consolidated into about 6 huge companies which will probably control the consumer electronics marketplace for the foreseeable future.  The phone business is basically a duopoly with Apple and Samsung dominating the market.  Smart phones are an essential product for most of the developed world and this won't change.

Each dominant technology company has one or two products that dominate a category and a bunch of other add-on businesses that benefit from the dominant product.  Microsoft has Windows; Google has search; Apple has iPhones; FaceBook, Twitter, IG etc have their portals.  These companies can readily defend their businesses and it's unlikely anything will come along to take them away or replace them.

Apple has an enormous amount of cash in part because it can't effectively invest it, and it is so huge now that it has to do something to grow.  At a market cap of nearly $900 billion, it has to grow the size of Netflix (market cap $90 billion) just to provide a 10% return.  Even growing the size of GE (market cap $150 billion) would be a 15% return.  They will be able to grow their phone business to some extent but will have to find new areas of growth also.

I don't disagree with this statement at all. However, I think you've got a terrible investment strategy if you plan on shorting based on the current yield spread. 

Historically, from today's yield spread level you'd have to wait 13-78 months for a recession to begin, an average of 45 months (3.8 years). Using SP500 Total Returns for the same periods you would miss out on about 1.7% return per month or 76% in total return on average, from the time the yield curve crosses the current level until the recession begins. The average drawdown for any of those recessions was 19.5%. The only recession where it would have saved you from a loss greater than missed gains was in the 2008/2009 crash where you might have been better off by only 15% in total return. 

I'm assuming you just sit in cash. Shorting anything is going to have much higher costs and make the tradeoff even worse. Treasuries would be a better option. I didn't run the calcs but I still doubt they would make up for 76% in missed gains prior to each recession. 

I've got a model for probability of a recession with treasury spread as one of the inputs. It's currently far away from signalling a recession. I don't actually trade based on this model but if I did it's telling me there's zero risk of recession right now.

Currently all of the indicators are below the threshold signals (""zero risk""). The probabilistic model is at 20% recession probability which is about as low as it ever gets unless all the signals are at historical extreme levels all at once. The threshold model has higher accuracy but does not make the best trading strategy signal because it produces more whiplash trades and more abrupt risk on/off transitions. The probabilistic model produces a smooth signal which can be used to gradually adjust allocation. ";1514893902;ds2r07c;t3_7nhjnm;2

If you'd like to go this route, do some research into dividend stocks--there's a lot of stuff out there on growth vs yield, etc. If you haven't already, open an IRA so your dividends aren't taxed as income and keep it there. Depending on how much you have available to invest you can contribute $5500 for 2017 until April, and also another $5500 for 2018. I would say pick blue chip dividend stocks.

&gt;On the ex-dividend date, the exchange reduces the stock price by the amount of the dividend to account for the fact that new investors are not eligible to receive dividends and are therefore unwilling to pay a premium. However, if the market is particularly optimistic about the stock leading up to the ex-dividend date, the price increase this creates may be larger than the actual dividend amount, resulting in a net increase despite the automatic reduction. If the dividend is small, the reduction may even go unnoticed due to the back and forth of normal trading.

&gt;Many people invest in certain stocks at certain times solely for the purpose of collecting dividend payments. Some investors purchase shares just before the ex-dividend date and then sell them again right after the date of record – a tactic that can result in a tidy profit if it is done correctly.

As for china risk why would you not want to have some money in china? From my month of 'studying' seems like people like to diversify in everything?  or is there something really wrong with china I am not aware of?

Not sure what you mean by 'direct and indirect' 

Sorry if my reply is a bit dumb still getting used to the 'investing vocabulary' 

";1514889955;ds2pj34;t3_7nih1t;2
Dragonlordsk8er;"Been researching your comment for a bit now Going to tackle the china risk part of your comment.

I don't think it's that big of an issue or is it? because When I checked the geographic location of stock etf (80% of my portfolio) china isn't there :

United States: 59.10%,
Japan: 8.83%,
United Kingdom: 6.59%,
France: 3.97%,
Germany: 3.64%,
Canada: 3.56%,
Switzerland: 2.98%,
Australia: 2.56%,
Hong Kong: 1.34%,
Netherlands: 1.32%,
Spain: 1.19%,
Cash and/or Derivatives: 0.32%,
Other: 4.60%,

When I checked The bond etf (20% of my portfolio) there only seems to be 3.9% of the bond etf in china. Which if my math is correct 20% of 3.9% is 0.78% in china risk.

Mexico: 5.97%,
Indonesia: 4.96%,
Turkey: 4.30%,
Russian Federation: 4.21%,
Argentina: 3.96%,
China: 3.90%,
Philippines: 3.88%,
Brazil: 3.72%,
Colombia: 3.48%,
Kazakhstan: 3.21%,
Peru: 3.17%,
Ecuador: 3.12%,
South Africa: 3.11%,
Ukraine: 3.04%,
Dominican Republic: 2.72%,
Oman: 2.69%,
Hungary: 2.68%,
Lebanon: 2.67%,
Poland: 2.58%,
Malaysia: 2.40%,
Egypt: 2.36%,
Uruguay: 2.21%,
Panama: 1.84%,
Sri Lanka: 1.73%,
Chile: 1.72%,
Croatia (Hrvatska): 1.54%,
Romania: 1.51%,
Azerbaijan: 1.28%,
Lithuania: 1.21%,
Venezuela: 1.13%,
Jamaica: 1.12%,
Cash and/or Derivatives: 1.44%,
Other: 11.18%,

Now I'm not certain what the issue with china is but I don't think 0.78% is that much or is it? (I don't mean to come of offensive I'm a full on idiot on investing)

For the 'business cycle risk' comment If I understood properly what it means is basically a crash like the 2008 crash right?

Well my plan though I did not mention it (forgot to add it) was that I already have about 20,000 saved (in my country that's basically equivalent to 2 whole years of working without spending a single dime) was to I start putting money in this portfolio that I am earning now. leaving those 20k in the bank till a crash happens than spend the majority to buy a lot while the prices are low.

The reason why I don't just wait for a crash before going in well

1) to start understanding how the platform and all this stuff works (as as I said I never dealt with this stuff and neither have any of my family members or friends)

2) I've been reading a lot on not timing the market meaning like a crash could happen tomorrow but it could also happen in 20 years from now. And the drop might not even come down to what the current prices are if you know what I mean.

By direct and indirect I still have no idea what you mean haha

Fact is, we are all here to make money, and here exist a new market, within it, the ebb and flows of market psychology - human psychology at its essence, is constant. The same human psychology that makes the stock market go up and down exist here as well. So the same investor looking into stocks is looking at the same parameters here in Crypto. What's different is the Crypto market has exploded into the scene and everyone is in a euphoric state of mind.

1) They provide diversity with the click of a button. I like stock picking, but I'll be the first to admit that I might not be good at it. Buying index funds means at least those holdings will roughly match the market's returns.
2) They provide a way to get exposure to things that I don't feel confident evaluating on my own. I'm utterly confused by REITs for example. I get lost in their financials, and then my hands get sweaty thinking about all that debt. But as an asset class I feel they're useful since they're not quite an equity and not quite a bond (I know they're classified as equities but they have a pretty unique correlation).

ElvisWayCool;"1. I get, I just don’t see how it’s different from any other form of investment. MFs are similar, just buying stocks would be the same. An ETF just makes it easier to invest in all of the s&amp;p500 at once instead of buying each company’s stock separately.

2. So you think there’s some anti-downturn companies out there that ETFs don’t invest in? Why wouldn’t ETFs just buy into those too? There’s definitely dividend driven ETFs.

3. Most people probably consider retirement investing “business” instead of “fun”. Fun sort of implies emotional involvement, which is generally avoided in most investment strategies. Fear/greed are emotions that can lead to bad investment decisions, fun makes it sound like you’re still on the greed binge and just haven’t lost yet.

ElvisWayCool;"1. You’re also less diversified and probably spending a ton more time on analysis. If you pick individual stocks and you pick one that tanks you’re fucked. If you’re investing in the whole s&amp;p500, you’re not as fucked even if the biggest companies tank. Your example was people lazily throwing cash into SPY. I don’t think they’d be any less lazy if ETFs didn’t exist, they’d just be lazily throwing cash into AAPL or AMZN.

2. I mean, if you can on average out-perform an ETF, yeah, don’t invest in it. Same thing with mutual funds. I don’t get your point here. This question sounds like you’re asking something similar to, “why do people invest in AMD when NVDA provides better returns? Can’t they analyze fundamentals?” An ETF, or MF, lets you save time by not evaluating every stock in the fund. Some people value the time they save on all that analysis more than the potential gain from that analysis. Not everyone enjoys analyzing financial statements all day long and they may have other things, like their careers, to focus on. And again, what if your analysis is wrong? 

3. I don’t think we could ever prove it, but I’d bet more financial professionals would call their job “business” over “fun”, given the choice. Same with almost any other profession. Sure, dumping money in an ETF isn’t challenging, but if it provides a good return then I’d consider that rewarding. I also don’t think that people dumping cash into ETFs are calling that strategy “business” or “fun”, but they’d probably lean towards “business” if those were the only 2 options given. Maybe I’m wrong but we’ll never satisfy each other’s doubts here, so I’m willing to agree to disagree if you don’t agree.

It sounds like you’re thinking of 2 generic people and fusing their opinions. Passive, “lazy” investors like ETFs because they save a lot of effort for their risk/reward. Active, “smart” investors would prefer individual stocks since they take the time to analyze each one to find the best risk/reward opportunities. Maybe the ETF-happy subreddits are getting to you. They aren’t the only choice and they aren’t infallible, but on average a person looking to save money for retirement can benefit greatly from investing in ETFs. 

Sounds like you should be running an ETF (or some other type of fund) instead of investing in it, at least based on your personality. Idk if your performance backs that up, but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt for now haha.";1514868098;ds2fhca;t3_7njclm;3

Mad_Physicist;"Not OP, but there are a number of ways to bypass that commission. Vanguard at least (and if memory serves, several other financial institutions) allow you to buy their etfs from an account with them for free.

RecordRains;"&gt;What are you suggesting here, that the best opportunities in the market are ETFs? I just don't know how that could possibility be true...

That's exactly what I'm saying, if you have a 3 year + horizon and no private information. And I'm being conservative. In a given sector, I have trouble seeing how you would pick an individual company even for a year without any private information that this company is better (or another is worst) than the sector's ETF. 

If you are day trading, then yea, ETF aren't the best. That's because that's trading faster than the information flow in a lot of cases. However, even then, day traders don't consistently beat ETFs over time. ";1514896649;ds2s5ew;t3_7njclm;1

The downside to ETFs, in my opinion, are systemic. If the vast majority of the market is indexes than it doesn’t matter how an individual stock performs because it is carried along by the index. That can’t be good for the market. Or at least, I do not believe it to be. 

But still, because I don’t fool myself into thinking I can consistently beat he market, I am invested in it, through ETFS.

For example, just because I don't know exactly what $SQ is planning I still understand their business model well enough to be reasonably confident that they will be able to continue to grow in the longterm, regardless of private information that might fluctuate the stock from week to week. I think private information is more important for shorter term plays.

Yea. To me, fees are the main issue. The best way would be to reproduce your own index which isn't too hard if you have the capital. 

&gt;As an example a technology ETF, might include SNAP, which I'd really rather not be invested in at all.

Why wouldn't you be invested in SNAP while investing in other tech. By that I mean, what are the specific characteristics that makes SNAP unattractive compared to others. In large sectors like tech you can probably find ETFs or other index funds that filter for these characteristics. If not, then yea, making your own index makes sense. But... Personally, I don't think I'm smart enough to beat the collective intelligence in what makes a good company. There are hundreds of thousands of people whose jobs it is to look at them and they aren't beating the market. 

I do invest in individual companies (both private and public), either because I like the company and want to be part of it, or because it's an industry I'm part of (pharma, biotech and Cannabis).

Basically all I'm saying is if you have a small portfolio then you're starting with a large advantage that institutional investors don't have, and if you also think through experience that you can likely at least match the market you're in a very good place to be investing in stocks.

You're using some quite depressing logic honestly.

kriptonicx;"&gt; Wasn't Buffett talking about if he personally only had to invest a million? I don't think he was talking about a random person or even a ""decent amateur.""

My point was that having a small portfolio is an advantage. It's much easier to get in and out of positions and take profits from small price fluctuations, and as I said you can take advantage of lesser known opportunities in small-cap stocks and you're also not limited by the liquidity of options.

I'm not saying Buffett is saying some random dude off the streets should expect 50% returns by investing in stocks. My point is just that while I agree there are really smart people in this game and you're unlikely to be one of them, the small individual trader does have a very real advantage over those really smart people which people like Buffett has spoken about. So it's a little more complicated than what the other guy here was making out.

I think people here think I believe that for the average dude investing in stocks is better than investing in index funds. I don't think that. What I think is that if you're a smart person (lets say top 2-5% of the public) with a portfolio under $1,000,000 it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect that you could beat or at least match the market on average by investing in stocks or playing with options. Obviously you shouldn't drive straight into options or stocks, but if you put say just 5% of your portfolio aside for stocks and options and see how you do over a period of a few years that wouldn't be the stupidest move.

At the end of the day people who are successful at this game have to take a risk at some point. If you don't want to be successful and are happy with average returns then give up now and put your money in an index fund and enjoy your 7% annually. But for some people do want the challenge. Maybe they'll only average 6% per year, but some might do double that. You're not going to know until you try, and as a small independent investor you do have some advantages which might even the playing field out somewhat.";1514917606;ds3836m;t3_7njclm;2

JPINFV;Yep. The problem with the MFs, especially at such a low initial investment, is that even if he had 3k, he would have to go all in with a 100% equity/0% stock portfolio, which can be dangerous. At least with ETFs with $1000, he could easily go 8% or 16% $BND and the rest in $VOO and have a relatively decent portfolio with lower EFs (it's hard to get specific percentages given no partial shares and limited capital). ;1514917453;ds37xyu;t3_7nmhtw;2

pied-piper;"Robinhood is suited for day trading (buying in and out of securities frequently). M1 is not a day trading app, its an investment platform. It is far superior to robinhood if your goal is to make a portfolio of companies that you would like to invest in for a good length of time and allowing the app to automatically allocate money in the specific weight and allocation you want. The dynamic rebalancing of M1 makes it so that any underweight security will have future deposits or dividends invested into it until your pie is balanced. It doesn't sell shares to balance unless you manually tell it to do that. 

The fractional shares is a great feature because it can give you exposure to companies with expensive shares (like amazon). And it allows your allocation of funding to be dispersed far more evenly across your holdings. 

Here's an example of my portfolio: https://i.imgur.com/LiLX8aS.png

I pick what I want my pie of companies/funds to be and it will work to balance it with future funding. Right now you can see the pie is not balanced because I just changed around some of the allocation percentages. It will be balanced after my deposit tomorrow though.

Schwab has target allocation funds too, for all-in-one. Both index and non-index versions, with $1 minimums on the index versions, $100 on the non-index. 

Schwab has a huge assortment of no-commission ETFs from themselves and elsewhere, and has significantly lower stock commissions for the ETFs (and any stocks) you might want that are not commission free.

Still giving credit to Vanguard for being the firm that disrupted the investing field and brought indexing to the public mind - but that was decades ago.

What you do is you contact your brokerage and have them move the position from your margin to your TFSA.   Assuming your position is in a positive position the transaction triggers whats called ""Deemed Disposition"".  Any taxes owed from capital gains up to the point the transaction is processed will be issued to you in your annual statement that you use in your 2017 tax filing.

NRE accounts are fully repatriable so she can bring the money back to the US as well. A good primer on these two types of accounts can be found here:

Of course you can buy ADRs on NYSE but if you want to buy ordinary shares off the Indian stock exchanges, you need to open an account in India and there is ridiculous amount of red tape you need to jump through.

lihaoza;"Do you think the 0.93% expense ratio on INDY is worth it? I am not being facetious I really just want to know what you think. Like you said, INDY just tracks Nifty, but based on that I was not sure what explained the relatively high expense ratio. Is it just because it is difficult for foreign investment to enter India? 

Also do you think INDY is well weighted in terms of an ETF that will be able to track the general economy since it is dominated by banks? ";1514961953;ds49yvz;t3_7nokyj;1
wanmoar;"Compare it to the other Nifty ETF's on the market from other providers or other broad cap India ETF's (INDA, INP). Expense ratio's are determined largely by the following things in my experience:

- Competition: If you're the only etf on the market for a particular niche, you can charge what you want, to a degree. Something like BOTZ has the ability to charge higher fees than QQQ
- Structure: Options and futures and swaps based etf's are more expensive to run than something that goes and buys the underlying stocks outright
- Component Churn: the more often the etf re-balances the higher the trade costs and higher the fees. This can be most often seen in the fees for currency hedged etf's.
- Operational Choices: Any amount of fussing with the index adds costs. eg: Value SP 500 etc. 
- Size of the AUM: the fees pay the managers' salaries and bonuses. Those have some minimum amount so smaller etf's will need proportionally larger fees to cover those. Something like SPY can afford a 0.03% MER because it has an AUM of $230 Billion. That's $69 Million in revenue for salaries. More than enough.

On those factors a Nifty ETF shouldn't have that high a fee. I suggest looking around at INDA or INP as alternatives.

On the sector stuff I think it's fair to say you never get the general economy in an ETF regardless the country. The SP500 doesn't reflect the general economy of the US and neither does the Nifty. i think they both reflect the commercial economy of major urban areas to some degree but that's pretty much it. 

If you want to play the consumer angle in India as a US investor there are 2 Indian Consumer ETf's on the market at the moment. One from called Columbia something, not sure of the other. Just search 'India' on finviz. The other alternatives are the small cap etf (SMIN) whicih is interesting but I haven't gone through it yet. 

I don't think it's a bad thing to be dominated by banks since growth of banking usually would precede growth in the wider consumer economy in India. Now more than before because of demonetisation and how much everything seems to be based on centralised databases. just my $0.02";1514966447;ds4c32k;t3_7nokyj;2

klausshermann;"Theres two reasons you would buy a bond. 
1) You think spreads will tighten (yield/interest rate will decrease) before the maturity and you can thus sell at a higher price than you bought at. 
2) You think the bond is attractively priced with a high enough interest rate for its risk level compared to the market, so you buy and hold to maturity in which case you know how much you will receive at maturity and thus interest rate movements through the life of the bond don't matter";1514934480;ds3oagp;t3_7np00z;3
kiwimancy;"I have to explain to someone almost every day that long term bonds have interest rate hikes priced in. Interest rates ≠ yields. Yields are different at different maturities, collectively called the yield curve. Short term bonds are more correlated to interest rate movements (aka very short maturity yields) than long term bonds. But short term bonds have very low duration (a measure of how much the price moves for a given change in yield) unless you leverage them heavily which means they have a low sensitivity as well.  

For a 10+ year investment horizon, you should be looking to take advantage of risk premiums, not derisking, at least to a point. It's unclear if you're investing in stocks but I would recommend ~75% stocks for a 10 year term.";1514936744;ds3q9o0;t3_7np00z;5

All I could find about him was a long series of speeding tickets, misusing HOV lanes (driving in them himself.. what a swell guy), and defaulting on several small debts (probably figures creditors won't push too hard to collect on them). 

In any case, the resumes and personal backgrounds of nobody on Riot's management team looks anything close to a Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak or even a Bill Gates. They don't seem to be after anything other than short-term profits off of the backs of unsophisticated retail investors, and others who may be knowingly hoping to get rich off of a Ponzi scheme.";1514927525;ds3hrrj;t3_7npd0n;1

E-gold was a digital gold currency operated by Gold &amp; Silver Reserve Inc. (G&amp;SR) under e-gold Ltd. that allowed users to open an account on their web site denominated in grams of gold (or other precious metals) and the ability to make instant transfers of value (""spends"") to other e-gold accounts. The e-gold system was launched online in 1996 and had grown to five million accounts by 2009, when transfers were suspended due to legal issues.

Off the top of my head that could message passing and async i/o heavy programs.  Pre-Sandy Bridge processors are going to take a bigger hit since they lack PCID functionality as well.

I'm not sure regarding Redis and PostgresSQL specifically but another area that could be seeing a big hit is lazy memory allocation too and that might be something that could be patched in the kernel or the applications themselves.  This is still a newly publicized bug that came to light during a major holiday period and things are pretty far off from a fully optimized software solution.  This is all triage right now.

I don't know what other options there are patch wise.  Best case scenario Intel would either have an unlisted behavior specific MSR that could be changed via the firmware at boot time but it seems like this has been known about and held close  for at least a month and a half without major vendors pushing new bios to fix it so that seems unlikely.

vDSO (virtual dynamically linked shared object) is a kernel mechanism for exporting a carefully selected set of kernel space routines to user space applications so that applications can call these kernel space routines in-process, without incurring the performance penalty of a context switch that is inherent when calling these same kernel space routines by means of the system call interface.

vDSO has been developed to offer the vsyscall features and to overcome its limitations: small amount of allocated memory allowing only 4 system calls and same addresses ABI in each process compromising security. This security issue has been by emulating a virtual system call introducing a penalty latency.

vDSO uses standard mechanisms for linking and loading i.e.

ObservationalHumor;"The extent to which the IO impact can be mitigated depends heavily on the type of IO being done and how it's handled in user space here.  The only overhead that the fix introduces is at the kernel to user boundary not direct I/O throughput, which is pretty much all DMA these days anyways.

It's possible to simply do fewer reads and writes by using larger userspace buffers or simply memory mapping files to user space in the first place for example.  It's also possible that this is already being done but that current implementations are using 'lazy' style evaluation to actually pull pages into user space on demand which incurs similar overhead for each page load since the page fault handler also does a user -&gt; kernel -&gt; user transition.

Ultimately there's likely workarounds for this but they're going to take time to implement and many will occur outside of the kernel.  Again this is a huge pain the ass for developers impacted by these changes but necessarily insurmountable problems in many cases.

The reason games and other resource heavy applications are minimally impacted is because they're already high optimized to do I/O and self manage memory without invoking the kernel much.  As /u/dragontamer5788 mentioned they also rely heavily on user space hardware access where appropriate.  Games in particular have relied on direct GPU and sound card access for ages, that's actually where the whole DirectX naming convention came from.  If you're actually doing extremely high throughput networking stuff you're going to be accessing things directly and flat out polling the hardware instead of dealing with interrupts too.  Solutions exist for most of these problems they just weren't used outside of gaming and HPC environments because syscall latency wasn't previously a problem for anyone else.

&gt;Say that stocks are expected to return 8% long term and bonds are currently yielding 2%.  

This is almost never a construct that we'd see in reality.  Risk premiums have averaged generally less than that and by all accounts are falling. 



&gt;This is only true over long periods of time where the volatility of the stock market evens out.

This is also incorrect.  Volatility compounds over time so your expected terminal wealth range expands greatly with higher volatility portfolios.  Hence why time diversification is generally considered a poor argument unless one samples specific timeframes in specific markets. 


  &gt;But for someone who is 26 that is almost sure to happen.

This is demonstrably false for anyone who didn't experience accumulation during the last 30-40 years in the US.  Outside of that particular period markets don't behave at all like you describe so advice based on that is misguided at best. ";1514947705;ds3zvh2;t3_7nqrj8;7

The return for bonds (i.e. treasuries) is easily determined by their coupon which is currently 2-3% depending on which bonds you're looking at.

The return in the stock market in any one year is unlikely to be the same as its historical average, but the longer you hold, the closer it becomes.  For a 25 year old with a 40+ year investment horizon, holding stocks over the long term is extremely likely to provide this return.

Dude don't be ridiculous, that isn't true at all.  There are tons of decade long periods where real equity returns are at or close to zero.  There are multiple 20+ year periods where fixed income returns eclipsed equity returns.

A simple TVM calculation for an annuity.

1.	You are twenty and are saving $10,000 a year that you invest at the end of the year. For simplicity’s sake and being nice to people who make our meals, we don’t compound monthly.
2.	You will work for forty years. 
3.	You have an option between going 100% equity or going 80/20 split. 
4.	Conservatively assuming historical rates of S&amp;P500 and 30-Year Treasuries at 9.8% and 6.9% respectively. Note that this is a much closer grouping than you would get today, thus again arguing against myself on purpose. 

For equity only we get:   
&gt;	10 * ((1 + 0.098)^40 - 1)/0.098 = 4192.01k USD

For 80-20 mix we get:
&gt;	10 * ((1 + 0.098 * 0.8 + 0.069 * 0.2)^40 - 1)/(0.098 * 0.8 + 0.069 * 0.2) = 3584.34k USD

UncleLongHair0;"Bond returns have beat stocks for periods as long as 10 years, but OP is in his 20's and is investing for retirement and so has a horizon of 40 years.  Bonds have never beat the return of stocks over such a time period.  This is rooted in the fact that the US economy has numerous long term tail winds and has grown for over 100 years and outstrips the return provided by secure investments. He is also in the US and is investing in the US markets.

""Investing in bonds"" is ambiguous, it could mean buying long bonds, or short bonds, or a bond fund, or a portfolio of bonds, corporate bonds, government bonds, commercial paper, even most money market funds are basically bonds.  But most people mean a mixed total bond fund like VBMFX.  Funds like this have underperformed stocks in virtually every period of longer than 10 years in history. The people that buy these funds are looking for security, income, and lack of volatility because they don't have the time frame to ride out stock market volatility.

This will be especially true when bond yields are at 100+ year lows, since bond returns decline as yields increase.  There has essentially been a 30-40 year bull market in bonds, during which time yields on average fell, that is coming to an end, since yields can only go up from here.

You will have to provide some explanation of ""volatility compounds"". Volatility means a short term change in value, which can go both up and down.  The stock market has up and down years and the more years in the time frame, the more the results revert to the mean.  Someone investing with a 40 year time frame should not care at all about extreme volatility in the early years because it is meaningless to their overall returns, though they will have trouble acknowledging that at the time.  For example someone who had their life savings in the stock market in 2007 and was not due to retire for 10 years would have had no problem with the market downturn in 2008 as long as they didn't sell or do anything stupid.  Time is on the side of the stock market investor.  ";1514953706;ds44qc8;t3_7nqrj8;8

I'm gonna stick the next part because I've already addressed why just citing return misses the point completely. 

&gt;This will be especially true when bond yields are at 100+ year lows, since bond returns decline as yields increase.  There has essentially been a 30-40 year bull market in bonds, during which time yields on average fell, that is coming to an end, since yields can only go up from here.

You can replace the word ""bonds"" with ""stocks"" in that paragraph and have it still be 100% true.  The important factor is the relationship between equities and fixed income.  Namely the fact that they're uncorrected during periods of declining markets.


&gt;You will have to provide some explanation of ""volatility compounds"". Volatility means a short term change in value, which can go both up and down.  

Im not trying to be mean but idk what to tell you.  The explanation is that it compounds and the investor's range of expected terminal values increases exponentially with risk. 


Someone investing with a 40 year time frame should not care at all about extreme volatility in the early years because it is meaningless to their overall returns,

I think perhaps this is where your misunderstanding comes from.  The ""long term"" is really just a collection of short term periods.  If one experiences ""extreme volatility"" in a beginning period(ie a lot of loss) then they have less going in to the next period.  This continues indefinitely. 



&gt; For example someone who had their life savings in the stock market in 2007 and was not due to retire for 10 years would have had no problem with the market downturn in 2008 as long as they didn't sell or do anything stupid.  

Two critiques.  If one had invested in a mixed portfolio in 2007 they'd have essentially the same return through 2017 with less drawdown so you're illustrating my point here.  More importantly you're still exhibiting sample bias even though I pointed that out a few responses ago.  Run the same scenario with any other market through the GFC and the results are far less encouraging.  There's no logical reason to expect the US to not exhibit similar characteristics at some point.

If you get an 8% annual return on average, 50x leverage at 8% gives you an average return of 400%, which is great if we're only looking at returns and ignoring risk.

I think you see a problem here with being 50x leveraged, but in case you don't: if the underlying asset ever drops by 2%, your entire portfolio would be wiped out and you'd have a -100% return, even though on average you'd have a 400% return.

Interest rates are still artificially low, because the FED will take years to back out the massive suppression of interest rates they did to hold the stock market up through the period in which the economy couldn't hold the stock market up.  Now the economy can.  But undoing what the FED did must be slow.  
  
Bonds will lose out to inflation.  The government continues to understate true inflation.  Bonds are not really safe.  They have lots of down side potential, much of which overlaps with the downside of stock, but they lack any up side.  
  
For money you must spend in the next ten years, bonds may be a necessary evil:  Accept the likelyhood of losing a little to inflation to reduce the risk of losing a lot to poor market timing.  
  
The prevailing idea in this forum, is that one value of bonds in times like this is that they give you room to shift toward stocks at the next market low.  This seems to make sense even recognizing that today you can't predict when that low will be.  But it fails to make sense once you understand that even when that next low has arrived you still won't know.  The low and the period of drop leading to the low are only different in hindsight.

kiwimancy;"Yield and price are mathematical inverses. But interest rates ≠ yields. Yields are different at different maturities, collectively called the yield curve. Short term bonds are much more correlated to interest rate movements (aka ultra short maturity yields) than long term bonds. But short term bonds have very low duration (a measure of how much the price moves for a given change in yield) which means they have a low sensitivity as well unless you leverage them heavily.  

Central banks have control over rates but they can only influence long bonds with quantitative easing which has very limited effectiveness. Tightening interest rates tends to drag on stocks as well as bonds and has been a contributing factor in past crashes. But there's a chicken and egg problem in determining causation.

Early in an investor's life the only thing that matters is total return.  The ""safety"" of bonds is not safety at all but decreased return, which only leaves you with less money in the end.  There is no point in being ""safe"" holding 10-20% bonds in year #10 of a 40 year time frame because that year will be a distant memory when you withdraw the money.

UI and usability will continue to improve - it’s already way better now than it was a few years ago. 

As the tech improves, the public and merchants will slowly get on board, and the price will stabilize. There won’t be some magic day where you can declare bitcoin is finally here, it’s just going to sneak up on people like the internet did.

Smart people, sure, but I'm not sure about the ""greatest minds in the world"".

&gt; this guys has seen a YouTube video of someone talking shit about the current state

No actually. I've been investing in Bitcoin on and off for years and I have a couple of friends who have recently become millionaires after investing in the Eth ICO (something I obviously massively regret not getting involved with when they advised me to). Not just that, I work in tech and I understand better than most people the advantages and disadvantages of the technology. I'm not trying to claim I'm an expert, but I'm not some idiot who saw a YouTube video either. I'm not even bearish on Crypto in general, I just can't for the life of me understand the logic behind people investing in Bitcoin at this point in time.

As I said in my first comment, to see upside at this point in time Bitcoin has to make progress in either A, becoming an widely accepted and feasible alternative currency, or B, become a rival store of value to gold. Given the flaws in Bitcoin both are really silly bets to make in my opinion. It's also clearly in a bubble from the fact companies by simply adding ""blockchain"" to their name will quadruple overnight.

Although to be fair, I regret using the word stupid because that's probably a little harsh a word.";1514993711;ds4pw6g;t3_7nu81d;1
cb_hanson_III;Not a store of value nor unit of account given the price volatility. Not even a very good medium of exchange given very limited transaction speed/throughput.

cb_hanson_III;Not unsolvable. But the best party to solve most of them would likely be the government issuing cryptocurrencies. For small transactions it can be digital cash (which could preserve anonymity if designed that way) but for larger deposit accounts, they would obviously know who you are. So not a distributed blockchain, but there are huge advantages to society of maintaining regulatory oversight and control (far less tax evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing, other illicit activities) and also maintaining the peg to USD (say in the case of the Fed). Also very real, monetary policy benefits. Perhaps not a popular opinion given the original intent of Nakamoto, but that's they way it will probably go.;1514999098;ds4uuyo;t3_7nu81d;1
Nonethewiserer;"Anonymity and scalability aren't problems for some other cryptos NOW, yet Bitcoin's ""market cap"" blows all of them out of the water. 

It's not priced for it's utility. The appeal if Bitcoin is that it's exploded in price.";1514999306;ds4v25t;t3_7nu81d;1
Nonethewiserer;Of course they are, evidenced by the other cryptos that have already solved them. Yet Bitcoin is valued much more highly which demonstrates the price doesn't reflect it's utility.;1514999441;ds4v730;t3_7nu81d;1
Darius510;"....for now. Like any other software, it will improve. There also happens to be a huge amount of ideas on how to scale it that are currently being tested in the wild by other currencies. If they prove themselves - there’s no IP or patents standing in bitcoins way, they can literally copy and paste code from the GitHub of any of their competitors. 

Imagine if Pfizer could just copy the molecular structure of a breakthrough drug at zero cost and put their marketing weight behind it. They’d save all the costs of R&amp;D and testing, and they’d pretty much bury the startup that came up with the drug. They wouldn’t even need to pay a cent to acquire their IP. That’s the enviable position bitcoin is in right now - you’d be crazy to bet against that. ";1514999777;ds4vimx;t3_7nu81d;1
Darius510;"A slow currency 100,000 people accept has far more utility than a fast currency only 1,000 people accept.

Darius510;"All blockchain/crypto adds to the system is the ability to do it in a decentralized fashion. Otherwise it’s just a super inefficient database. If you’re going to introduce centralized elements like government control then there is literally no point to a blockchain anymore, just use a database. 

Lots of governments and corporations have studied it, and none are using it. Why? Because their research has led them to the same conclusion. At best they’d implement “crypto in name only” like Ripple. But I still don’t see what it would accomplish other than to give the appearance of being state of the art while actually changing nothing meaningful. ";1515000929;ds4wneg;t3_7nu81d;1
[deleted];[deleted];1515001171;ds4wvzs;t3_7nu81d;1
cb_hanson_III;I agree that for government backed digital money in the form of deposit accounts it can just be a centralized database. But even that form (while not using blockchain) would bring lots of efficiencies that proponents of Bitcoin get excited about. If you wanted to maintain some anonymous government backed currency (so anonymous like paper money but in digital form), however, you might want to implement a decentralized, blockchain system.;1515001348;ds4x2bd;t3_7nu81d;1
Darius510;"If proponents of bitcoin are trying to sell it on performance/efficiency vs the current system, they’re bullshitting. (And they probably know it.)

Anonymous government backed crypto makes no sense. Why would the government want to do that when you’ve just given a whole bunch of reasons why they obviously wouldn’t want to? And more importantly, why would anyone want to use an “anonymous” government crypto when they can use a truly decentralized crypto that can’t be undermined or controlled by anyone?";1515001639;ds4xcqj;t3_7nu81d;1
cb_hanson_III;"&gt; Why would the government want to do that when you’ve just given a whole bunch of reasons why they obviously wouldn’t want to? 

For access reasons (e.g. lower income people in many countries are unbanked, older people might have a hard time dealing with mobile apps, etc). They could balance the other concerns by limiting the amount that can be converted in this anonymous currency.

&gt; why would anyone want to use an “anonymous” government crypto 

Legal tender status and stable value with respect to, say, USD. ";1515001914;ds4xmgd;t3_7nu81d;1
Darius510;"And then that immediately begs the question of why anyone would use that watered down cryptocurrency when the real deal already exists?

And how do they control the amount you can convert when it’s supposed to be anonymous?";1515002091;ds4xsmj;t3_7nu81d;1
cb_hanson_III;"I think it would be the other way around. The government backed crypto currency would have lots of advantages over Bitcoin and alternatives. If the government announced the issuance of Fed-backed cryptocurrency, the value of all the other ""watered down"" cryptos would likely crash.";1515002183;ds4xvvn;t3_7nu81d;1
Darius510;"If the government announced fed backed crypto anyone who thought it through would laugh, because its absurd. It would accomplish nothing but combining the worst of both worlds.

How are these crypto dollars any more useful than a bank account with a debit card? Because anyone who doesn’t have access to those is not living in a place where the government is trustworthy, and those are the people who would be even more inclined to use truly decentralized crypto. They might have to do it in secret and/or exchange bitcoin for the local government crypto for day to day, because presumably this would have to come hand in hand with banning bitcoin and other real cryptos. But again this would accomplish little but the appearance of the benefits of crypto.

The only government backed crypto I’m aware of is Venezuela’s oil backed crypto - and its no accident that they had to back it by a physical resource vs government faith (because they have none.). And Venezuelan’s *love* bitcoin right now....and that’s no coincidence either. ";1515002728;ds4yf7g;t3_7nu81d;1
cb_hanson_III;"The Swedes are very seriously looking into this just to give one example. They are not a banana republic, but instead are motivated by the fact that their country is rapidly going cashless.

What you are missing is that developed country governments are currently tolerating Bitcoin etc and taking a hands off approach because they are not really used in the economy for transactions in any meaningful way. Should that change and they start to be used in substantial amounts, the government / central banks would be very interested in regulating them and offering their own alternatives. Are you so naive to think that the government will not exert control over such an important sovereign aspect of their economy? Do you think they are willing to lose control over their own country's monetary policy? Come on...";1515002921;ds4ym20;t3_7nu81d;1
Darius510;Do Swedes not have debit cards or mobile payment apps already? ;1515002981;ds4yo3e;t3_7nu81d;1
Darius510;I think totalitarian governments will try (and mostly succeed.) I think democratic governments are at the mercy of their constituents, and will regulate it to the extent that people will tolerate it. Every mistake they make that hurts people will push people towards non-governmental currency. At best they buy some time to adapt to a world where state and money are separate. That’s way off in the far flung future though. ;1515003302;ds4yyzb;t3_7nu81d;1
cb_hanson_III;Sure they do. That's what is allowing the country to go cashless. The central bank there is very concerned and studying various proposals to introduce central bank crypto. The big question that makes central bankers pause is what will happen to existing commercial banks if you start competing with them for deposits... There will be tons of lobbying from the financial institutions.;1515003390;ds4z23c;t3_7nu81d;1
cb_hanson_III;Why would we (citizens) want the central bank to lose control of monetary policy?? Yes I understand that in some countries in say South America, they don't have credibility. But most of us living in developed country DO want our government to be able to respond when the business cycle takes a downturn or worse. With central bank crypto, you would potentially have much more effective monetary policy since stimulus would not need to be intermediated through the banking system.;1515003792;ds4zga8;t3_7nu81d;1
Darius510;I don’t think you’ve thought this through. Crypto isn’t a replacement for the units, it’s a replacement for the system. If you have an account with 10 dollars or whatever, its just a ledger with your bank that says you have 10 dollars to your account. You can withdraw it for a ten dollar bill. If you “withdrew” it to a crypto wallet....you’re basically just transferring from one digital account to another. You’d have to access it through a payment card or mobile app - which is what you already do with your bank account. It’s adding a layer of complexity for no reason whatsoever. ;1515003831;ds4zhm3;t3_7nu81d;1
cb_hanson_III;The difference is that with a bank account, you are not actually holding government reserves. Hence there is a need behind the scenes to settle the payments. So it's really not the same thing. Arguably it's the current commercial banking system that is adding the unnecessary layer of complexity (as well as major amounts of systemic macro risk to the economy as we saw in the financial crisis). Things would be easier (in concept) if we all had accounts directly with the government.;1515004878;ds50j85;t3_7nu81d;1
Darius510;Because with stimulus comes inflation/taxation, and you’re personally better off not holding the inflated currency backed by a govt even more in debt. From a collective perspective there’s a case to be made, but as long as people have a choice they’ll prefer a stable/deflationary store of value vs one that can be arbitrarily inflated - even if it was done democratically with good intentions.  ;1515005370;ds510ey;t3_7nu81d;1
Darius510;But you don’t think that’s actually a good idea in practice, do you?;1515005739;ds51dwj;t3_7nu81d;1
cb_hanson_III;Where's the runaway inflation in the US after the Fed's actions during the financial crisis? There were far more problems when USD was on the gold standard.;1515005879;ds51j2i;t3_7nu81d;1
cb_hanson_III;There is lots to like about the concept although it would come at the price of less privacy. And we'd have to figure out how the provision of credit to individuals and businesses would work if commercial banks couldn't get cheap funding.;1515006014;ds51nyn;t3_7nu81d;1
Darius510;It doesn’t have to be runaway inflation to make a deflationary currency desirable on the individual level. Systematically you may be right but as long as people can individually benefit from sidestepping the system, they will. ;1515006068;ds51pwq;t3_7nu81d;1
cb_hanson_III;What's the advantage in your mind with a deflationary currency? Why not simply stable?;1515006336;ds51zmg;t3_7nu81d;1
Darius510;"There’s no such thing as truly stable unless the supply was perfectly static. 

The advantage of holding a deflationary currency should go without saying - it’s buying power increases with time rather than decreases. ";1515008516;ds546ng;t3_7nu81d;1
cb_hanson_III;"&gt; There’s no such thing as truly stable unless the supply was perfectly static.

It's the opposite actually. What's needed is for the central bank to adjust supply as needed to maintain stability. Do you think bitcoin will have stable value once it maxes out in terms of number of coins?";1515013985;ds59sty;t3_7nu81d;1

In general dividends are paid by more established companies that want to signal consistency. They are taken out of the earnings of the company (or their assets if their earnings fall too low) and given to the shareholder. If you hold a fund, the fund collects the dividends and must distribute them all to its investors for tax reasons.

The assumption is that at some point you'll hit the income cap and won't be able to contribute anymore, so it's better to start sooner rather than later.  The key to long term investment growth is time not timing--this forces you to not touch it.  I would do all 100% stock, but you can probably do 25% bonds to be on the safe side.    I would put a lump sum in there of about $2k or $3k and remember to max it out to $5.5k by end of year.  

THEN, if you have extra money left over, say...a couple thousand, then invest it into an easy to use, intuitive and informative platform like Betterment.  However, if you have more than $10k even after contributing to your Roth IRA, then I'd look into Vanguard ETFs instead.

I'm by no means an investment expert.  My parents were the ones who insisted I start a Roth IRA when I was 20 and I'm so grateful that they did.  I'm about to hit the income cap this year and I feel I'm ahead of the game compared to my peers.

All securities in a margin account are marginable, that is, they can be loaned to a third party and that third party can sell them (i.e. sell them short).  This is the fine print cost of having a margin account.  When a third party borrows your shares and sells them short, they are obligated to you for all dividends.  Dividends they reimburse to you, however, will not be qualified and will show up on your 1099 as ""substitute payments in lieu of dividends"" and will be taxed at ordinary income rates, regardless of holding period.  It doesn't happen for every security that you're long on, but the possibility is there in a margin account.";1515037641;ds5urd3;t3_7nu89z;2

xjx545;"Take my advice with a grain of salt, but I've always regarded annuities as a very bad idea, except for very narrow edge cases. They are tax disadvantaged and illiquid. They also are not great tax wise for your kids if they inherent it. If you stuff this into an index fund and never look at it again you will be completely set for retirement. Put that 500k into an ETF, and at a (below average) return of 8%, after 20 years you will have over 2 million dollars. Keep in mind though that year to year this may swing as much as 20%-40%, so what some funds do is start shifting allocations into bonds the closer you get to retirement. Something you may want to look into. 

As for the house, and potentially even the student loans, if the interest rate is 3-4%, don't even think of paying it off (unless for sentimental reasons). You're basically paying zero interest taking inflation and the tax deduction into account.  Also you need to start paying off those CCs because they affect your DTI and also your ability to get good interest rates if you want to buy an investment property down the road.

I think realistically you can expect 5-10% annually return from any investment. So your $2,000 will become $2,200 at best. 

NOW, I love to gamble so I personally am looking to throw $1,000 at high risk penny stocks and trying to day trade knowing I’m going to lose it. I’ll let you know lol";1515135815;ds7tlh7;t3_7nu89z;3

This is only true if everything else stays the same though, as other international players may make even larger gains by a depreciation of their currency and thus price the US exporters out of the market in Europe for example.;1515148549;ds7z2qh;t3_7nu89z;1
dqingqong;"Regarding international allocation, why is it usually a bad idea to overweight certain countries, especially if those countries only account for a tiny fraction of the stock markets? Let's say you're Swedish, and you hold 20% of your portfolio in Swedish stocks/ETFs, instead of &lt;5% of the portfolio. ";1515159050;ds840f4;t3_7nu89z;1
kiwimancy;"Bonds are loans and entitle you to interest payments while the loan is outstanding plus a par value when the bond matures. The yield (yield to maturity for a single bond or SEC yield for a bond fund) is roughly the return you're going to get from it. But their price can still change in the marketplace and your return might be higher or lower than that.  

Stocks represent slices of ownership in a company. Some companies pay their shareholders some of their profits directly. That's called dividends. But that is only a part of the return that you get from them. They also reinvest their earnings into the company in order to grow and make even more money in the future. When that happens, their stock price rises and your return includes that rise. The market can also bid up or down the stock. That contributes to your return but it's fake in the sense that it isn't expected to contribute anything in the long run.  

Yield refers to dividends and bond payments. Neither yield, nor past 1 year return is a good representation of the long run average return you'll get on stocks going forward. Historical returns on stocks are 7% real + 3% inflation. Going forward you can expect lower returns since prices are high (simple measure [CAPE](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/)), so maybe 4% real + 2% inflation. But in any given year, stocks will often rise a lot or fall a lot, with a standard distribution of ~14%.  

The probability and size of how much they fall is called risk and is usually avoided because you want to have more certainty in your returns and because it hurts psychologically to lose a lot of money and because large losses in one period can heavily reduce total returns for many periods.  
But market risk and expected return over the long run are proportional. If you can withstand a certain level of risk, you want to take that much risk in your portfolio so you can get the highest return you can afford.  
Bonds also have some risk, but most bonds have a lot less than stocks.";1515161959;ds85vya;t3_7nu89z;2

Second, before you could build a cash pool you have to manage your spending. Have a mindset that if you have to pay in installments for any depreciating assets (like your car and phone), you should not buy it. If you force yourself to pay cash for big purchases it would force you into the habit of saving and force you to consider if the item is worth purchasing. Think of this another way, if you pay cash and avoid paying interest on debt (that is what installment payment is essentially) that is like making a risk-free 5-25% rate of return on an investment. Any investor would salivate for that kind of returns.

You can lever that portfolio up with the same risk adjusted returns to attain better absolute returns than a mostly stock portfolio at the same risk level.

Futures give you leverage at close to risk free rates as well as the ability to massively lever up on short term bonds which are more efficient than long term bonds.

kiwimancy;"The Fed decides a target for the [federal funds rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate) which is the rate that banks lend to each other at when they have excess reserves. They control this rate by [repurchase agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_market_operation) with banks to expand or contract the money supply. The overnight rate propagates out to what rate banks can lend to other organizations at and that propagates out to the full bond market - including the auctions of T-Bill by the Treasury. The Federal reserve bank does not directly control the discount rate of those T-Bills. (also technically t-bills don't have any coupons).  

To your second question, an ETF like BND (the ETF version of the mutual fund VBTLX) holds many bonds, some short, some long, some intermediate. Longer maturity bonds have a lot of expectations for rates built in and aren't affected by individual rate changes much. They move mostly based on inflation and growth expectations.  The [yield curve](http://stockcharts.com/freecharts/yieldcurve.php) shows you what the yields on different maturities are and you can also see that the curve does not move in the same direction at all maturities.  

Shorter bonds are more sensitive to individual rate changes. But they already have information about the Fed's schedule priced in, so you wouldn't lose value unless the Fed moves more aggressively than the market expected. If rates do move unexpectedly, short term bonds will indeed fall in price to a discount that brings them in line with the market's new higher yield.  ";1515379952;dscl6os;t3_7nu89z;1
WikiTextBot;"**Federal funds rate**

In the United States, the federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions (banks and credit unions) lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight, on an uncollateralized basis. Reserve balances are amounts held at the Federal Reserve to maintain depository institutions' reserve requirements. Institutions with surplus balances in their accounts lend those balances to institutions in need of larger balances. The federal funds rate is an important benchmark in financial markets.

***

**Open market operation**

An open market operation (OMO) is an activity by a central bank to give (or take) liquidity in its currency to (or from) a bank or a group of banks. The central bank can either buy or sell government bonds in the open market (this is where the name was historically derived from) or, in what is now mostly the preferred solution, enter into a repo or secured lending transaction with a commercial bank: the central bank gives the money as a deposit for a defined period and synchronously takes an eligible asset as collateral. A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy. The usual aim of open market operations is—aside from supplying commercial banks with liquidity and sometimes taking surplus liquidity from commercial banks—to manipulate the short-term interest rate and the supply of base money in an economy, and thus indirectly control the total money supply, in effect expanding money or contracting the money supply.

In building my portfolio ETFs definitely seem interesting especially since my broker (Degiro) offers some with no trading fees. However because of the new legislation implemented in the EU, I would have to buy UCITS ETFs or other Europe based ETFs which don't seem as appealing as those in the USA.

Why is it idiotic? The flip side of sometimes being say 2x long when conditions are favorable is being flat (or even occassionally short) when conditions are unfavorable. Idiocy imo is maintaining a constant equity allocation (say 90% or whatever) regardless of the environment. EVEN if you couldn't predict the mean returns, you could still outperform by forecasting volatility (which is MUCH easier to do - based simply on realized vol) and using that to adjust your stock allocation up/down.";1514988396;ds4ls1o;t3_7nuaxr;16

programmingguy;"I don't hold cash in my retirement accounts as they get automatically deployed into index funds biweekly. But having a little cash on the sidelines (3% to 5%) in my taxable brokerage accounts have always worked out for me with getting a chance to buy or add at lower prices when there is market turmoil. When I say market turmoil, I'm referring to individual stocks and not broad markets like the S&amp;P500 which is what outlets look at when they speak of corrections and in that respect, they keep saying that there hasn't been a market correction since forever. I'm a buy-the-dip guy for long term holdings in bluechips which I feel are fundamentally sound. I have my sector specific watchlists and am ready to pull the trigger when there is market mayhem.

Cash in 2017 was vital for me in my taxable accounts... there have been wild sector and individual stock price fluctuations to the downside due to typical fear mongering and exaggerated analyst speculation that have opened up opportunities for getting in at far lower prices.

My mother was a brilliant investor for most of her life.  That changed when she cashed out massive gains before the 2001 crash.  Sounds like the right thing to do, but it worked out horribly.  She paid massive tax on those realized gains, then she bought what she thought was safer at what she thought was the bottom.  But the stocks she bought back into kept falling while those she had sold recovered to above where she sold them.  
  
Ignoring tax impact, that disaster took only a minor chunk out of the results of decades of beating the indexes.  But the tax impacts made it much worse.  She paid massive taxes on cashing out at the right moment.  But having bought back at the wrong time, her portfolio was far behind for the rest of her life and the cost basis reset meant none of the taxes she paid on those gains were returned when the gains were destroyed by later losses.  
  
If you sell out at the top and buy back at the bottom, you can be happy ignoring the tax impact.  But you are likely to miss the top when selling and likely to miss the bottom when buying back.  At the ""slightly rich"" level where the $3K per year loss limit is a trivial fraction of any major portfolio turnover, the tax impact is a big reason to avoid that attempt at market timing.  Guess right and the IRS takes their share.  Guess wrong and the IRS doesn't share your loss.  
  
I'm never going to time a major interval in cash well enough to be worth that tax risk.  When the market drops, I'm much happier to lose unrealized gains that were never taxed than to wrack up massive unrealized losses on the after-tax portion of previously taxed gains.  Do note that is ""happier"" not ""happy"".  No one wants to lose.  But if you realize you needed to take that risk to get any gains, then you can be sensible about managing what you lose.  
  
I happen to have ""too much"" cash at the moment (about 10%), not because I am trying to time the overall market, nor because I think now is a good time to have 10% cash.  It just worked out that way because of the way I react to events in individual stocks.";1515012910;ds58nus;t3_7nuaxr;4

Staples: GIS

Retail Pharma: WBA, CAH, CVS

Tech: FB, AMZN, TXN, IBM

Airlines: ALK

Oil: XOM 

Telecom: T

The mention of Amazon destroyed  retailers and I added and started positions in some of these. When they dip nicely due to market overreaction, I add to a position. When they reach 52 week lows, I keep adding... if they go lower, I add. Sometimes these moves are triggered by an analyst echo chamber and Jim Cramer types...two weeks later they change their minds and the slightest positive news. I remember when Jim Cramer said that AMZN will destroy retail when they all tanked.  When the sector rotation happened with tech and retail shot up, he changed his tune on retail. These guys just go with the flow like most of us. IBM and XOM are more speculative... with the expectation that there will be turn around in IBM and XOM will benefit from higher oil prices:

Now there's no guarantee that the share price won't go wild again due to some piece of news. We're in a bull market so stuff like PEs probably don't matter while we're at it. But if you have income, a bear market can work in your favor over the long term when you buy low.

014a;"This flaw is beyond serious. I've seen the words ""catastrophic"" and ""apocalyptic"" thrown around in the tech circles, not because its being actively exploited but because the fix requires imposing a huge performance penalty at the OS level. 

This is going to impact every major cloud provider, all of which run almost completely on affected Intel chips. Every SaaS platform on cloud hardware will get slower overnight, and will have to increase their cloud spend to compensate (assuming their application can scale that easily, many can't). Consumer laptops, gaming rigs, anything which is especially sensitive to loading things from disk and memory paging. It's that bad. Some applications like databases could see up-to 30% drop in performance once the update hits. 

Everything is kind of hush-hush right now because no one knows the true impact its going to have. But we do know that AMD chips aren't affected. AMD might be up 9% right now, but its seeming likely that might be underpriced for what's coming in the next month. 

Update: [New information was released by Google Project Zero](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/01/todays-cpu-vulnerability-what-you-need.html). 

- [According to another blog post](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html), this vulnerability was reported to Intel in June 2017. Their CEO definitely knew, and moreover had an exceedingly long amount of time to get all the proper paperwork in a row. 

- There are two separate exploits; one named ""Meltdown"" which affects only Intel's CPUs and is patchable, but the patch comes with a performance penalty. 

- This is more critical: A second exploit named ""Spectre"" affects **all** CPUs produced by every major manufacturer, including AMD. It is unpatchable; processor manufacturers will need to rearchitect parts of their CPUs to avoid it, and its seeming likely that those rearchitectures will have performance penalties given that the exploit is in a performance optimization called speculative execution. Thankfully it is harder to exploit, but it still allows for untrusted code in one VM to escalate into the hypervisor and gain read-only access to another VM's memory on the same machine.

This is now the most dangerous, widespread, expensive new attack vector ever discovered, probably in the history of computing. Any company which sells virtual machines; Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc will have to replace every single processor in their data centers with new Intel or AMD chips that haven't been fabed yet.

JasonMckennan5425234;"This is what I used to do back in the day when I was low income. I was making like 23k per year working a crappy job so my long-term capital gains rate is 0%. Yes, 0%. So what I would do is sell all my stocks that had a long-term capital gain on them and then rebuy them in the following year.

Since you now have realized long-term capital gains, you report them on your taxes and you will pay 0% rate on those gains. Just make sure the total gain and taxable income does not exceed the 15% bracket (38,700 if you are single). You get realized capital gains and now your cost basis is higher.

Example:

You buy stocks for 10,000 ($10 per share, 1,000 total shares) and now it is worth 20,000 ($20 each share) after 366 days. You have a 10,000 unrealized gain and decide to sell all the stock for $20 each. You have a 10,000 long-term capital gain and since you are in the 15% tax bracket you qualify for 0% capital gain tax. In the following year, you repurchase the stocks for $20 each and your new cost basis is $20. If you never did this, your cost basis would still be $10 and your income might be higher which means you now have to pay 15% tax or 20%.

I did this practically every year and probably realized close to 25k in capital gains at a 0% rate.";1515014896;ds5ard5;t3_7nup48;5
lihaoza;"This is the right answer. Being able to anticipate higher future income (i.e. you are a student now but next year you will be making $100,000 a year) can let you front load capital gains in years where you have a low effective tax rate and save that tax basis for future years. 

Another possibility is to skirt the wash sale rules by selling one type of investment but buying another one that is highly correlated with it but not the same. For example you could sell TAN for a loss on 12/31 and then buy KWT on 01/01. They both track the solar sector and are therefore highly correlated with each other but have substantially different holdings and are likely not ""substantially identical security"" and would therefore likely not trigger wash sale. Then on 02/01 when the wash sale period expires you could either stick with KWT or even just sell it and use that cash to buy back TAN. ";1515045960;ds60i5b;t3_7nup48;1

JohnSpartans;Schwab actually has lower fees involved, dividends are smaller but really the differences are negligible since the cost of most Schwab ETFs are cheaper than vanguard's so you'll be getting more of them for the price.;1514997196;ds4t1mu;t3_7nv8u6;2
ChekovsWorm;"You will pay a $4.95 trading commission to Schwab every single time you buy or sell shares in each Vanguard ETF. The internal ""fees"" (expense ratio AKA management fees) within each ETF will be the same as at Vanguard, and you will never see them as separate ""fees"" at either place (they are factored into the NAV and thus indirectly into the market price per share.)

It's considered relatively foolish, as in wasting all the commission money for no reason whatsoever, to buy Vanguard ETFs at a non-Vanguard brokerage account, if you are able to open a Vanguard brokerage account.

Of course, Schwab has ""better"" ETFs than Vanguard in many cases, with lower fees (again, the internal expense ratio), with the same or functionally equivalent indexes as Vanguard, with no commission if bought in your Schwab Brokerage account. 

There is really no reason at all to want as Vanguard ETF if there is an equivalent Schwab-managed or Schwab OneSource no-commission marketplace of other-company ETFs that do the same (or extremely similar) thing. 

Other than the whole ""church of Vanguard"" thing on reddit.

The only significant thing missing at Schwab is a direct exact replacement for a ""standard"" S&amp;P500 Index ETF. Regular, market-capitalization weighted, 505 stocks chosen by the S&amp;P Index Committee from the largest-capitalization US-traded stocks.

Schwab does not have that exact equivalent to the Vanguard VOO ETF (or the equivalent free-at-Fidelity iShares IVV ETF, or the free nowhere and less-appropriate for individual buy-hold investors, more-for-traders, SPY ETF. Reasons for that description, won't go into them here.) 

Schwab DOES have exactly that as their SWPPX mutual fund for tracking the real S&amp;P500 index. As an ETF, they have the no-commission Guggenheim EQUAL WEIGHT S&amp;P500 RSP ETF, which looks quite different even though it covers the same 500 stocks, because it is frequently re-balanced to hold the same dollar amount of each stock. That prevents it from becoming primarily a FAAMG tech-heavy ETF, which is what the S&amp;P500 is right now, but ""it's not the S&amp;P500 Index"" as you know it.

However, either the free-of-commission Schwab Large Cap SCHX ETF, based on the largest 750 stocks in the Dow Jones Total Stock Market Index (which is NOT ""the Dow""), or the Schwab 1000 SCHK ETF, based on Schwab's near-clone of the Russell 1000 largest 1000 stocks, are perfectly rational substitutes for most normal investors who want a ""US stock index ETF"". 

For everything else the typical redditor investor might want from Vanguard ETFs, there absolutely is a Schwab no-commission ETF. Some, like the Schwab SCHF Developed foreign stock literally tracking the same index as Vanguard's VEA, with the same ""Developed World"" definition that includes South Korea (and thus Samsung, Hyundai, etc.), unlike everybody else's ""Developed World"" that still has Korea in Emerging Markets. Likewise same definition for Schwab Emerging Market SCHE ETF as Vanguard's Emerging Markets (VWO?) - the FTSE Indexes EM definition that excludes Korea because it's now developed.

Similar index ETFs for Domestic Real Estate, Schwab SCHH, especially now that Vanguard is finally fixing VNQ to be competitive with everybody else and include RE operating REITs not just RE-owning ones, more cell-tower and similar specialized REITS.

Domestic total bond - Schwab has equivalent BND (SCHO I think, I'm not in it and not logged in to check right now.)

Want a total market (domestic stock) ETF? Schwab SCHB is functionally equivalent to VTI (though doesn't map to exactly the same index, but also is cheaper to own and very similar performance.)

Basically, why do you want Vanguard ETFs if you choose to open your brokerage account at Schwab? 

Not asking the reverse question, because you already gave a good reason, the bank account, for Schwab. But also, Schwab is cheaper for stock and non-free ETF commissions, lower initial investment for mutual funds, lower fees for buying brokered FDIC insured CDs and treasury bonds. 

Why the want for Vanguard at this point?";1514999026;ds4usj4;t3_7nv8u6;14
MONGSTRADAMUS;"The only issue I think that could arise is if you are trying to do a 3 fund portfolio, I think with schwab you may have to expand that to a 4 fund because of the way they handle international. I think SCHF doesn't have emerging markets so you may need to add that seperately as well as international small caps, as opposed to VXUS with vanguard that covers both of those asset classes. Thats a very minor exception in terms of differences when it comes to their etfs. 

On a side note I think in general ishares, vanguard, and schwab fees on etfs are so low it doesn't really matter that much. ";1514999197;ds4uye3;t3_7nv8u6;7
ChekovsWorm;"&gt; the cost of most Schwab ETFs are cheaper than vanguard's so you'll be getting more of them for the price.

Suggest, especially for a new investor like the OP, that you clarify your terms. I hope, but am not at all sure, that you mean, ""expense ratio is lower"", as in the internal expense ratio including the fund company sponsor's management fee within the ETF. Thus meaning that ""more of each invested dollar actually goes into the underlying investments in the ETF rather than to the ETF management and internal fees.""

I hope you don't mean ""share price"" by ""cost of most Schwab ETFs"" even though that also happens to be mostly true, because share price is 100% irrelevant to anything. Unless you are investing so little that you don't have the price of one whole share.

Rounding to whole shares is still an issue even at a modest multiple of enough for one whole share.

The only requirement for consumer willing to deficit spending is that the consumers are optimistic, they do not need to predict anything. If they are wrong and overspent, they suffer the consequent, of cause.

&gt;For example, the average american household debt owed on a credit card is 15,654.  

This include spending that is paid in full every month. For the 1% who spent 10k per month and more they are smart enough to fully pay it back when billed. For the rest who overspent or take loan due to emergency, they have to pay a lot in interest. Yet even with high default rate, CC loan are extremely profitable.
https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/card-issuer-bank-profit.php

Also even if we assume the $15,654 is not paid back and being charged interest, assuming 20% interest rate on the card, the interest is only about $3000 per year. Not a small amount of cause but certainly serviceable.

So given that the average American earn enough to make CC loan profitable, I am not sure what you are worrying about. 
For those who cannot access low interest rate loan and have to take   CC loan, yes they are milked by the bank but this does not somehow make the economy crash or something.

Right, and this is the main point I've been trying to make. Alone, this looks serviceable and manageable. But that's assuming the consumer doesn't have a lot of other debts they are paying, which unfortunately is not common. When you add CC debts to other debts like the massive amount of student loan debt, car loan debt, mortgage debt, etc, you start to see problems. 

By itself, not a problem. But in aggregate when combined with other debts, it becomes a ton of debt that needs to get paid back, and if that happens, which of their debts do you think consumers will default on first these days?";1515076295;ds6fgy6;t3_7nvlt0;2

Debt service ratios have been pinned at historic lows for nearly 5 years now. Yes, they will begin to rise as interest rates do, but there is quite a ways to go before it becomes some kind of threat as you seem to imply.

ChekovsWorm;"With only $1000 and Vanguard's customer-unfriendly $3000 minimum per mutual fund (except $1000 for all-in-one target date funds), you have only two choices:

1. Buy a full $1000 of an appropriate-for-you target date mutual fund.

2. Buy one or a few, whole-shares-only (not dollar amounts) of Vanguard ETFs that match, more or less, what you or people and free guidance you trust (including Vanguard but not only them) suggest for a proper asset class allocation would be for your age, goals, risk profile.

Hint: It is almost never, ""Everything in the S&amp;P500 ETF"" nor ""Everything in the US Total Stock Market"" nor ""Everything in stocks"" no matter what your age. Even though it often is in this sub.

Very easy to learn about asset allocation. I am not a professional of any sort in the investing field. However at any age I would, as a slightly informed, maybe clueless, layperson / internet blowhard, suggest that everyone have at least some investment in each of these asset classes:

US Domestic Stock, beyond just the largest 500

Foreign Developed Market Stock (at least large cap)

Emerging Market Stock

US Domestic total bond market (at least all of the investment-grade market)

Foreign bonds total market (at least again all of the investment grade.)

There are ""index fund"" mutual funds for each one of those, including $3000 per fund (so useless to you without well over $12,000 for a proper allocation at Vanguard, though trivially easy at Schwab), and index fund Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) for the same, at Vanguard. Other than the ""can't do exact percentage allocation I want due to whole-shares-only"", you could come pretty close to a sensible start on a good allocation, a few different ways using Vanguard ETFs.

You might want 80% stocks, 20% fixed income. Maybe even 90/10, which is considered Aggressive Growth. Or you may want 70/30, 60/40 (a classic split but maybe conservative for a younger redditor). Even if you are nearing retirement you might want 50/50 or 40/50, and even if you are 18 you might well be advised to have at least 5-10% in fixed income rather than 100% stock. 

You can't get exactly any of that at Vanguard with $1000, but consider VTI for total US stocks and VEA for developed world stocks. Or consider your entire stock allocation in VT total world stocks, US, foreign, large, small, developed world, emerging market, all in one ETF based upon overall market capitalization. If you want to have some control over US-vs-Foreign, consider if your desired percentages, total to invest, and the current share prices, allow a split between VTI and VXUS. For fixed income, maybe a share of BND? If your total, desired %, and the share prices allow, maybe add a share of BNDX for non-US fixed income (bonds). 

Look how much I am NOT suggesting VOO, the S&amp;P500 largest-500-only, US-only, ETF as your stock allocation. 

Do keep in mind the proper terminology, so as to keep the proper mindset and understanding. The question should not be, ""Where do I put my contribution? - you already answered that in your actions - ""In a Vanguard brokerage account IRA"". The actual question you are asking is ""What securities should I invest in, in my brokerage IRA at Vanguard?"" May seem trivial, but this sub is full of people who confused ""IRA"" with ""buying things in the IRA"" and then are very disappointed. 

If you're not interested in doing/learning about asset class allocation, then definitely just plop the $1000 and each monthly addition into the age-appropriate target date allocation mutual fund. That is by no means a bad thing, and it will save you from the ""put everything in an 'index fund' mentality with all the pressure of people equating 'index fund' only with the S&amp;P500 Index, a very limited subset of the overall investing world.

You will still be ""indexing"", just with Vanguard doing a smart asset allocation for you. Cruise control, automatic transmission and very soft-feel power steering instead of a 6-speed manual, lightly assisted good road feel, and you deciding which gear to be in and what the engine RPM is.

I love S1's like this

&gt;On January 21, 2015, the Company received an unsecured loan in the amount of $1,300, due on demand from Wendy Seabre, bearing interest at 10% per annum. Repaid on June 15, 2017. The largest aggregate amount outstanding was $1,300 during the periods ended June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Mrs. Seabre is the wife of Mr. Roger Seabre, who owns approximately 2% of our common stock and has been a significant investor recently.

Kinda like Buffett and his Goldman deal

Global expansion:

&gt;We have also formed WEED Australia Ltd., registered as an unlisted public company in Australia, to address future global demand, however the entity has been dormant since its inception.

Always great to get ahead of things. 

One that everyone knows, but reads funny in an S1:

&gt;
Cannabis is a schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized, its production and use remains a violation of federal law. Since federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis preempts state laws that legalize its use, strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in our inability to proceed with our business plan.

One of the investors:

&gt;Water of Life Metropolation Community is controlled by Rev. James Burns.

Now you have to be fucking with me. A catholic priest called Burns invests in weed through his church. So I looked up the dude:

&gt;In his private practice he treats individuals and couples with mood and anxiety disorders along with a focus on ministry personnel, especially priests.

You fucking bet he does!

theoriginaldandan;My question is if I say put all my dividends away in a savings account, will they cover my taxes at the end of the year ;1515003235;ds4ywtk;t3_7nweyg;1
jsf67;"USA answer: (your question is odd enough that it is worth pointing out the tax law is very different in some other countries).  

If you hold dividend stocks (don't sell them) the capital gains (or losses) are not realized, so any tax impact of the capital gains/losses is delayed until you sell.  
  
So while you are holding (not trading) dividend stocks, the only taxable income they generate will be the dividends themselves:  
  
&gt; will the dividends cover my taxes or will I need to pay cash to cover the taxes  
  
Both of those are true.  The tax is under 100% so the dividends will cover the tax on the dividends.  But the dividends go into your brokerage account, or optionally are reinvested.  The taxes are not paid automatically (as they are for earned income).  You need cash (which you could take from that brokerage account if the dividends wreen't reinvested) to pay the tax.";1515003516;ds4z6ff;t3_7nweyg;2
SirGlass;"Well it will cover your taxes on the dividends ; 

Dividends either qualified or non-qualified so taxed at a long term rate (usually 15%) for qualified and for non-qualified taxed at your normal tax rate what top will be 37%.

There is no tax rate that is over 100%

jsf67;"&gt; as long as it pays dividends?  
  
Whether it pays dividends makes no difference.  You don't pay tax on gains in a stock price until you sell.  
  
That is the reason, if total yield were the same, growth stocks are better for taxable accounts than dividend stocks.  You could hold the opinion that growth stocks are higher risk and prefer dividend stocks despite the relative tax inefficiency.  So it is an opinion (rather than a clear fact) that dividend stocks are a worse choice in a taxable account.  But in my opinion, dividend stocks are worse.";1515024498;ds5jr8m;t3_7nweyg;3

Lastly, yes it is a major concern that passive management is distoring the valuations in the market. If we lived in a world that was 100% passive managed, what would be a triggering event for a firm that's already inclusive of the index to be removed? Because it takes someone actively managing to make the decision to sell. If no one is making any decisions, it arbitrarily props up the market. That's *logic*

&gt;In December 1986, Vanguard launched its second mutual fund, a bond index fund called the Total Bond Fund, which was the first bond index fund ever offered to individual investors.[23] One earlier criticism of the First Index fund was that it was only an index of the S&amp;P 500.[7][8] In December 1987, Vanguard launched its third fund, the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund,

&gt;So which ""active"" funds are you referring to?

Again, Vanguard sold the Wellington, Morgan Growth, Windsor, Wellesley, etc funds since Vanguard started. As I said, PRIMECAP came out before the Bond Index fund. They also had long-term investment grade (originally called Westminster Bond fund) among others. It was an active shop by AUM and number of products up until the late 90s when indexing took off.

made a motion that formalized my earlier proposal that

driven no-load system operating under Vanguard’s aegis. 
My claim (again accurate, if perhaps disingenuous) was 
that we were not violating our pledge that precluded 
Vanguard from engaging in distribution, but were 
simply eliminating distribution. The vote was close, but 
the proposal was approved. That step completed our

As many pointed out already, people in their late teens / early 20's do not have much to invest when compared to other retail investors.  On top of that, retail investors make a small percentage of the money in the markets. Someone born in 1999 that is in college *might* be able to afford $50 / paycheck.

&gt; During Q4, we made major progress addressing Model 3 production bottlenecks, with our production rate increasing significantly towards the end of the quarter. In the last seven working days of the quarter, we made 793 Model 3's, and in the last few days, we hit a production rate on each of our manufacturing lines that extrapolates to over 1,000 Model 3's per week. As a result of the significant growth in our production rate, we made as many Model 3's since December 9th as we did in the more than four months of Model 3 production up to that point. This is why we were not able to deliver many of these cars during the holiday season, just before the quarter ended. Model 3 deliveries to non-employee customers are now accelerating rapidly, and we're confident our customers will love them.

As someone who's been long TSLA forever I'm (still) pretty happy. After hours traders, not so much.

&gt; We intend to achieve the 5,000 per week milestone by the end of Q2.

In other words, they're six months behind their own guess. Not great, but as long as there are no fundamental barriers I don't see this as a big deal. (Remember the Model X ramp?)

Very little likelihood that Tesla works through the optioned M3 before they get to the base $35k M3 and the federal tax credit is intact.

So Model 3 production should be at least 12,000 units in 2018-Q1 but could be significantly higher than that depending on how quickly production ramps. If the ramp is linear then Model 3 production could be expected to hit around 21,000 units in 2018-Q1, but I expect it won’t be linear and final production will be closer to the 15,000-17,000 units range.";1515017872;ds5dslt;t3_7nxwj3;0

wanmoar;"Do you understand how business works at all? 

If you did you'd know that the manufacturers allow for those profits because doing it themselves is more expensive. The dealership model makes cars cheaper. 

dealer margins are puny. On the order of 1% or 2%. Those margins do not come from customers. Margins are driven largely by the manufacturers' volume driven bonus plans which means the dealer will drop prices to meet volume goals because whatever they make on a car is nothing compared to the Volume bonus they can get on meeting that target

trevcam11;"The average consumer will always pay more in a no-haggle model. I guess I just don't understand the logic of consciously paying more for the peace of mind of knowing you didn't pay more than anyone else, rather than paying less but potentially still paying more than someone else did elsewhere. It's completely fine if that's your personal preference, but that doesn't mean the ""model"" is any better. 

The ""model"" only works because people trust what Tesla says all their cars are worth and are willing to pay it. If Chrysler did the same, people would say ""no way"". The people drive the current auto market model, not the industry. If all consumers came together and said ""we want online, no haggle, transparent pricing and as long as we get that, we will pay whatever you say your new and used cars are worth"", the automakers would go from six to midnight in a heartbeat.

I'd consider myself a value investor at the core because that's how I learned, and I focus on the buy and hold mentality but that's gradually changed recently as I found more financial stability, my retirement is through a 401k at work so my personal investing has taken a more salacious turn. My current portfolio consists of a small foundation of super conservative holdings (KO and PG style holdings) which serve to insulate me from the rest, as especially recently I've picked up quite a few high-risk holdings as my personal philosophy has changed.

A lot of these private equity investments are put into things like ""General Capital Partners Opportunity Fund IX"" and the money sits there for at least a decade through a lockup clause. 

The pension fund also likes to find private equity firms to invest with rather than the other way around. Pension board staff will sometimes cold-call PE firms they see or hear about doing really well to see if there are opportunities to invest. The CIO prefers to offer the money to invest rather than being offered the opportunity to do so. Weeds out a lot of bad actors just looking for cash injections into their fund, he says.

programmingguy;"Similar situation... Paid of wife's student loans. Have 15 yr mortgage @ 3%. Keeping an emergency fund, I went all stocks and will be going all stocks as long as I can... 


1. Essentially oppertunity cost of paying down fixed debt which will lose to inflation. 1$ in interest payments today is worth less 15 years down the line. I$ in a stock is worth a lot more 15 years down the line. 

2. I don't see my house as an investment asset. Will be here for atleast 5 more years. So I don't see the point of building equity beyond what I already do with regular mortgage payments.

3. 3% over 15 years wasn't a lot compared to how much I could make with stocks and dividends over that time period. 

4. I already make around 10% and growing of the total mortgage interest annually from dividend payments and stocks have appreciated significantly. 10k invested in MCD 5 years ago would be worth some ~20000 now with a Yield on Cost of some  5% with some annual payments of $500 (accounting for dividend growth).... If I had instead put that 10000 in paying of a 3% loan, I would have lost that oppertunity and instead would have saved some $1650 in interest payments. So it's a no brainer for me.


All this assumes that you can make the monthly mortgage payment even if you go through a two or three bear markets. ";1515046372;ds60qsz;t3_7o01f1;1
big_deal;"Usually (over a long term average) you'll earn more in the market. But the market is more volatile so it's not guaranteed that over a specific time period you come out ahead. 

For me there are two considerations: 1) are you investing at least 10-15% of your income so you have enough to retire, 2) what kind of overall asset allocation do you want?

For me, 10-15% for retirement has to come first. I wouldn't reduce retirement saving lower than this to pay off a mortgage. The only exception to this is if you had the ability to completely pay off the mortgage in a very short period (1-2 years). 

In deciding what to do with income beyond this 10-15% I just treat my home equity as a portion of my asset allocation. Home prices are more stable than stocks and the mortgage is a known interest rate - it's sort of like a short to intermediate term bond holding. How much of your wealth do you want in such an asset? If the answer is 'none - all equities for me' then max out the investment account and make normal mortgage payments. If you're more conservative and don't want all your wealth in equities, then allocate between investments and home equity in the proportion that results in your desired asset allocation. 

I did exactly what I describe above to payoff my mortgage. Paid extra on the mortgage because I didn't want to put everything into stocks. (Just to be clear my investment accounts actually were 100% stocks but my overall assets were balance between stocks, cash, and home equity). Initially we didn't have too much extra to pay so it took about 12 years before we were within ~2 years of paying off. At that point we cut our budget to the bare minimum and quickly paid off the mortgage. Then we adjusted our budget and ramped up our retirement/investment contributions significantly.

ron_leflore;Those rates are annualized.  You won't get $12.70 for a $1000 4 week t Bill.;1515042823;ds5yje4;t3_7o0lg3;9
fakerfakefakerson;"&gt; So for example if I bought a 4 WK T-Bill for $1000 and earned $12.70 from it after 4 weeks, then used that total to immediately buy another 4 WK, and then use all of that to buy another, I would end up with $1038.58 after 12 weeks. But if I bought a 13 WK T-Bill with my $1000, I would end up with $1014.20 after 13 weeks.


You’re misinterpreting the meaning of the Bank Yield rate. The 1.27 isn’t what you’re getting off each transaction, it’s annualized (ignoring compounding). Instead of 12.70 from each one, you’d only actually make about $1.06, and about $3.21 from rolling it twice (including compounding).  Compare that to the $3.58 you’ll make from the 13 week and now you see how the term premium (what little still exists) comes into play. ";1515043595;ds5z1hf;t3_7o0lg3;3

For a 4 WK bill, it says I can buy a $100 bill for $99.90, giving me a discount of $0.10. To pump up those numbers, if I buy $1,000 worth of bills then I can earn $1.00 in 4 Wks. For a 13 WK bill, I can spent $997.14 to buy $1000 worth of 13 WK bills which earns me $2.86 from the discounts. But if I bought three 4 WK bills in a row, I'd have $3.00 which is more than I'd get from the 13 WK bill.";1515091971;ds6ui8c;t3_7o0lg3;2

zachmoe;"&gt; where you give your money for a certain amount of years for a certain amount if interest each year, and your money back guaranteed. 

Sounds like government bonds.  

But right investing is about making a portfolio.  But first you need a bank account to move money ACH into all these different brokerage accounts.

Bonds should be a part of a diversified portfolio, certainly don't hurt.  You'll need your parents help setting up accounts being that you're a minor.  You can't buy bonds at a bank anymore, but You can buy bonds from the government www.treasurydirect.gov or you can get a brokerage and buy an ETF that has bonds (there are different types like junk, corporate, municipal, or government) either tdameritrade or schwab or robinhood whatever.

Stocks you'll need a brokerage account again, you can find stocks you might have an interest in www.finviz.com  General advice is find an ETF that tracks the S&amp;P500.

Cryptocurrency is a hot topic you can get those from www.gdax.com ETH seems to be the only one that's alive still but that's a very wonky space.

Forex is also interesting you can trade currency pairs with leverage with www.oanda.com

Precious metals are sexy and coin collecting is fun and you can get those from www.apmex.com or www.jmbullion.com or again there are ETFs you can buy and hold in a brokerage account but those are not as sexy or fun to look at but much easier to capitalize on price movements.

Creditoring is also a space you could make money www.lendingclub.com it's like those government bonds only you run the risk of not getting paid back at all, but higher interest because of that risk.  Buyer beware lol

But for investing look into topics like the time value of money, and discount cash flow.  Consider watching Martin Shkreli's youtube videos about finance.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARrNYyJEnFI

As far as reading goes, read everything and everything and keep your ears to the ground and your cash ready for an opportunity.

But really, the only way to actually invest and have it be fun and rewarding is to have income, the only investing worth investing is reinvesting, so start working kid.  Get a good education don't sell yourself short, make attainable increasingly positive financial goals.  Don't do drugs.  But really, just buy as much brk.b as you can for the next 5 years, beg borrow or steal, get those shares kid, you can do it.";1515053204;ds6474s;t3_7o1gjp;2

zachmoe;"Wouldn't your cost per share go DOWN upon the selling at $30...?  And then only slightly up upon rebuying?

So we got 2500 shares that cost 25k initial investment that turns into 75k... sell 30k... now we got 1500 shares worth 45k that cost -5k....?  Then we increase our cost 31k... so that's 2500 shares that cost 26k... so that's like $10.40 average... (which is not bad if it is still at $31 great margin of safety)?

Because just as buying at a higher price would raise your average cost per share, selling lowers it.  Just as buying at a lower price would lower your average cost per share and selling at a lower price would raise your average cost per share.

If you had the 2500 shares at $10 and you bought 2500 more shares at $30 you would expect your average to be exactly between 10 and 30.";1515068497;ds6alkz;t3_7o1tb9;0

Yeah we only started with 25k, we sold 30k that's how I came up with -5k.  -3.33 average cost per share (don't think it really calculates like that), the 1500 shares left were 'free' at that point.

Amarsir;"It's just math for averages.

2500 * 10 = 25,000 spent on 2500 shares.  
*then you sell some*  
1500 * 10 = 15,000 spent on 1500 shares.  
*then you buy back*  
1500 * 10 + 1000 * 31 = 46,000 spent on 2500 shares.  
**for a total of $18.40 cost basis per share.**

It doesn't matter what you sold for, because cost is not about total gains and losses. It's literally just about what you paid for what you have now. So after your sell and repurchase, you have a cost basis of $18.40 and additionally have a profit of $20,000.

If you think about the tax implications, the separation becomes clearer. You're going to have to pay tax on that $20,000 and the fact that you repurchased them a dollar higher won't avoid it. That's a separate transaction which will be part of your cost basis for your *next* sale.";1515076159;ds6fd7a;t3_7o1tb9;3
Yellowbucklesareblue;"Ok, I'm sort of getting it. The real world numbers are:

Bought 2615 @ $12.286  
Sold 945 @ $34.045  
Bought 1092 @ $32.30

When I do the math the way you've explained it comes to an avg of $20.19.

I guess where I get messed up is that the P/L remains just as high (or in this case higher) than without selling and rebuying, but when you calculate it based on the new numbers, it's significantly less than before selling and rebuying. Get where I'm coming from?

**EDIT:** So in my head, in the end, it works more like:

*bought*  
2615 * 12.286 = 32,127.89  
*bought more with profits &amp; some extra cash*  
147 * 32.30 = 4748.1

Amarsir;"Sure. You're trying to judge how successful your trades have been. It's not an unreasonable line of thought. It just wouldn't be properly called ""cost basis"". Profit &amp; loss is a fair term for it, but be careful about mixing actual profit already taken with theoretical profit based on market price.

The other thing I'd like to caution you though is that when you're judging where a stock position is going, try not to be affected by where it came from. Your decision on every stock you hold should be exactly the same as if you just bought it new every day. (Possibly excluding certain tax concerns.) If the story changes on a stock, either because there's new news or the price has run way up, don't keep it just because you already have it if it's not something you actively want.";1515162911;ds86m53;t3_7o1tb9;2

Amarsir;"&gt;Fair enough, how can I avoid mixing these up?

I would do it by treating the new, high cost basis as the real one. And pretending that the profit you made was from a completely separate stock. Over your investment career you'll have lots of good trades and probably a few bad ones. And you can totally look back on your wins and think ""that was smart, so what can I look for in the future to find new opportunities like that."" But trying to talk yourself in to a lower cost basis as if it never changed would only be blocking yourself from that lesson.";1515169111;ds8c5r1;t3_7o1tb9;2

ServerOfJustice;"So you can google those terms if you'd like more specific definitions but here's the gist.

With spread and NAV I'm saying you could overpay relative to the actual value with an ETF, not a concern with MFs.

MFs allow you to dump any amount of money you want into a fund because they allow partial shares of any amount. Want to put $500 into VTWSX? No problem. ETFs are bought as full shares. Want to put $500 into VT? Current price as of this post is $75.85 - you can buy 6 shares for $455.10 with $44.90 left over uninvested.

Are these problems of consequence? Maybe, probably not. Same deal with the difference in expense ratio. My guess is ETF vs mutual fund will have little difference in the end and you should choose the one you like best.";1515160725;ds854fc;t3_7o2k5k;1

05cavalier;"Congrats on taking this first step!

I believe you are on the right path but have terms a little confused. Index funds, mutual funds, and etfs are types of investments whereas the Roth IRA is just an account type to hold all your investments. You can, and tons of people do, put index funds, mutual funds, and etfs in your Roth IRA.

The Roth IRA itself does not return you any money. ";1515074139;ds6dv6p;t3_7o32on;4
Dfsilva;"Thanks a lot for your clarification :) . So what is tax free part that I see being mentioned about the Roth IRA?
";1515074747;ds6eaps;t3_7o32on;1
OSUBedbugs;There are two types of investment accounts. Ones that are pre-tax (this is a 401K, traditional IRA, 403B...), or post-tax (Roth IRA, Roth 401K/403B). In pre-tax accounts you can make the contributed amount of your income tax deferred. So, lets say you make 50K a year, but put 10K into your 401K. This means you would only claim 40K on your tax return, and would pay taxes when the money is withdrawn. If you used a Roth you would claim all 50K, but you would owe no taxes if it is withdrawn according to the rules. ;1515075303;ds6ep9p;t3_7o32on;2
05cavalier;With a Roth IRA you pay no capital gains taxes when you are old enough to take distributions. You cannot claim contributions as deductions on your taxes though like you can with other types of accounts.;1515081179;ds6jpef;t3_7o32on;3
jackster1232002;"&gt;  with other types of accounts

With other types of **retirement** accounts. I know what you mean but just so OP doesn't try to write off contributions to a brokerage account. ";1515084396;ds6mvgy;t3_7o32on;3
GaylrdFocker;"&gt;why not put all your money in a retirement fund such as the Roth IRA

Because there is a limit to how much you can put into an IRA. For 2018 it is $5500.  Many people have more than that to invest so they invest additional money in taxable accounts.";1515095837;ds6y7qg;t3_7o32on;1
Just-Touch-It;The answer is a Traditional IRA account, OP in case you’re wondering.;1515111034;ds7afdh;t3_7o32on;1
Just-Touch-It;"Well said, pay attention to this OP. The ROTH IRA is nothing more than an account where you keep your investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. Don’t simply put money into the ROTH IRA and let it sit there or else you’ll earn basically nothing. You want to put the money sitting in your IRA account into actual investment vehicles like stocks, funds, ETFs, bonds, etc. 

That’s not to minimize or dismiss how advantageous an ROTH IRA is however. The advantages of having a ROTH IRA are that you have your taxes deducted normally out of your work pay check like always and then put that money in your IRA account. And that’s it, no more taxes on that money which means no taxes on dividends or any returns from the money the HOLDINGS inside your ROTH IRA account make/earn. Money invested in normal brokerage accounts are taxed going in and then again after any future income is earned off it through selling your holdings, dividends, or other returns. A ROTH IRA is basically only taxed once instead of several times.

Think of it like a cookie jar filled with cookies. The ROTH IRA account is the cookie jar. It’s a nice jar but you can’t actually eat the jar or enjoy it. What’s important is what’s inside the jar: the cookies. The cookies are your stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Now imagine that this cookie jar is a special type of jar that’s different from all the other cookie jars at the store. This special type of cookie jar allows any cookies in it to be totally calorie free (tax advantaged) so you won’t gain any weight or have any health issues eating them. The catch is that the jar is fairly small so you can only put so many cookies into it every year (the max annual amount you can contribute for an IRA is $5,500 per year for an individual under age 50).";1515111979;ds7b9oi;t3_7o32on;1
Dfsilva;So, if I understand you correctly, with the pre tax accounts, whatever money you put in, you don’t pay tax for it on your yearly tax declaration, but if you want to withdraw, you pay taxes. With the post tax accounts, the money that you put in there is not tax exempt, but if you withdraw after meeting some conditions, you won’t pay taxes on the capital gains that you got over time. So which is the better option?;1515158640;ds83rdw;t3_7o32on;1
Dfsilva;Thanks for this ;1515158772;ds83u8o;t3_7o32on;2
Dfsilva;This makes it clearer, thank you ;1515158796;ds83usu;t3_7o32on;2
OSUBedbugs;"The better option depends on your circumstances. If you are young and have a relatively low income tax rate, then I would suggest the Roth account. If you are older, and/or if you make a good annual salary, then you would benefit more from putting money into tax-deferment in order to lower your taxable income rate. However, you can have both. I have a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. I also have a 401K and Roth 401K. This way, I have all options on the table. BTW these are retirement accounts. You are not supposed to take money out of them until you retire. If you do, you will most likely be penalized in some way. As with all things do your research. 
Here is a little tool from Charles Schwab that allows you to compare Traditional and Roth IRA's. FYI, Charles Schwab is a fine choice if you are looking for a place to start your IRA.

Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), was a United States Supreme Court decision that dramatically increased the regulatory power of the federal government. It remains as one of the most important and far-reaching cases concerning the New Deal, and set a precedent for an expansive reading of the United States Constitution's Commerce Clause for decades to come. The goal of the business interests that financed the legal challenge all the way to the Supreme Court was to convince the court to declare the entire federal crop support program unconstitutional and thereby end it.

Amori_A_Splooge;"&gt;I'd fully expect him to toe the party line until proven otherwise.

There isn't really a party line on marijuana issues though. AG Sessions was on the extreme in the Republican party regarding marijuana use, but many, especially in states with it legalized are in favor of loosening constraints; especially with issues like hemp cultivation, medical marijuana (laws were passed last congress that loosened restrictions for veterans seeking help at VA facilities). Marijuana has come a long way in the last 10 years. Pres. Obama was against it when he was running for President as were most other nominees for the 2008 and 2012 cycle (with the exception of Ron Paul, who was a Republican).

 &gt;Has he actually done that though?

[Senate hold procedures are weird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_hold). Sometimes they are anonymous and sometimes they are public. If they are anonymous the only thing people will notice is that their nominees aren't coming to a confirmation vote on the floor until the hold is rescinded. ";1515100535;ds71w5c;t3_7o3j8f;1
Amori_A_Splooge;"&gt;We have well over 50% of Americans who support legalization, and we do not have 50% of Congress supporting it.

This is a useless statistic. Congress doesn't give two shits about what 50% of Americans want. There is only one elected official who is elected by the entirety of the United States and that is the President. Congress only cares about what their constituents think.  A member from Nebraska doesn't care if the 60 million people in NY and CA voted to legalize marijuana. He only cares about the people of Nebraska, if they are against it, chances are he/she won't change their position. 

But if you look at members from states that have recently legalized marijuana use, members from those states have adopted less restrictive positions when the few times they have been brought to the floor for a vote or if the federal government tries to impose on state-sanctioned activities. 

The more states that legalize marijuana, the more members of congress are going to support these initiatives when they come up.  ";1515101251;ds72c07;t3_7o3j8f;-2

This is a very naive, idealistic view of how Congress works.

Congresspeople can go against their constituencies on specific issues because they also serve the greater needs of their party or their country. They can (and do) go against their constituencies any time they want, as long as they think they won't get punished at the polls for it. The tax reform bill is a great example of this, with high-income-tax/property value states getting screwed over on SALT deductions (among many other issues). Those were, with very few exceptions, party-line votes. Virtually every Republican from those states (NY, NJ, CA, etc.) voted against their constituency's interests.";1515105785;ds75w6m;t3_7o3j8f;3

Amori_A_Splooge;"Your initial point was that Sessions enforcing federal law will only motivate the majority of Americans of to change the law, but not members of Congress. 

I pointed out that members of congress in states that have legalized marijuana use are more prone to protect their state's rights if the federal government tries to supersede them. Look at the articles regarding this announcement: http://wapo.st/2CSpV5M; http://bit.ly/2ESDYsG; http://nyti.ms/2qsg2ZW

Who are the Members of Congress that are quoted; Sen. Gardner of Colorado and Sen. Murkowski from Alaska. As more and more states legalize marijuana more Members of Congress will work to protect their districts interest. But the notion that because 50% of Americans support something that 50% of Congress supports it is naive and incorrect. ";1515116153;ds7f15x;t3_7o3j8f;1
Amori_A_Splooge;"True but my point was more-so trying to highlight that Members of Congress don't care what 50% of Americans care about something, they care about what their constituents think. That's why if you try to call a Members office, they'll ask you where you are from and if you don't give a zip code from their district they will either transfer you, ask you to call your member of congress, or listen kindly but then still tell you to call your member of congress. 

But regarding the tax bill, members from those states also threatened not to vote for the bill until they got SALT deductions up to $10,000 restored to the bill. In CA you would have to have a household income of [$140,000 in order to hit that cap.](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes) But with such a large package like the tax bill, you could easily try to sell that the benefits outweigh the negatives if you have a decent comms person.

Are you just being intellectually dishonest or can't think? Republicans' stance on state rights means limiting federal laws as much as possible and letting states decide on the majority of policies... in order to do that these policies can't already be regulated federal law so the whole definition of states' rights is to limit federal laws.

DMW206;"First, you have to determine if a line should be drawn at all. Are we free entirely, partially, or not at all?

Then, if you determine a line should be drawn, you have to think about how to approach the issue. People are going to do drugs and drink. They are. So, do we crack down on them for doing so? By cracking down we are hoping to deter people from doing these things, mainly through fear. Is fear a good motivator? In my experience (was an USAF cop once upon a time), no. People just find more creative ways to get around the system. And they more generally become discontent with the society they live in. This furthers their likelihood of not giving a shit about the society that doesn't give a shit about what they give a shit about. They stop caring, and when you don't care, you fear very little. And it makes people feel like you're out to get them. And, really, you are. Because they are not just afraid of the consequences of doing something while high. They are afraid to make a personal decision in the first place.
 
The better answer is either rehabilitation services once you are caught, instead of jail time, if that is necessary. A prison cell is not the answer, believe me. Or, honestly, just make the shit available and legal. I believe in freedom of choice. You make the decision to show up to work high, you get caught by an employer who cares, then yeah, you have to deal with those consequences. You get high and drive - debatable, but yeah, maybe you get in trouble for it. Getting in trouble for choosing to do something in the safety of your own home is ridiculous. I've always believed that. I may or may not have allegedly not busted people in the service for doing this. Just saying. 

That said now, it is also important to remember what kind of drug we're talking about. Look at the evidence. Marijuana is not Meth, let's say, as a comparison. Not even close. Pot can be habitual. But McDonalds can become habitual. I have never heard of or had a case where someone broke into a person's car to steal all their shit to fuel a weed habit, and if a case like that exists, I can't imagine the number of cases is astronomical. And you'd be surprised at how much society polices itself. Even if we went so far as to make Meth legal, no one could really do meth and survive in our society. No one wants to go to the dentist and see a receptionist with meth-teeth smiling at them. I'm about to go to Optometry School. Do you think I'd want a receptionist who is stoned as shit when I run my own clinic that centers around the eyes? LOL. No. (But I wouldn't fire them for doing it in their own home, on the other hand.)

Mini-rant: Plus, why are we having government, much less lawyers and police officers, decide what is and isn't good for our bodies? Do you really think the GOP listens to doctors who know what their talking about? Hell no. They listen to the doctors and employers and pastors who tell them what they want to hear. And they hear 'mind altering substance' and 'decreased efficiency at work' and 'it's a sin'. Those are two cardinal sins - being other than what God created you as inside your skull at any time, and a potential decrease in profitability due to a workforce that is stoned. I believe the worry boils down to religion and money. Safety is an excuse for fools - no politician truly cares about our safety, just that we are safe enough to vote for them. But luckily, taxes will bring in a lot of money, and if there is one thing politicians love just as much as, if not more, than Jesus, it's money. Seriously.

The only real argument they have is that it's a ""Dangerous schedule 1 drug like Heroin and Crack and Meth"" and that's a stupid as fuck argument that will fall apart very quickly with the boatloads of positive medical evidence and obvious crime and harm reduction these states are seeing.

NoReallyFuckReddit;"&gt; Is it time to buy?

No.  ...and here's why:

Currently almost every US pot stock (head over to /r/weedstocks and /r/TheCannalysts and search for the keyword ""spreadsheet"") is listed on the OTCMKTS.  Pink sheets.  Penny stocks (although you have to be careful because some people use ""penny stock"" to indicate microcaps listed on a regulated exchange).

OTCMKTS is where frauds and failures live.   When a company gets delisted from a regulated exchange this is where they end up.  When someone wants to start a company for the express purpose of defrauding investors, this is where they are started.

A little example:  Apple wanted to engage a company called Liquid Metal that had fallen off of the NASDAQ exchange about a decade ago.  Rather than face the prospect of buying the company for 100x what it was worth, they drafted a $20 million dollar agreement that LQMT would never make consumer electronic products for anyone but Apple.  That's how toxic the OTCMKTS is.  The world's richest company could not bring themselves to buy a company listed on the OTCMKTS.

Need another example?  Ok... FNMA.  A failed GSE that the government decided to wind down after the sub-prime crisis caused the government to be responsible for the ""Full Faith and Credit of the United State of America"" guarantee to FNMA mortgage balance sheet.  Never again, the US government said and banished FNMA off to the OTCMKTS so that it could be wound down, allowing its mortgage portfolio to be sold off.

Here's the problem with US pot stocks:  intrinsic value of a stock company listed on a regulated exchange is determined by balance sheet lodgings with SEC (under penalty of law for fraud); OTCMKTS stock companies are not held to this standard.  Furthermore, because pot stock companies can't use the banking system (for fear of the Feds doing civil asset forfeiture on their account), the ability to even generate a statement to lodge with the SEC is an impossibility.... and not that it would matter anyway, because, as a OTCMKTS stock company, they could just make shit up.

Two critical things need to happen before US pot stock companies are suitable for investment or even speculation:

1)  The Feds need to be neutered with respect to civil asset forfeiture (not going to happen any time soon, as significant Federal powers are derived from this function).

2)  OTCMKTS companies that are ""legitimate"" need to have a pathway developed that allows them to migrate back on to a regulated exchange.  Right now OTCKMTS is a roach motel.  The fraudulent nature of the OTCMKTS reinforces the legitimacy of regulated exchanges (sort of like how India couldn't exist without the caste system).

So, generally speaking, my advice is to stick to Canadian stocks listed on regulated exchanges using a tick-box list of cross-checks that verify their operations are legitimate.  Maybe, we'll see some of the Canadian companies buy US pot stock companies and provide civil asset forfeiture immunity via Canada's rule of law... but I highly doubt that Canadian pot companies will mess around in the OTCMKTS where most of the US companies are listed. ";1515189138;ds8wmc1;t3_7o482h;2
shenanigins;Yes, but that's not what is going on. If there was no federal law than no one would care and your statement would be relevant, but that's not the case.

That is going to encourage people and business to leave which will reduce tax revenues. These types of states really needed the MJ tax revenue to offset the damage. 

There may be an element of the administration here saying “don’t think you’re going to get around the consequences of being such a high tax and spend state by generating MJ tax revenue”.
