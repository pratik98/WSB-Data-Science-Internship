sneakersbythesea_;1515906948;7qa0gr;;4;;3;"Hi guys I need some help, so I started working last year and using the advice of my seniors and friends I opened a DEMAT account to start investing in mutual fund SIPs.

My salary account being HDFC, I opened a DEMAT account through them. Initially I was very apprehensive about transaction charges, annual fee etc etc but I was told that as long as there would be 15 transactions per year this would be free and there would be no additional costs. The HDFC guy specifically told me that since I had three mutual fund SIPs these transactions would get completed within 5 months so I don't have to worry and I won't have to pay a thing..other than the one time charge and the transaction deduction (which I think is somewhere around 0.05% or 20rs per transaction whichever is lower).
So everything was going fine, and I'm a meticulous budgeter, until I just realised that HDFC just deducted Rs. 880 in depository Charges. No explanation. No intimation. Nothing.

I usually keep no money in my bank account because I deduct everything for the end of the month. For eg. Sip deduction, bill deduction, loan emi deduction, and withdraw the rest of the money for my day to day needs and expenditures (petrol, groceries, servicing etc)

I was shocked when I randomly checked my account one day prior to my emi deduction and found the amount short as I'm meticulous in calculating my money and withdrawals.

On checking the transaction history I found the depository Charges levied to me. 

So to summarise:
1) I was told that my DEMAT account by all means would be free and there would be no additional charges other than my one time payment at the start and transaction charges if I have 15 transactions per year
2) HDFC didn't intimate me for any deduction for these charges prior to the deduction 
3) HDFC didn't intimate me AFTER deduction of these charges (normally they send a text message after ANY credit or debit in my account and they didn't for this)
4) there is no explanation of the deduction in my transaction history

This is absolutely crazy and I'm furious with them. If I hadn't opened my account randomly on net banking I would have missed my EMI payment and if I was lax with my money (as in not very aware of all my transactions ) I would have missed this deduction altogether.

I googled this issue and there are multiple complaints about this very same thing and no solution for it.  HDFCs attitude towards it seems to be ""well sucks to be you, what are you gonna do about it?""


I just did some more digging and found that there are two types of DEMAT accounts w.r.t. HDFC and the price for the normal account is 750rs plus tax annually. This WAS NOT communicated to me at the time of opening..or pretty much ever communicated to me. 
There is also a BSDA which is the better account to open for a beginner which again was not told to me.

How is this any different from a scam? Is there any legal way I can go about this? Any other advice? How can I convert my current account to BSDA?

reo_sam;1516001287;7qi5kg;;31;;8;"What is PMS and how is it different from a MF? In most simple terms, the investor holds the securities (stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc.) in HIS name in a PMS, while he holds them as units in case of a mutual fund. 

**Types of PMS:**

On the basis of execution:

1.	Discretionary – The portfolio manager selects which securities or stocks to in-vest / sell and executes the trade. 
2.	Non-discretionary – The manager advises on the stocks but can execute only after taking your consent. He cannot advise and execute on his own. So if you are out on a holiday cruise, there would be no trade in your account.
3.	Advisory – The manager just advises. Whether you want to or not, is up to you. If you want, then you will have to do the trade also. 

**Custodian Account:** is a brokerage +/- bank account. This is a necessary step in a PMS, since the securities are held in your name. 

Two types of custodian accounts:
-	Same Custodian – the account with their own brokerage.
-	Independent or third party: The account is held by someone who is NOT influence-able by the PMS provider. Eg, if you want to go for Kotak PMS services, you should opt for a non-kotak brokerage account. 
Why? So that there is no way the manager can influence the brokerage services to do a fraudulent activity. Refer Madoff investment scandal. And [this]( https://wealthengineersllc.com/what-is-an-independent-custodian/) article.

**How to Start:**

You can give either new cash (money) or existing portfolio of stocks, etc. to the PMS for man-agement.

**Taxability:** Since the account is in your name, all the tax liability lies with you. If there is rapid turnover of the stocks, then the short-term capital gains tax will eat a lot into the net-post-tax- return to you. However, the PMS will show the much higher overall portfolio return. So be cautious in interpreting the returns shown by the PMS services.

**Fees:**

1.	Basic Fixed Fee – Can vary from 0 to 2.5% per annum. So whether you make any money or not, the PMS will charge this amount to you on the basis of overall port-folio value. Usually charged quarterly, if it is there.
2.	Hurdle Rate – Above a certain amount (called hurdle), they can ask for the Per-formance Fee. Which is mentioned like 10% of the profits above a hurdle rate of 8% or 20% of profits above hurdle rate of 20%. There can be a single or multiple slabs of the performance fees.  

**Performance History:** 

They would provide you a historical performance data, as to how they have performed over the last few months and years, alongwith data from inception. 

Things to Take Note of-

-	There should be an yearly performance data also, so as to separate one quar-ter/year performance distorting the entire graph. 
-	If there is no bear market phase in the performance data, you should be wary about that. If the portfolio manager has not undergone a bear-market, chances are very less that he will be able to steer nicely in the next one. Downside protection is an important aspect of portfolio management when the corpus is large (with smaller amounts, the upside volatility is more important). 
-	It is important to see if there are other types of strategies available by the same group, and how have they performed. Is it possible that out of 5 types of strategies, you are being pitched the one which has worked out well in the last few years (by luck), and the ones which haven’t fared well have been discarded or not sold to you.

**Investment Thesis:**

How they would deploy your money? There is a lot of jargon, aka Sales-talk, in this area. Un-fortunately, all of that remains opaque since there is literally no way you can be sure whether what they are talking matches with how they are investing or if the underlying investment process is disciplined across market phases. There would be some examples of how this or that investment thesis worked out (by fortune). 

**Communication:**

Monthly/Quarterly/ Annual letter are sent. The lesser the better, IMO. The manager should be more concerned with managing the money rather than trying to explain the Noise every month or quarter. However, noteworthy communication based upon significant deviations may be communicated as and when needed. 

**Things to Take Note of:**

**Skin in the Game:** Has the manager himself put money in the same portfolio? If there is none or they are not forthcoming about it, just forget about the said PMS. It will never be treated in a manner which is prudent. 

**Fee:** A mutual fund charges you a basic fee, without any hurdle rate. This is currently around 0.85-2.0% per annum (only considered Direct plans so as to have a level playing field with PMS) for any amount of money, and with immediate liquidity. When you are opting for a PMS, the minimum ticket size is 25L and there should be a *discount* on that. If you are being charged more for that, without any additional performance or downside protection, you are much better off with an equivalent MF. 

**Closure of New Money:** Any strategy has a maximum amount which can be managed so as to provide excellent results. Beyond that amount, either the diversification has to be increased or the portfolio itself starts to affect the pricing. Most of the decent ‘boutique’ managers understand and follow it and tell the investor also. While the ‘asset gatherer’ managers just keep on piling new investors. If there is no apparent glass ceiling, then be prepared for average outcomes. 

**Average Holding Period time:** If the portfolio turnover is rapid, then it is going to cost you a lot of short-term capital gains and will decrease your overall net-return. 

**Why not to Invest:** The better managers always have some idea about whom they themselves do not want to get money from. Yes, it may look strange, but the good ones do not want to be answerable to people who don't understand investing or do not have the necessary patience. 

* So either they put in an explanation of when their proposed strategy may not work out (this is beside the standard disclaimer that Past performance does not guarantee future performance) in the future. 
* Or they have a way of whetting the prospective investor with their own questionnaire and then they reject the investor if he is not knowledgeable enough (according to them) or does not have the mental mindset to work with the Manager. Examples for this type would be - if the investor only wants large-cap / bluechip companies in the portfolio, while the manager has expertise in mid and smaller cap areas OR the manager believes in international diversification while the investor does not, etc.). 

* OTOH, the asset gatherer PMS do not shut their doors to anyone, which is a big no-no from my side (a MF is better suitable for this).

svmk1987;1517434191;7udfov;;10;;2;"Background info: I just moved out of India in this financial year. I still have my regular bank account in India which I can access using online net banking, and I am still in the process of opening a separate NRE and NRO account. I worked in India for 3 months this financial year. I moved in end of July, so I have been in India for less than 180 days this financial year, so I won't be considered an Indian resident for this year. 

My problems:

1. I have invested in ELSS funds for tax savings ever since I started working. How do I withdraw from these funds now that I have to technically close my resident account and operate non resident accounts? How does this work? I was thinking of withdrawing some money from these funds and re-investing it into ELSS before this financial year is over to save on some tax.. I don't have much liquid cash left in my Indian bank account for this purpose. (Worst comes to worst, I will send some money from my local bank account for this purpose). 

2. I will be owed back a fairly large sum as income tax return in the following year (because my previous employer calculated and deducted TDS with my full annual salary in mind, but I ended up getting paid only 3 months salary for this entire financial year). How would I get this IT return back? Can I just specify an NRO account while filing IT returns as recipient of IT refund?  

Anyone here any experience in these matters after moving from India? I am quite confused on how to go about these things, and I am slowly running out of time with regards to first point (need to finish investment before April).

pm_me_your_anething;1517446982;7uexwv;;9;;2;"Hi. A couple of years ago, my parents got me a LIC Jeevan Labh policy. I didn't question much as I didn't know anything about investments or insurance. But as I read about its benefits now, it seems expensive. I have to invest 31k per year for 15 years and will approx get 11 lakhs for a sum assured of 5,70,000. Which is around 6.3% annualised profit. I assume its much better to get a term insurance for a higher sum assured and a much lower premium, and invest the rest in mutual funds? Also, since the policy will only cover me for 21 years, I will be left without life insurance when I need it the most? 

I have paid premiums for 2 years now, but cannot decide if I need to cancel it or just let it continue. Please advise. ";;LIC Jeevan Labh. Continue or close? Please advise;

reo_sam;1517519412;7um1o4;;19;;6;"1) Personal Tax Slabs &amp; Rates for All 

* No Change, so 2.5L for &lt;60 years, 3L for 60 to &lt;80 years, 5L for &gt;=80 years.

Effect- Nothing.

2) Salaried Class 

* Standard Deduction of 40,000.
* Older deductions of transport allowance and health ~~insurance~~ reimbursements go.
* *?? For business people, old deductions apply or go away = Not yet clear.*
* Effect = Minimum (around 5k) for those who could produce the bills for these. Good for those who couldn't, including Pensioners.

3) Senior Citizens

* Up to 50,000 interest from bank and post-office FD exempted (previously 10,000).
* Deduction limit for health insurance and/or medical expenditure raised to 50,000 (previously 30,000).
* Under section 80DDB, the deduction limit for certain critical illness medical expenses for senior citizen (Rs. 60,000) and very senior citizens (Rs. 80,000) has been raised to Rs 1 lakh. 
* The limits for the PM Vaya Vandana Yojana, that provides a pension plan with guaranteed returns of 8%, have been doubled to Rs 15 lakh.

Effect: Positive for senior citizens.

4) If IT returns are not filed within the date limits, then in addition to penalties, the deductions will not be allowed.

Effect: file your return.

5) Long Term Capital Gains Tax

* Applies on Equity Share, Equity oriented mutual fund or unit of a business trust.
* Redefinition of equity oriented MF = &gt;65% invested in domestic equities (this was old). Additionally, any feeder fund which invest in an ETF (traded on exchange is the phrase) which itself invests &gt;90% in domestic companies. This is to add any feeder funds which would have Etf like Bharat 22 etf, etc.

* Cost of acquisition would be considered as higher of Actual cost of acquisition and fair market value (selling price) on 31.1.18
* Rate = 10% on amount which is greater than 1Lakh of capital gains. And 10% as DDT on an equity-oriented MF.

Effect: sentimentally very bad. The dividend distribution plans would go haywire.

6) Housing for All

By 2022. Good for housing development companies.

Edit:

7) Cess from 3% to 4% for everything.

This is just bad policy. Restructuring everything and removing this would be better.

Edit 2:

8) There have been changes to Section 54EC. It'll apply for gains only from land or building and the gains will have to be kept in 5 year bonds.

9) Custom duties have been jacked up for almost everything and while it may or may not affect the official inflation rate, we'll have to pay more for everything that we buy that is manufactured in China and elsewhere.";;Budget 2018 Highlights;

Summary snippets copy-pasta from ET article:  

&gt;**""The new tax regime will be applicable to transfer made on or after 1st April, 2018**, the transfer made between 1st February, 2018 and 31st March, 2018 will be eligible for exemption under clause (38) of section 10 of the Act,"" it said. There had been confusion that the regime will apply to shares sold on or after February 1, the day of the budget. This also means there could be pressure on stock prices as investors sell shares to take advantage of the earlier regime till March 31. 

&amp;nbsp;  

&gt; **the long-term capital loss arising from transfer made on or after April 1, 2018 will be allowed to be set-off and carried forward in accordance with existing provisions of the Act.** 

&amp;nbsp;  

&gt; the long-term capital loss arising during this period: between February 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018,  will not be allowed to be set off or carried forward. 

&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;The capital gains tax will be levied on equity shares in a company listed on a recognised stock exchange, unit of an equity oriented fund and unit of a business trust. **There will be no deduction of tax at source from the payment of long-term capital gains to a resident tax payer.**
   
&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;However, tax at the rate of 10% will be deducted from payment of long-term capital gains to a nonresident tax payer except Foreign Institutional Investor (FIIs). 

&amp;nbsp;    

&gt;In the case of FIIs as well, there will be no tax on gains accrued up to 31st January, 2018. In case of bonus shares acquired before February 1, the gains up to January 31 will be exempt. 

-----

My thoughts: (Correct me if wrong) 

\* allowing set-off of Long Term Capital Losses: very reasonable move. One invests in equity expecting good earnings in the long term, and yet faces loss due to events beyond his control. IIRC this rule existed before the LTCG in equity became tax free (in 2004?)   

\* Are FIIs now liable to pay 10% tax on the gains from our equity markets? That would be a **huge** amount. Kudos!   

\* Investors might decide to just sell all profit stocks before 31March2018, and begin selling all LongTermLoss Stocks  from 1stApril.  

\* How about FIIs? Would they make a huge exit before 31March2018?  

\* What about [Wash Sale Rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp) ? I don't think we have any in India so far. (I am not talking about Dividend Stripping rule)   

\* One point from Capital Mind [article](https://capitalmind.in/2018/02/long-term-capital-gains-tax-back-budget-2018/)

&gt;A bad side effect is that this pushes people to insurance products which are usually toxic. The government should consider a tax on insurance proceeds if you “surrender” a policy or get “maturity” benefits, again, grandfathered to the current date. But usually it’s abuse that drives taxation, so this will happen next year.

anku94;1518563455;7xdk4g;;26;;19;"As someone who thinks of himself as somewhat financially literate, this was an absolute shocker.

I received my CC bill for ₹27,750 on 12th Jan. On 30th Jan (the due date), I did not remember the exact amount I had to pay, and was too lazy to search for the statement, so I paid ₹25,000. I knew it was less than the bill amount by 1000-2000 bucks, but I was like 3% monthly interest on 2000 is 60 rupees, I'll check and pay it in a couple of days.

THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS.

If you miss a payment by more than a couple of rupees, what effectively happens is that your interest free period is suspended, from the date of generation of the previous statement. In effect, since my previous statement was generated on 12th Jan, all transactions from then until today were accumulating an interest of 3% per month. I *also* need to pay interest on the 25,000 I *did pay* from a period of 15th Jan to 30th Jan.

There is absolutely no warning or alert from the bank that my credit card is accumulating 100 rupees in interest daily. They do explain it with an example in the T&amp;Cs, but the numbers used are so innocuous that what you see is 134 rupees in interest levied on a non-payment of 3000 rupees in bill, and you think to yourself - this is not too bad (for a rainy day, that is).

Worst part is that you don't have a legal basis to fight this. You owe the bank the transaction amount from the day you executed a transaction. At 39% pa. The only reason you can get away with not paying until the end of the month is because the bank, as a _goodwill gesture_, gives you a grace period. This grace period is at the liberty of the bank, and can be withdrawn when specific conditions (mentioned in the T&amp;Cs) are met. When that happens, they recover all the points and cashbacks you slaved away for.

- GST and stamp duty = 5
- STT = 2

- GST and stamp duty = 6

1. Purchase in liquid fund using PayEezz: I initiated a purchase in  liquid fund and specified PayEezz. The order was on 1st February before 8 AM. The money was debited from my bank account only on 2nd February, and was transferred to the MF late on 5th February. Which means that my units were allotted with effective date 4th February, while I'd have expected 1st February. **Moral**: Don't use MF Utility with PayEezz for Liquid fund purchases. 

2. I requested a liquid fund redemption before 8 AM on 19th February. The trail looks like this:

* Order Requested 	19-02-2018 00:23:53

Concluding paragraphs:   

&gt;Real estate investments must be evaluated in the normal terms of any investment--liquidity, safety, transparency, returns and similar parameters. Most people are led astray about this because there is a fundamental difference between your first house where you live in and property bought purely for investment. The first house is a need and when you take into account the fact you can stop paying rent and get a tax break on the EMIs, you know that it is a big financial advantage.  
&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;Real estate cheerleaders will always give you examples of how some house became 50 or 100 times its value in 40 to 50 years. However, that's not much. The BSE Sensex has become 300 times its value in 38 years. In any case, that was the past.

In finance, there is a concept called intrinsic value. An asset’s value is essentially driven by the (discounted) value of the future cash that asset will generate. For example, when Hertz buys a car, its value is the profit they get from renting it out and selling the car at the end of its life (the “terminal value”). For Hertz, a car is an investment. When you buy a car, unless you make money from it somehow, its value corresponds to its resale value. Since a car is a depreciating asset, the amount of value that the car loses over its lifetime is a very real expense you pay.

A diamond is a depreciating asset masquerading as an investment. There is a common misconception that jewellery and precious metals are assets that can store value, appreciate, and hedge against inflation. That’s not wholly untrue.
Gold and silver are commodities that can be purchased on financial markets. They can appreciate and hold value in times of inflation. You can even hoard gold under your bed and buy gold coins and bullion (albeit at a ~10% premium to market rates). If you want to hoard gold jewellery however, there is typically a 100-400% retail markup so that’s probably not a wise investment. 
But with that caveat in mind, the market for gold is fairly liquid and gold is fungible - you can trade one large piece of gold for ten smalls ones like you can a ten dollar bill for a ten one dollar bills. These characteristics make it a feasible potential investment.
Diamonds, however, are not an investment. The market for them is neither liquid nor are they fungible.

The first test of a liquid market is whether you can resell a diamond. In a famous piece published by The Atlantic in 1982, Edward Epstein explains why you can’t sell used diamonds for anything but a pittance:
Retail jewellers, especially the prestigious Fifth Avenue stores, prefer not to buy back diamonds from customers because the offer they would make would most likely be considered ridiculously low. The “keystone,” or markup, on a diamond and its setting may range from 100 to 200 percent, depending on the policy of the store; if it bought diamonds back from customers, it would have to buy them back at wholesale prices. 


**…**


Most jewellers would prefer not to make a customer an offer that might be deemed insulting and also might undercut the widely held notion that diamonds go up in value. Moreover, since retailers generally receive their diamonds from wholesalers on consignment, and need not pay for them until they are sold, they would not readily risk their own cash to buy diamonds from customers.
When you buy a diamond, you buy it at retail, which is a 100% to 200% markup. If you want to resell it, you have to pay less than wholesale to incent a diamond buyer to risk their own capital on the purchase. Given the large markup, this will mean a substantial loss on your part. The same article puts some numbers around the dilemma:
Because of the steep markup on diamonds, individuals who buy retail and in effect sell wholesale often suffer enormous losses. For example, Brod estimates that a half-carat diamond ring, which might cost $2,000 at a retail jewellery store, could be sold for only $600 at Empire.
Some diamonds are perhaps investment grade, but you probably don’t own one, even if you spent a lot.


The appraisers at Empire Diamonds examine thousands of diamonds a month but rarely turn up a diamond of extraordinary quality. Almost all the diamonds they find are slightly flawed, off-colour, commercial-grade diamonds. The chief appraiser says, “When most of these diamonds were purchased, American women were concerned with the size of the diamond, not its intrinsic quality.” He points out that the setting frequently conceals flaws, and adds, “The sort of flawless, investment-grade diamond one reads about is almost never found in jewellery.”
As with televisions and mattresses, the diamond classification scheme is extremely complicated. Diamonds are not fungible and can’t be easily exchanged with each other. Diamond professionals use the 4 C’s when classifying and pricing diamonds: carats, colour, cut, and clarity. Due to the complexity of these 4 dimensions, it’s hard to make apples to apples comparisons between diamonds.


But even when looking at the value of one stone, professionals seem like they’re just making up diamond prices:
In 1977, for example, Jewelers’ Circular Keystone polled a large number of retail dealers and found a difference of over 100 percent in offers for the same quality of investment-grade diamonds.
So let’s be very clear, a diamond is not an investment. You might want one because it looks pretty or its status symbol to have a “massive rock”, but not because it will store value or appreciate in value.
But among all the pretty, shiny things out there - gold and silver, rubies and emeralds - why do Americans covet diamond engagement rings in the first place?
A Diamond is Forever a Measure of your Manhood
""The reason you haven’t felt it is that it doesn’t exist. What you call love was invented by guys like me, to sell nylons.""

We like diamonds because Gerold M. Lauck told us to. Until the mid 20th century, diamond engagement rings were a small and dying industry in America. Nor had the concept really taken hold in Europe. Moreover, with Europe on the verge of war, it didn’t seem like a promising place to invest. 
Not surprisingly, the American market for diamond engagement rings began to shrink during the Great Depression. Sales volume declined and the buyers that remained purchased increasingly smaller stones. But the US market for engagement rings was still 75% of De Beers’ sales. If De Beers was going to grow, it had to reverse the trend.
And so, in 1938, De Beers turned to Madison Avenue for help. They hired Gerold Lauck and the N. W. Ayer advertising agency, who commissioned a study with some astute observations. Men were the key to the market:
Since “young men buy over 90% of all engagement rings” it would be crucial to inculcate in them the idea that diamonds were a gift of love: the larger and finer the diamond, the greater the expression of love. Similarly, young women had to be encouraged to view diamonds as an integral part of any romantic courtship.
However, there was a dilemma. Many smart and prosperous women didn’t want diamond engagement rings. They wanted to be different. 


The millions of brides and brides-to-be are subjected to at least two important pressures that work against the diamond engagement ring. Among the more prosperous, there is the sophisticated urge to be different as a means of being smart…. the lower-income groups would like to show more for the money than they can find in the diamond they can afford…
Lauck needed to sell a product that people either did not want or could not afford. His solution would haunt men for generations. He advised that De Beers market diamonds as a status symbol:
 ”The substantial diamond gift can be made a more widely sought symbol of personal and family success — an expression of socio-economic achievement.”
…


""Promote the diamond as one material object which can reflect, in a very personal way, a man’s … success in life.""
The next time you look at a diamond, consider this. Nearly every American marriage begins with a diamond because a bunch of rich white men in the 1940s convinced everyone that its size determines your self-worth. They created this convention - that unless a man purchases (an intrinsically useless) diamond, his life is a failure - while sitting in a room, racking their brains on how to sell diamonds that no one wanted. 
With this insight, they began marketing diamonds as a symbol of status and love:
Movie idols, the paragons of romance for the mass audience, would be given diamonds to use as their symbols of indestructible love. In addition, the agency suggested offering stories and society photographs to selected magazines and newspapers which would reinforce the link between diamonds and romance. Stories would stress the size of diamonds that celebrities presented to their loved ones, and photographs would conspicuously show the glittering stone on the hand of a well-known woman. 

Fashion designers would talk on radio programs about the “trend towards diamonds” that Ayer planned to start. The Ayer plan also envisioned using the British royal family to help foster the romantic allure of diamonds. 
Even the royal family was in on the hoax! The campaign paid immediate dividends. Within 3 years, despite the Great Depression, diamond sales in the US increased 55%! Twenty years later, an entire generation believed that an expensive diamond ring was a necessary step in the marriage process. 
The De Beers marketing machine continued to churn out the hits. They circulated marketing materials suggesting, apropos of nothing, that a man should spend one month’s salary on a diamond ring. It worked so well that De Beers arbitrarily decided to increase the suggestion to two months salary. That’s why you think that you need to spend two month’s salary on a ring - because the suppliers of the product said so.
Today, over 80% of women in the US receive diamond rings when they get engaged. The domination is complete.

What, you might ask, could top institutionalizing demand for a useless product out of thin air? Monopolizing the supply of diamonds for over a century to make that useless product extremely expensive. You see, diamonds aren’t really even that rare.
Before 1870, diamonds were very rare. They typically ended up in a Maharaja’s crown or a royal necklace. In 1870, enormous deposits of diamonds were discovered in Kimberley, South Africa. As diamonds flooded the market, the financiers of the mines realized they were making their own investments worthless. As they mined more and more diamonds, they became less scarce and their price dropped.


The diamond market may have bottomed out were it not for an enterprising individual by the name of Cecil Rhodes. He began buying up mines in order to control the output and keep the price of diamonds high. By 1888, Rhodes controlled the entire South African diamond supply, and in turn, essentially the entire world supply. One of the companies he acquired was eponymously named after its founders, the De Beers brothers.
Building a diamond monopoly isn’t easy work. It requires a balance of ruthlessly punishing and cooperating with competitors, as well as a very long term view. 

For example, in 1902, prospectors discovered a massive mine in South Africa that contained as many diamonds as all of De Beers’ mines combined. The owners initially refused to join the De Beers cartel, joining three years later after new owner Ernest Oppenheimer recognized that a competitive market for diamonds would be disastrous for the industry:
Common sense tells us that the only way to increase the value of diamonds is to make them scarce, that is to reduce production.
Here’s how De Beers has controlled the diamond supply chain for most of the last century. De Beers owns most of the diamond mines. For mines that they don’t own, they have historically bought out all the diamonds, intimidating or co-opting any that think of resisting their monopoly. They then transfer all the diamonds over to the Central Selling Organization (CSO), which they own. 
The CSO sorts through the diamonds puts them in boxes and presents them to the 250 partners that they sell to. The price of the diamonds and quantity of diamonds are non-negotiable - it’s take it or leave it. Refuse your boxes and you’re out of the diamond industry.
For most of the 20th century, this system has controlled 90% of the diamond trade and been solely responsible for the inflated price of diamonds. However, as Oppenheimer took over leadership at De Beers, he keenly assessed the primary operational risk that the company faced:
Our only risk is the sudden discovery of new mines, which human nature will work recklessly to the detriment of us all.
Because diamonds are “valuable”, there will always be the risk of entrepreneurs finding new sources of diamonds. Although controlling the discoverers of new mines often actually meant working with communists. In 1957, the Soviet Union discovered a massive deposit of diamonds in Siberia. Though the diamonds were a bit on the smallish side, De Beers still had to swoop in and buy all of them from the Soviets, lest they risk the supply being unleashed on the world market. 
 
Later, in Australia, a large supply of coloured diamonds was discovered. When the mine refused to join the syndicate, De Beers retaliated by unloading massive amounts of coloured diamonds that were similar to the Australian ones to drive down their price. Similarly, in the 1970s, some Israeli members of the CSO started stockpiling the diamonds they were allocated rather than reselling them. This made it difficult for De Beers to control the market price and would eventually cause a deflation in diamond prices when the hoarders released their stockpile. Eventually, these offending members were banned from the CSO, essentially shutting them out from the diamond business.
In 2000, De Beers announced that they were relinquishing their monopoly on the diamond business. They even settled a US Antitrust lawsuit related to price fixing industrial diamonds to the tune of $10 million (How generous! What is that, the price of one investment banker’s engagement ring?). 
Today, De Beers hold on the industry supply chain is less strong. And yet, price continue to rise as new deposits haven’t been found recently and demand for diamonds is increasing in India and China. For now, it’s less necessary that the company monopolize the supply chain because its lie that a diamond is a proxy for a man’s worth in life has infected the rest of the world.

**Conclusion**

“I didn’t get a bathroom door that looks like a wall by being bad at business”
Jack Donaghy,30 Rock

We covet diamonds in America for a simple reason: the company that stands to profit from diamond sales decided that we should. De Beers’ marketing campaign single-handedly made diamond rings the measure of one’s success in America. Despite its complete lack of inherent value, the company manufactured an image of diamonds as a status symbol. And to keep the price of diamonds high, despite the abundance of new diamond finds, De Beers executed the most effective monopoly of the 20th century. Okay, we get it De Beers, you guys are really good at business! 


The purpose of this post was to point out that diamond engagement rings are a lie - they’re an invention of Madison Avenue and De Beers. This post has completely glossed over the sheer amount of human suffering that we’ve caused by believing this lie: conflict diamonds funding wars, supporting apartheid for decades with our money, and pillaging the earth to find shiny carbon. And while we’re on the subject, why is it that women need to be asked and presented with a ring in order to get married? Why can’t they ask and do the presenting?
Diamonds are not actually scarce, make a terrible investment, and are purely valuable as a status symbol.

caffeineismylife;1519974468;81chue;;18;;9;"I had posted recently about asset allocation in the post mentioned below. The basic question was – what are the pros and cons of using Nifty PE as a guide to tactical asset allocation. Asset allocation here refers to allocation between equity (MF and not direct equity) and debt for monthly investment purchase only. This does NOT refer to selling any part of the portfolio. The goal is retirement in another 10 years and the portfolio will be sold only for that need.

https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/7r7gfm/please_critique_my_asset_allocation_plan/?st=je8ioc3s&amp;sh=89f1b3bc

The objective is to minimize price risk – ie ensure we don’t buy too much equity at high prices. While most people say 10 years is enough to mitigate this risk – if you analyse equity bought at peaks in 2008 and at PE above 24, long term returns are lower than FD and certainly don’t beat inflation over the period.

u/NamitNasih gave me the good idea of validating with a backtest. Sharing the results below:

**Analysis:**  - looked at data from 1 Jan 2003 to 24 Jan 2018. For equity took the HDFC top 200 fund and for debt took Franklin Short Income plan. Assumed that Rs 100 was invested everyday.

**Case 1 (Control)**

Zero timing – fixed asset allocation of 60:40  - Equity:Debt

Results: 

Total portfolio value: 13,79,068

Equity portfolio value: 10,83,592

Debt portfolio value: 2,95,476

How did we manage price risk: average purchase price per equity unit: Rs 98

**Case 2:**

Moderate timing – had differing asset allocation ratios basis the following PE bands:  

0-12: 100:0


12-21: 70%

22-24: 60%


24-26: 50%

26-28: 40%

28+: 0

Results:

Total portfolio value: 15,18,091

Equity portfolio value: 12,79,082

Debt portfolio value: 2,39,009

How did we manage price risk: average purchase price per equity unit: Rs 92

Overall – we land up with a portfolio that is 10% more than the fixed allocation portfolio

**Case 3:**

Aggressive timing

8-15: 100:0

16-18: 75:25

18-20: 60:40

20-22: 50:50

22-24: 25:75

24+ - all debt

Results:

Total portfolio value: 16,47,691

Equity portfolio value: 13,85,411

Debt portfolio value: 2,62,280

How did we manage price risk: average purchase price per equity unit: Rs 75 – a whopping 23% less than case 1

Overall – we land up with a portfolio that is 19% more than the fixed allocation portfolio

OK – so one might say – the price bands are fixed in such a manner that equity is bought more. And yes – the number of equity units are higher in case 2 and 3. So let’s try Case 4 – another zero timing scenario but more equity-focused than before.

**Case 4:**

Fixed asset allocation: 80:20

Results:

Total portfolio value: 15,92,527

Equity portfolio value: 14,44,789

Debt portfolio value: 1,47,738

How did we manage price risk: average purchase price per equity unit: Rs 92 (same as 1)

Overall – portfolio value is 15% more than case 1.

Final rank by price risk: 3,2,1/4

Final rank by portfolio value: 3,4,2,1

**Thoughts :**

Case 3 seems to offer the best: highest value portfolio but with a healthy debt cushion. This is where case 4 fails. While it is third ranked in results – the debt portion is too low to give a conservative investor like myself comfort

Caveat – this is a point-to-point study and results are influenced by how well equities are doing at the moment. In a downturn results would be different – all the more reason why good debt cushion is important!

Common wisdom is that  (fixed ratio) SIP is best. However this seems a better way to achieve dollar cost averaging by buying more when low/buying less when high. Also SIP may be useful to people from a behavioural finance POV – but for someone like myself who saves pretty effortlessly but wants to learn to invest right – not convinced about effectiveness of fixed SIP

&gt;Those who keep an eye on insurance related news would recently have noticed headlines about the Delhi High Court striking down health insurers' practice of disallowing coverage of genetic disorders. The particular issues relate to whether the insurer inserted the 'genetic disorder' exclusion during a renewal and whether the customer's condition was, in fact, genetic. Based on these issues, the trial court ruled in favour of the customer and obviously, the insurance company went to the high court.

&gt;The Delhi High Court took a larger view of the issue and also considered whether a general exclusion based on the broad label 'genetic disorders' should be done and even more broadly, should a person's genetic inheritance be used as a basis of any kind of discrimination at all. The court ruled against the insurance company on all these issues. Since this 'genetic disorder' exclusion is allowed by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and enforced by all health insurance companies (both facts noted in the judgement), there will have to be an industry wide change of practice.

&gt;Also, in the judgement, there is direct as well as implied criticism of IRDA on a number of issues. The judgement notes that IRDA's guidelines for health insurance, issued in 2013, disallows congenital and genetic disorders without defining them. In 2016, IRDA issued a revised version which defined congenital disorders but neglected to define genetic ones. Moreover, these exclusions are not based on any empirical data or any data based observations that IRDA has made.

&gt;In passing, the judgement also observes that the latest guidelines cannot be found on IRDA's website. Consumers always knew that IRDA's website is less than useful, now this fact has been enshrined in a high court judgement! Perhaps the regulator will be moved to finally do something about this. Still, based on past experience, one can't be too hopeful.

&gt;**The judgement then goes on to classify and define genetic disorders and comes to the conclusion that the term is too imprecise and generalised and potentially gives the insurance companies the leeway to reject a lot of common conditions in an arbitrary manner.** Upping the ante beyond that, the court has ruled that even if genetic disorders are defined, they cannot be used to deny health insurance. It says, **'...the broad exclusion of genetic disorders from insurance contracts/claims is illegal and unconstitutional.'**

&gt;There are two basic problems that the judgement, by implication, points out. One is that **IRDA has legitimised exclusions without any empirical proof or scientific reasoning. If a rigorous examination is made of other exclusions, many more could be found to be essentially arbitrary. Most importantly, this could be the case with exclusions that are made not just in health insurance, but in life insurance too.** The question immediately arises as to who will force IRDA to conduct this introspection. The answer is there in the judgement. **'(Insurance) contracts have to be based on empirical testing and data and cannot be simply on the basis of subjective or vague factors. It is for lawmakers to take the necessary steps in this regard.'** This clearly and unambiguously calls for an amendment in the law and not just action by IRDA.

&gt;There is a second, even more important issue. Over the past years, there would have been many thousands of claims that have been denied to customers for genetic disorders. The clear implication of this judgement is that ALL those denials were violative of customers' rights, illegal and unconstitutional. How will the past victims of this illegality be compensated? The only answer that can deliver justice is that India should have class action suits. In cases like the above, when the court feels that an identical injustice must been done to thousands of others, it should be able to expand the case to include all those instances.";;A landmark HC judgement points out that health insurers' policy exclusions for genetic conditions are illegal and unconstitutional;

Here's how it goes: open account, full on cheer leading in the beginning, suggesting investment options and so on. At that time, I thought it really thoughtful of the CR rep to be taking personal interest in my investment decisions. A week later, the risk averse me, considering all options proposed to me by the rep, decide against the fancy bank initiated schemes and go old school and open an FD.

From then on, numerous messages asking me why I don't consider ULIP, endowment policies and the works. So I tell the rep off that you've made your point and I've made my decision, please don't be pushy. A month later, same behavior resumes. I say no again, and this time the response is ""Hope you understand. Apart from providing service, I have sales targets to meet""

I feel bad for the rep cos it's a systemic problem: private banks incentivizing such predatory sales to boost their profits. Nonetheless, the irritation is real. I feel like shutting myself off from the rep completely. I mean, I am giving the bank business, by parking my cash there and opening FD. Why such predatory behavior?

tinbin3;1521078048;84iv6v;;19;;5;"My parents were told at their local SBI branch that there is a savings cum insurance scheme, where if they put 1 lakh each year for 5 years, they will get 10 lakhs at the end of 10 years ( with the definition of 10 years being not very clear to my parents when I asked). It also comes with an insurance, so if something happens to the person, the nominee gets 10 lakhs. 

Similar to it, there was another scheme where if you put 1.5 lakhs each year for 5 years, return is 15 lakhs and assured insurance amount is 30 lakhs!

Anyone heard of any such schemes? I could not find something online, have asked them to ask names of schemes and any brochures etc from the branch. Let's see.

hazyshadow666;1521126506;84n5pj;;9;;2;"Hello everyone. I am pretty new to the world of investments. I have a question on equity intra day trading:

Yesterday I opened an account with Zerodha to start off equity intra day:

Below is a scenario:


EQUITY INTRA DAY STATS FOR ONE DAY:

BS1: I bought 500 stocks of W at 200rs each. Sold it at 201. Bought 100000 worth, Sold it at 101000. (Profit = 1000)

BS2: I bought 500 stocks of X at 400rs each . Sold it at 401.Bought 200000 worth ,Sold it at 200500. (Profit =500)

BS3 :I bought 500 stocks of Y at 200rs each. Sold it at 199. Bought 100000 worth, sold it at 99500 (Loss=500)

BS4: I bought 500 stocks of Z at 400rs each. Sold it at 399. Bought 200000 worth, sold it at 199500 (Loss=500)


Assumptions:

- I do the above for 150 days in a row.(Convenience for understanding, please exclude weekends when i say, in a row)
- All 150 days are in the same financial year and occur before the tax filing limit.
- I am a salaried employee and after deductions, 5.5l is still taxable.

Could someone explain to me how the taxation works? 
I understand tax for my salary, but not for the intra day part. (Read on the internet that its speculation based and turnover is what is taxed on, but the definition of turnover confused me so much that I am lost now.)

Thanks for your patience in reading the post. Would highly appreciate your inputs!

In the last few months, there has been a lot of changes regarding taxation on PPF accounts for NRIs. If anyone can clarify some of my questions it would be awesome!

1. Can NRI keep / continue having PPF account?
2. Is it advisable to extend the PPF term considering changing govt. policies regarding PPF account for NRI?
3. Wound interest rates on NRI PPF accounts be same as resident PPF accounts?

Main points:

* Equities, not housing, have been the best long-run investment, contrary to  recent claims

* Globally, the returns and risks from housing have been between those on equities and bonds
* Gold has given poor returns, high volatility, and been a poor inflation hedge
* Collectibles such as art, wine and musical instruments have beaten cash and government bonds
* Episodes of volatility, as in early 2018, are hard to predict, tell us little about future returns, and appear as mere blips in the long secular rise of equities
* We should expect lower investment returns in future on all asset classes
* Value investors have experienced a lost decade, but there is no guarantee that is about to change

I found an Infosys call option that costs 82.75 per share, with a strike price of 620, due to expire in March. [This is what I'm talking about](https://i.imgur.com/lGaXzF9.png)

If my understanding is right, if I buy this, I can buy 600 stocks of infy on 29 march at 620 per share by paying 80 rupees per share now. Right now, Infosys is at 1171. It is extremely unlikely it'll crash to 700 (620 + 82) by March end, given that it is a solid company. If it ends up at 1100, I stand to make a profit of (1100 - 700) * 600 = Rs 2.4 lakh from an investment of 48k.

They kept parroting the same lines that every card had its own terms and conditions and that I had agreed to them when I signed up for the card.

kuchbhida;1521904822;86to0q;;10;;30;"I recently exited my first PMS investment (ICICI Pipe but this isnt about a specific PMS and likely applies to all) and thought I would share some data about my returns and hope that it helps others better understand real returns.

When I made my investment in a PMS, while I found anecdotal feedback, no independent data was available. There is enough obfuscated charges that I miscalculated what the actual fee was and what the returns would be. Keep in mind the premise of a PMS is that it will substantially outperform the benchmark and hence marketed as superior to MF (but I did know its at a higher risk).

In my case for the period that I was invested in...

BSE Small cap Index (Its benchmark) grew by: 68%
My Folio grew by : 42%
Fees charged: 17%
Taxes due: 6% (Unlike MF, I have to pay short term and long term capital gains tax on each transaction)
Returns after taxes and fees: 19%
Of this another 11% has not yet been refunded as its in some unlisted equity and unclear when and how much I will get back.
Hence real absolute return is 8% net (not annualized, which is even lower) and their fee is far higher than any other component while the benchmark in that period (according to their own data on my folio) grew at 68%.

Their fees included the following components
1. Setup Fee
2. STP Charges
3. Fund Accounting Fees
4. Management Fees
5. Custody Charges
6. Audit Charges
7. DEMAT Charges
8. Performance Fees
9. Taxes

Yes it under performed and although I dont see why that shouldnt be considered as a negative for something marketed to outperform but the key is that the charges ensure that you will never really make better returns than an MF targeting the same benchmark.

So anyone considering anything other than MF, hope this has added some alternate color. Do check closely all types of fees, ask for actual scenarios and if ideally talk to someone who has invested in that instrument through a full market cycle. It was an expensive lesson for me.";9256;PMS Returns: My experience with PMS;

ry9nrd;1521968232;86zmwt;;3;;8;"I've recently started intraday trading on a very small scale as I'm a beginner. I use Zerodha's online brokerage calculator before executing any trades. I've noticed that the amount credited to my account at the end of the day is always a little less than the amount shown by the brokerage calculator. 

For eg- Suppose I buy 200 shares of SBI at 245 each and sell all 200 shares at 245.30. So as per Zerodha's brokerage calculator, my net profit should be 32.51. 

If I make 5 such trades(Assume same price, i.e - Buy at 245 and sell at 245.30) my total profit for the day should have been 5 x 32.51 = Rs. 162.55. 

But I've noticed that Zerodha always deducts some amount from the total profit! What am I missing? The brokerage calculator accounts for all necessary taxes before showing the profit/loss so why is zerodha deducting an additional amount?";9268;Zerodha brokerage fee confusion;

This used to be a UST fund with ~ 6 months modified duration and very high credit quality (basically a super safe UST).

The primary change seems to be that the fund will start participating in interest rate futures to hedge against interest rate volatility.  How does this change the nature of the fund? What does it do to risk? Also it's not too clear to me if they are limiting the extent of hedging. It also mentions that the fund will use various derivative products - but there are no fund-specific restrictions and risk management is at AMC level.

cynical_bibliophile;1522052900;877jxm;;21;;20;"I've been trying to do some analysis on mutual funds from the past few days, and here is the first set of results.

About the data:
NAV data for 104 large cap equity funds was collected, including index funds and ETFs. The funds were mostly regular with growth option, and data was collected since 1st Jan 2002. 1Y rolling returns and 3Y rolling returns was then calculated from NAV data.

Analysis:
Two strategies were compared, the first one buying the fund with best 1Y rolling return against best 3Y rolling return. Rs. 100 was invested everyday since 3rd Jan 2005, until 16th March 2018, and the total invested amount came out to be 3.25 lakhs.

Net value for 1Y strategy: 7.97 lakhs (absolute returns: 145.21%)
Net value for 3Y strategy: 8.09 lakhs (absolute returns: 148.83%)

Observations: 3Y rolling returns seems to do slightly better most of the time.

Caveats:
1. Some data points were missing for some funds in the early 2006 and before and in that case no investment was made on those days.

Let me know what you think, and if you have any strategy that you would want me to test, or any suggestions, please comment!

hardshock;1522063723;878djp;;20;;10;"For those who are not salaried employees and are in the lowest tax slab, is it always prudent to max out the 80C limit?

I, for example, haven't utilized even a bit of it yet for the current FY. I would have loved to invest a sizable portion in ELSS funds (esp. Motilal ELSS) but I feel that the past couple of quarters and those to follow are going to be quite volatile due to premium valuations, political instability and various global events, in that particular order.

I'm not particularly keen to invest in 5-year FDs as well as I find them to be very inefficient after adjusting the returns with  tax and inflation. Locking the funds for 5 years for no substantial gain is a no for me.

Coming to PPF, liquidity is slightly important for me for the next couple of years. So this is ruled out too. I just opened and started warming an Account though.

So now that it's been established that 80C might not be the correct fit for me, I've come up with the following calculations.

80C investment|Tax liability|Notional Savings|Notional Cost|Notional %|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
110000|6267|40000|3914|9.79|
85000|7500|65000|5147|7.92|
60000|8842|90000|6489|7.21|
40000|9870|110000|7517|6.83|
20000|10900|135000|8547|6.57|
500|11907|149500|9554|6.39|

For example, in the last scenario, I just exhausted Rs. 500 of the 80C limit for PPF. So my net tax payable is Rs. 11,907. Had I exausted the complete 80C limit, my net tax payable would have been Rs. 2,353. Hence, in order to prevent Rs. 1,49,500 from being locked in for 5 years, my notional cost would be Rs. 9,554 (11907-2353). Therefore, the rate of return required to recoup the notional cost would be 9554/149500 i.e., 6.39%. A similar logic would apply to all the other scenarios in the aforementioned table.

Continuing the last scenario's example itself, instead of locking in the Rs. 1,49,500 for 5 years, even if I just invest it in a one year corporate bond which yields around 10% interest, I would be recouping the extra tax of Rs. 9,554 that I paid. After one year, if I'm comfortable with investing in the equity market again, I can invest the matured bond in it.

The only downside that I see in this plan is that a major portion of the returns of the first year of the bonds would be sufficient just to recoup the extra tax of 6.39% that I paid. Only when that is recovered, the Rs. 1,49,500 would start generating wealth.

What do you guys think about this plan? Is it good to go or are there any loopholes that I'm missing out on? Any feedback would be really helpful. Cheers!

hapuchu;1522138773;87gqrc;;28;;19;"Purpose of this post is to try and figure out, at a given instance, should you be holding a concentrated portfolio or a diversified one? Do note that, if you are expecting a “holy grail” answer to this question then you will be disappointed! This post will attempt to answer the question; if the number of companies you should be is invested in should be towards YOUR lower range or higher range.

---

**Point #1**

Question: Why do we diversify? (Diversify in this context means investing in various companies)
Answer: To reduce risk!

Consider this: If you want 25% returns and you are 100% certain that A PARTICULAR COMPANY is definitely going to give 30% returns then shouldn’t you put ALL your money in THAT 1 COMPANY?

Reason we diversify is because we want to protect ourselves from THAT ONE UNKNOWN EVENT that can make us lose our capital!

**To summarize point #1: We diversify (buy multiple companies) to reduce risk!**

---
**Point #2**

Let’s put risk on a scale of 1 to 10; where 1 means least risky atmosphere and 10 means most risky atmosphere. Let’s also assume we are comfortable holding between 5 to 25 companies. (NOTE: This range can be different for different people.)

When the risk is approaching 10, the number of companies we hold should approach 25 as that is supposed to reduce risk via diversification (see point #1); CONTRARILY when risk approaches 1 the number of companies we hold should approach 5!

**To summarize point #2: Higher risk least to diversified portfolio and lower risk leads to concentrated portfolio!**

---

**Point #3**

If we are settled on point #1 and point #2 then last piece of puzzle is to figure out if we are approaching risk towards 10 or 1?

This is straight-forward. If rate of increase in price is greater than rate of increase in earnings then we can say that the company is getting expensive. And buying something that is expensive is risky. And we can say that risk is approaching 10! (Basically, if PE is increasing then risk is increasing.)

Contrarily when the earnings are growing faster than the price or is price is de-growing/falling with constant earnings then we can say that the company is getting cheaper and a good asset at cheaper price is less risky. (Basically if PE is reducing then risk is decreasing. Of course, the fundamentals of all the companies that we hold should be great.)

**To summarize point #3: Higher PE means higher risk and lower PE means lower risk. (For a company with great fundamentals and all other things staying constant.)**

---
**So if we put the above 3 points together than we can conclude that:**

When the PE of the market (or our portfolio) is increasing then we should reduce risk by diversifying into more companies and when the PE of the market (or our portfolio) is decreasing then we hold a concentrated portfolio.

This concept looks counter-intuitive as many investors tend to increase the number of companies they hold when the market/portfolio is falling! They end up doing this as they are seeing “bargains and discounts” everywhere and the FOMO (fear of missing out) factor makes them dip into every falling stock!

freewheelin_zee;1522159213;87imfr;;46;;34;"TL;DR: Took me over a year to develop a profitable day trading system. How has the journey been for you? are you profitable already? 

I am a software person by academia and interest but during the past year or so I've been fascinated by the financial markets. 

I started off with a simple buy today sell tomorrow strategy which came without any effort and made about 20% profit the very first month.. which obviously makes a newbie think that ""if I can make 20% in the very first month, I can probably get better and make more"". (New comers luck)

And that's when shit hits the fan. fan being the attractive Intraday margins. 
over the next few months I made small losses which over time summed up to a total loss of about 20k. 

during these few months I started exploring ways to better my intraday game. I was hooked to it!

I started off with excel sheets with months of stock data trying to analyse the stocks prices.

None of it worked. 

then I moved towards the quants. gathered huge amounts of data, started off with the usual suspects of technical analysis algos, mean reversal, hurst exponent, ran statistical analysis, etc etc. 
Long story short. none of it turned a profit. some strategies worked in a particular market condition, most didn't.

eventually I made myself a sophisticated piece of software that picked out the most influencing factors on realtime basis and I can set the parameters according to market conditions. 

Things are looking good now. I don't need to rely of ""TIPS"" or luck or technical analysis.. 
It's basically like watching the news for stocks that may potentially go up or down but knowing it before the news channels pick it up!

Now I'm slowing recovering my loses.. 

So that's my story.

I assume most people will not have the patience to go through loss after loss for a year to find out a working strategy but still I am extremely curious to know if there are any succesful day traders out there and what sort of an experience have you guys had! 

would love to hear your story,

&gt; So what does Value Research Stock Advisor do?
The answer is simple. As the name suggests, it advises you on which stocks to buy. Our research team maintains a list of stocks that you should invest in. All you have to do is invest in them and make profits. When any of the stocks are collapsing, we tell you to sell them. What could be more simple?
What exactly will I get?
Unlike many of our other products, this is a purely web-based service, which you access through www.valueresearchstocks.com. There is no print equivalent that will be shipped to you.
On this website, you will get access to our list of recommended stocks. Broadly, these consist of two categories:
1) All-weather Stocks
2) Timely Stocks
The names are self-descriptive. All-weather stocks are the ones that we think you can hold for a long time. The advantages these stocks have are fundamental and we don't expect them to become unworthy of ownership for years. And years. And years. Of course, the point of holding a stock is to grow your money. We expect our all-weather stocks to do better than the rest of the market and economy in a sustained manner.

I told him I was no longer working for the said company and I had started my own business. At that point he paused and then said it may be difficult to obtain a loan for businessmen. I said that's OK because I didn't actually need a loan.

However he went on to ask if I still possessed the ID-card from the company I was working with previously. When I asked why, he said he could still process the personal loan completing the paperwork as if I was still a salaried person. All I had to submit was my Appointment Letter (of the company I had already left), the photocopy of ID-card of that company and a few salary slips.

Now it was my turn to take a pause. I wondered if this was actually happening - a bank employee advising me to forge my paperwork simply in order to process a personal loan he was willing to sell which I didn't even need. So after a long pause, I asked him if he was serious. At this point he realized my discomfort and said sorry and hung up the phone.";9401;AXIS Bank Employee Advised me to Fake my Paperwork while Selling Me a Personal Loan;

Lombdi;1523694902;8c6c49;;22;;19;"Hello,

I'm asking this question for a second/third/subsequent house as an investment, not for self use. Let's say there is a ready-possession 2Bhk apartment in Mumbai that costs Rs.1,60,00,000 to buy inclusive of stamp duty, registration, GST, etc. 

Present Rent Receivable is Rs.40,000 per month. 

Monthly Maintenance (society levies, water charges, property taxes etc; but excluding electricity) of the apartment is Rs.5,000 per month.

Upfront payment is Rs.24,00,000. I could take a 10 year long loan for remaining Rs.1,36,00,000 at interest rate of 8.5% which makes the EMI approximately Rs.1,60,000

Let's say the area is fairly developed already and property rates are appreciating at 4%-6% pa. 

The yearly income+appreciation is substantially less than loanEMI+liabilities as per my rough napkin calculations, so I guess only tax benefit remains to justify the investment. I'm really confused about tax benefits/deductions aspect of this. Section 80C, Section 24, Section 80EE and any other. What about capital gains? How much potential tax saving am I looking at (assuming current tax regime remains stable with increases proportionate to inflation)? 

What am I missing? What factors have I overestimated or underestimated or not considered that one must while making real estate investment? Is there a guide on r/IndiaInvestments about this that I have missed? How do I calculate the rate of appreciation needed to justify this as an investment (i.e. beat inflation)?

I understand that the 2008 financial crisis played a pivotal role in these results.

Now my question is should I go with large cap funds or mid cap funds or small cap? I want to maximize returns and don't plan on withdrawing money. I also feel it would be great if we can have a more comprehensive discussion on which cap makes sense and weigh its pros and cons. ";9553;Small cap or mid cap or large cap for a 10 year horizon?;

randiathrowaway0691;1523895618;8corhe;;20;;17;"Lots of times investors only look at specific funds and compare against peer and benchmarks before deciding where to invest. Most will just invest in whatever fund has made good money in the last year, some look for a star manager and only a few will actually try to look at the returns of past 5 years or more before making a decision.

Yet, a lot of old timers here seem to have specific preferred fund houses over actual funds or managers. For example, I have read people say they prefer Franklin because of investment style. Other here recommend PPFAS, Franklin or Quantum for getting advice (and no others). Even though PPFAS fund has only been in existence since 2013 (and their star founder is dead). Quantum is also a very niche fund house and certainly not a top returns.

People are also slightly mistrustful of ICICI, HDFC and other big names. Basically, when I hear that ICICI stewardship is questionable, L&amp;T has not managed Fidelity funds well (though returns are pretty good!) or that Franklin is more trustworthy, I want to know why? Why do you think so?

One should always correctly report their incomes, and pay proper taxes as mandated under Income Tax act.

But this goes beyond that.

Most of you must have heard it by now, ITR-1 would be asking various details of annual income breakdown, as reported in Form-16.

Earlier, up to AY2017-18, form-16 wasn't mandatory for tax filing. But from this year on, it would be.

Also to be noted, that any claims of tax deduction would be viewed as an attempt to under-report taxable income; especially if Form-16 doesn't have it.

Say, your HR asked you to submit IT declaration proofs in January or February, but you waited to complete your ELSS until March end.

Then your form-16 would have the 80C ELSS part missing.

Same goes for people who claim preventive health check-up fee of 5k u/s 80D, or HRA.

I personally know people who work at companies where HR departments are so anal about it, they usually reject HRA exemptions, despite employees filing HRA claims, with signed rent receipts. 

Sometimes it's for rent agreement not properly done, or even employee screwing up the Assessment Year (most people can get confused about FY and AY, especially the last minute rush in filing).

These kind of things, if claimed during filing, could potentially raise eyebrows in the IT department checks.

At any rate, your 26AS would have total salary information from your employer(s).

&gt;Goldman Sachs asks in biotech research report: 'Is curing patients a sustainable business model?'; Goldman Sachs warns biotech clients that curing patients may not be 'sustainable'; Goldman Sachs Says Curing Diseases May Not Be Economically Viable; Financial giant questions if curing diseases is bad for business.

&gt;Here's what the Wall Street banks' biotech report titled 'The Genome Revolution', shared with its investment clients, said: *'The potential to deliver 'one shot cures' is one of the most attractive aspects of gene therapy, genetically-engineered cell therapy and gene editing. However, such treatments offer a very different outlook with regard to recurring revenue versus chronic therapies. While this proposition carries tremendous value for patients and society, it could represent a challenge for genome medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow.'*

&gt;The report then goes on to discuss the example of an American company called Gilead Sciences, whose treatment of the deadly disease Hepatitis C has cure rates in excess of 90 per cent. Goldman Sachs points out that Gilead's US revenues hit a high of $12.5 billion in 2015 and have since fallen to less than a third of that. In fact, it points out an even bigger problem with such an effective medicine: ...*the success of its hepatitis C franchise has gradually exhausted the available pool of treatable patients ...In the case of infectious diseases such as hepatitis C, curing existing patients also decreases the number of carriers able to transmit the virus to new patients, thus the incident pool also declines*.

&gt;**Do you understand the implications? Curing diseases is bad for businesses, and curing infectious diseases is doubly bad because cured patients don't infect others and create more patients.** The implication is clear, and I don't really need to spell it out.

&gt;There is an inevitable and unavoidable crisis when you combine healthcare with returns-on-investment driven business. A few months ago, when the dengue 'treatment' provided by Fortis Hospital to a child was in the headlines, I had written about this issue. At the time, I'd written that I did not know anyone, literally anyone, who was not of the firm belief that there is a huge moral and ethical crisis in the way private hospitals are run in India. Hospitals are in the business of taking as much money as possible from their customers. That's roughly true of any business. The problem with hospitals is that--unlike other businesses--they get customers who suffer from a severe information disadvantage, are often facing an emergency situation, and are generally not capable--at that point--of going to an alternative, competitive provider. **A hospital customer in India now has more in common with a kidnapped victim than the customer of a business.**

&gt;This crisis has perpetrated in all aspects of healthcare, even though it's at its most severe in hospitals. So many of us firmly believe that goods and services provided by private enterprises are intrinsically superior and good for the customer.

I was under the impression that this does not hold true for Indian markets, perhaps because of greater information asymmetry or some other reason. My presumption was reinforced by comparing the performance of index funds and active funds in the last 5-10 years, with most of the index funds being relegated to the bottom quartile.

Sorry for so many vague questions, but basically I have no idea about where to start.";9739;Starting my own business;
Mehuleo;1524728899;8f0xa2;;96;;35;"I am Mehul, founder of [PaisaSavvy.com.](https://www.paisasavvy.com/#!/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=IndiaInvestments&amp;utm_campaign=feedback)

We started PaisaSavvy with the goal to help Indian youngsters save more. We would like to take this opportunity to introduce our venture and take your feedback.

###The Pain

The idea stemmed from a personal pain point that me, my friends and my colleagues faced. For the first few years of my professional career, despite having a steady income I always found my savings close to zero. Though, I've come a long way, done few certified financial courses and helped create wealth for me and my friends, everybody won't have such time.  
And while years had passed, I realized my younger colleagues who had just graduated or were into 2-3 years of jobs were in the same situation as I was once.


###Savings, on paper!

Saving is not that hard, let's see a simple calculation — if one invests just Rs.5,000 / month, in last 4 years he/she would've had around Rs.5,00,000, given 19% Nifty return between 2013-2017. While this amount would be just Rs.3,00,000 in bank FD/RD.


###Savings, in real life!

This sounds easy, but it takes a lot of time to research and analyze the various investment options. For me, even though I've been doing few profitable equity investments here and there, I never had time for consistent research and monitoring due to a full-time job. **And most importantly I didn't always have that exact Rs. 5,000 every month, many months I end up spending all money and I kind of come short a few months.** So, mostly my money used to lay there in a savings account.  

This motivated us to start Paisasavvy, a simpler approach to savings and investments.


###How PaisaSavvy Does it

**Step 1:** You open the [PaisaSavvy](https://www.paisasavvy.com/#!/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=IndiaInvestments&amp;utm_campaign=feedback) **Smart Savings Account** which is like your savings bank account and you deposit your salary into this account. And it gives 6% annual return.  

**Step 2:** You spend your money via debit card, ATM, and online payments as you do with your normal bank account.  

**Step 3:** When your new salary comes, at the end of the month we **Auto-Invest** your surplus amount into various options like Equity, Gold, Bonds, etc based on your risk profile while keeping 20% cash/liquid for the emergency.  

**Step 4:** Sweep-in! Just like regular sweep-in account whenever you empty out your liquid money, our system automatically **Sweep-In** some amount from your investments. So you can spend care-free.

&amp;nbsp;

We will appreciate a lot if you could share your suggestions and feedback to make this product more useful for youngsters.

Vidya Bala

When there is a trend to the behavioral pattern of our investors, we like to understand it. The current trend we are observing in our investors and many around us is that people are liquidating their land or property, or showing intent to do so.

I want to summarize the top reasons I came across for people to sell their land or property in the
past year or so.

Why are people selling real estate now?

Regulatory changes and price stagnation: For those who bought a property for investment, the fear that demonetization and GST could turn their property prices unattractive has led to some selling their second homes or their land holdings.

That real estate prices did not move much in most pockets is true. Data from real estate consulting firm, Jones Lang Laselle, shows prices of residential properties have moved nowhere in the past 3 years. Investors seem to have woken up to the fact that their investment was not yielding much and that the lack of ‘cash transactions’ could push prices down further. This led them to liquidate their real estate asset. This is especially where it is held as plots.

Tax changes and the impact on let out property: Budget 2017 put an end to the good days of booking unlimited losses on your let-out property. With the Rs 2 lakh-per- year-cap on claiming loss from house property (from no limit earlier), the tax-saving component has significantly come down. While the losses can be carried forward for 8 years, it is possible to claim such losses only if your rental income steeply increases to set off this loss. This is because you must be able to generate sufficient surplus under this head of income in subsequent years to set off this loss.

You might want to read an article that we wrote soon after the budget in 2017 on why borrowing
and investing in property is unattractive. The poor rental yields on properties combined with this
loss of tax benefit appear to be slowly triggering an exit from property investment.

Soaring aspirations of the Y2K babies: From a time when going abroad to do a masters was the ‘in’ thing, it is now about packing bags to a foreign land after Class 12. Hence, the baby boomers of the late 90s and early 2000s are now dealing with the increasing aspirations of their high school children to study in destinations such as US, UK, Australia, or Canada for undergraduate studies. And this does not come cheap – ranging from $30,000 per annum to $ 75,000 per annum (and the higher end is for subjects like fine arts in top colleges!).

Indian parents do not appear prepared for this kind of expense. This has meant dealing with huge outgo and providing collaterals for any loans. For those with a second home or property, it provides the cue to sell the real estate to fund the education.

Increasing investment in other assets: Even as real estate has remained a sluggish performer for the past few years, other options including equity, mutual funds and alternative investments have picked up. Data, at least that of ultra HNIs, suggests that high net worth individuals are shedding real estate as an investment option and instead preferring other assets. Ultra HNIs reduced exposure to real estate from 32% in FY-17 to 26% in first half of FY-18. They increased in equity and alternative assets. While we do not have data on retail investors’ behavior, the RBI data suggests that physical savings by households has been on the decrease since FY-12.

What are they doing after selling real estate?

Both the RBI data and the survey on HNIs tell us that people are moving to other asset classes. That is, if they are not using the money towards aspiration like education of children.

We too have seen people realizing the need to diversify after the not-so-good experience with real estate prices in the past few years. But what exactly has our experience been with investors who sold their real estate?

People pose the following questions:
I have money from sale of real estate. Should I pay taxes or reinvest in another property? Is it a good time to invest again?

Should I save capital gains tax by investing in Capital Gains Bonds?

Should I pay taxes and invest in mutual funds?

(A few others who have used up the money their children’s education, of course, ask us how to save for their retirement)

The answer to questions 2 &amp; 3 is easier than question 1. Simple calculation will tell you that you that a 5.75% capital gains bond locked for 5 years will give you 3.95% annualized return after considering tax on interest (yes interest on capital gains bonds is indeed taxable!) at the 30% slab. That is far lower than returns from paying taxes and investing in mutual funds.

So, the answer is simple. You don’t lock into capital gains bonds for the sake of avoiding capital gains tax. You don’t really save any tax.

To answer question 1, we need to understand why you wish to buy real estate. Is it for investment? Or did you just sell the only property you had and are looking to buy one for self-occupation? If you intend to occupy then the economics of affording an EMI (if you must take a loan as well) and other considerations kick in.

If it is for investment, you need to be aware that return on investment (rental yield) is low and that the tax benefit of interest on home loan is significantly reduced.

Diversify!

Some asset classes break our notions of their safety a bit late. Gold, post 2012, is a classic demonstration of asset volatility and poor returns. Real estate too has shown that and more importantly proved its true illiquid nature in a down market, especially post demonetization. Demonetization itself has proved that the king with the cash can become a pauper overnight. Bank scams and NPAs provide some fear of safety of deposits.

Equity, thankfully has always demonstrated sufficient volatility and not hidden its true nature of being risky in the short term. If this is not enough indication to highlight the importance of diversification, then what is?";9877;Why people are exiting their real estate investments[FundsIndia];

Our clients had severe difficulties logging into Kite web &amp; mobile post 9.03 AM today. It took almost two hours for the issues to be resolved. Clients who were logged in from before and those using our desktop applications were not significantly affected. But considering that most of our clients use Kite and login around 9 AM, today was one of the toughest days we have had as a business. 

The issue was primarily due to leased line connectivity between our data centres in Mumbai. We suspect Metro digging work reason for multiple of our primary and backup lines to ""flap"" (as this had affected other services in the past several weeks). Flapping is when leased lines don't completely fail and hence don't automatically switch to the backup lines.

Every day over 2 million trades are executed through us. Even the largest retail brokerages in the US execute just around half of this. At the scale we are at, these infrastructure issues we face in India can have a snowball effect on the trading platform like it did today. Unfortunately, since the lines flapped during market opening, over 3.5 lakh clients constantly tried to log into Kite multiple times causing the login system to build a massive queue of login requests over the already flapping leased lines. The scale of this issue was unprecedented, as you now know.

Having multiple primary and backup modes of connectivity still did not help today. The only permanent solution for issues related to login is to completely remove such over-the-network dependencies between data centres. To this end, we're rebuilding how the Kite login system works completely. This will also have the added benefit of doing away with the current 2FA security questions in favour of a simpler numeric PIN-based system.

This should prevent the particular network failure scenario that happened today in the future, in addition to improving your login experience.

I am aware that a ""sorry"" won't help, even so, I am extremely sorry for the downtime today. We as a team are constantly working to ensure that we can offer the best trading platforms to you.

Again, we deeply regret the pain caused.

&gt;Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has allowed stock exchanges to extend timing of equity derivatives trading till 11:55 pm with effect from October 1, 2018.

&gt;The move is aimed to enable integration of trading of various segments of securities market at the level of exchanges, Sebi said. Trading in equity derivatives will take place from 9:00 am to 11:55 pm, similar to the trading hours for commodity derivatives segment which are presently fixed between 10:00 am and 11:55 pm starting October.

[Sebi announces additional risk management measures for derivatives segment](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-announces-additional-risk-management-measures-for-derivatives-segment/articleshow/64005541.cms)

&gt;These measures pertain to margin collection requirement and computation of liquid net worth for the equity derivatives segment. The provisions of the circular will be effective from June 1.

&gt;With regards to client's margin collection requirement in the equity derivatives segment, SEBI said that clearing members or trading members should include initial margin, exposure margin or extreme loss margin, calendar spread margin and mark to market settlements. Client margins are required to be compulsorily collected and reported to exchange or clearing corporation.

&gt;This is likely to have a negative impact on option writers and traditional brokers. The initial margin required for the positions is computed using a software called SPAN (Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk). SPAN margin covers almost of the risk for of the day.

TyzV9M7Wj;1526139208;8iwrco;;0;;1;"Hi. Due to personal reasons, I wasn't able to file taxes until now. When I contacted a CA, I was told that the last date for Individual filing was over on March 31st.

How deep in trouble am I? I have quite a bit of money submitted through TDS from a contractor which I should be getting as refund ideally. My questions for any of the CAs here are:

1. Can I still file taxes as an individual through a CA?
2. Would I still be eligible for this TDS refund?
3. How much would be the late filing penalty, if any? I come under 5&amp;#37; bracket.
4. How much would a CA charge \(average price\) me if I were to consult him for filling?

Need some advice on buying a piece of land in Pune. Budget is around 20-21L and aiming somewhere around 3000sq ft. 

I can manage a down payment of 10-15L through family savings and my personal savings. Is it possible to get a loan on the remaining amount? 

I dont intend to stay in the plot but will do necessary minimum construction needed on it to demarcate it and create a small garden and hire someone old to stay there and take care of it if needed and basically avoid encroachment. As I save up over the years, I will slowly construct over the property as needed. 

Reasons I dont like buying an apartment even though its a lot easier to get a loan on it. 

* Lived in a plot all my life where there is free space around to move and independence in general

* I just personally dont like the apartment system of living. This is aimed for parents who are of the same mindset and since this is for them to get old somewhere.

I didn't give any target for the scrip but it is better to ride the growth till the company reaches the asset\-based value of 162 per share\(or 150 that's a 50&amp;#37; increase\) and after that, I'm a skeptic. The company can grow more but I'm not comfortable with that unless the balance sheet also sees growth too.

How safe are liquid funds in case of market downcycles/crashes?    



 From last 2 days I am toying with the following idea : Keep emergency fund of about 6 month expenditure in bank account and over next few years build liquid fund corpus of about 4-5 years of expenditure. After that use funds from market for everyday expenses if market is performing good but in case of market crash or bad days use liquid funds. 
  

However for this to work, few assumptions should be correct:

 1) liquid funds are safe and real returns are zero after inflation if I am withdrawing after 3 years  and . 

 2) when market crashes then generally market recovers in 4-5 years.

ffxqtslk;1527052645;8lgujv;;10;;10;"Hi all,

I have been thinking about this for a while. I have a fairly diversified portfolio of mutual funds that I invest (via MFU CART facility) ever month. 

There is an asset allocation that I stick to so that every month when I invest, I invest that cash so as to keep the portfolio on track as per the target asset allocation as much as possible. Basically if my target allocation is 20:50:30 and my current is 21:49:30, when I add this month's investment,  I do it to get the portfolio as close to 20:50:30 as possible minimising sells and triggering capital gains.

I have been looking at the current NAV/52wHighNAV ratio of my funds and this tells me how close these funds are to their 52 week highs. The actual metric I use is (NAV-52wLow)/average(52wHigh,52wLow).

Is there any tangible benefit in

* Deviate from the strategic allocation target by tactically under weighting funds very close to the 52w high

* Over weighting the same amount in funds very close to the 52w low.

I understand this increases trading costs (capital gains, exit loads).

As of this moment, I have not back tested this strategy and so do not have the numbers to back it up and hence wanted to get the gut-feel responses from the community.

NeverSeenBoobs;1527650111;8n5aij;;0;;1;"Hi, I have an investment dilemma. My father has retired from his service and has around Rs. 45.00 L at his disposal. It's currently in his Savings a/c. I wanted him to invest in various modes for post retirement purpose. However he has desired a wish to buy a new house in Mumbai for around Rs. 2.00 Cr. +/- 20.00 L
So, the current financial scenario is-
Inflow - Rs. 30,000 (Father's current new job) + Rs. 60,000 (Mother's job) = Rs. 90,000

Outflow - Rs. 45,000 (Rent) + Rs. 45,000 (Household expenses) = Rs. 90,000

Apart from his retirement funds of Rs. 45.00 L, 1.55 Cr required for purchasing a new house is available via another house and shares. So there'll be very little or no component of loan.
My doubt is how should I go about for investing his Rs. 45.00 L assuming I'll need it in say within 2-3 years.
Also he has around Rs. 10.00 L lying in Savings a/c [lack of financial knowledge].
So he has around Rs. 55.00 L to invest in some short term fund.

My mother has estimated that she'll get around Rs. 55.00 L on her retirement, which she intends to use for post retirement needs and expenses.

I am planning to consult a financial planner for the same since I don't want to take risk with the money. So I'm throwing this question to you guys so that I don't just agree to whatever the financial planner advises.

modgill;1527929159;8nzbhc;OPINION;28;;20;"So. Let's look at your folio return for the month of May. Midcap nifty 100 was down roughly 7 percent in last 30 days. And Smallcap nifty 100 down 6.90 percent in last 30 days.

My folio was down 7.6 percent in May. Even though my folio consists of 30 percent large caps, 50 percent midcap and 20 percent smallcaps.

What is happening according to me is what happened on January to march 2016. Where smallcap and midcap indexes lost between 20 to 25 percent. Similarly after demonitization smallcaps and midcaps suffered 15 to 20 percent falls. And a very similar falls from January 2013 to June 2013, roughly from 15 to 20 percent.

Big fund houses generally start booking profits and shifting about once in a while. A clue I found is. That during last 6 months, my folio is down 10 percent but my Mutual funds of small and midcaps are up anywhere between 5 to 9 percent.

The selling pressure we see is panic selling right now. Stocks which have great value falling like nine pins. Example, Rain Industries, avanti feeds, REC, PFC, tinplate, bhel, capital first. All these companies have good fundamentals and profits. But still got battered in last 6 months. Most of them down 50 percent from Peak values. 

There are many others too but there are just too many to name here. 

Go and see charts of smallcap and midcap index. Everytime there was a fall, nifty mostly stayed stable. And same is the case this time. 

We are almost or about to reach the bottoms in midcap and smallcaps in next 10 to 15 days. 

I think now or within this month would be a great time to start a midcaps SIP and start buying stocks in staggered manner. 

Remember, blood is in the street, panic is everywhere, selling pressure is insane. 

Obituaries are being written on valuepickr, geniuses have come out from the closet explaining why the midcap and smallcap slaughter is happening and were bullish 1 year ago. 

Make no mistake, fear has taken over the smaller stocks or midcaps. And whenever I start seeing tributes and obituaries being written and analysts shouting to sell the smallcaps, I know. What I'm going to do.

3.Giving loans at high rates to their own companies though the company could borrow at lower rates.

iheartsubmariner;1528050610;8oakhu;;27;;27;"My parents, who put me on this LIC policy are being complete brick walls when I talk about how this is a HORRIBLE policy to have on my portfolio.

Policy details:

Plan: Jeevan Anand (149)
Commencement date: 23/5/13
Sum Assured: Rs. 50,00,000
Accident bonus: Rs. 5,00,000
Term: 25 years
Premium: 185700 p.a.
Maturity: 5/38

I wasn't in India when they got me onto this plan, so I had no say at the time. I am 23 now.

I have paid the premiums till 2017, and I really want to surrender this policy now. However, is it better to make it paid up?

The worst part is that the agent who put me on this plan is my father's friend and as I've seen, he's really just a leech gobbling up commissions.

I used a really low interest rate, i.e. 10% to show that in 25 years investments in equity would far outperform ""investments"" in LIC's Jeevan Anand. However when they asked me to show what would happen if I invested in equities from now till the maturity date of the insurance policy, then the result was a lower return - continuing with LIC would net me ~1.33cr in 5/38, while an Equity MF would net me ~1.23cr, at 10% p.a. with a principal amount of 1,87,500 invested yearly.

Then I explained that I was using a very conservative estimate, and that increasing the interest rate to 11% would match LIC's returns, however the reply I got was that ""both calculations use assumptions, and either one could be right"". Explaining that on average equities outperform everything in the long term, and showing graphs was of no use.

I used freefincal's spreadsheet calculator to determine whether it made sense to go paid up or surrender, and I got a value between 7 and 8%, assuming that the bonuses are going to be decent (I used 49 in column E, based on a declared bonus of 2,45,000 I found on an online calculator).

The big emotional deterrent seems to be the fact that surrendering the policy means losing a few lakhs of the premiums paid. Getting my father past the sunk cost fallacy is proving to be very difficult.

I've sent the advisor an email to give me the paid-up and surrender values for the next five years, i.e. from 2018 to 2022. Let's see what data he gives me.

The offer I've gotten from my mom is that my dad will pay the remaining premiums from his pocket while I can invest as I please. But I'm worried this will affect my ability to get a decent term life insurance in the future when I actually need it, and I want to get my dad on a term life insurance now because I am not fully financially independent and we have major planned expenses to take care of right now, as well as those that are coming up in the next few years. His own life insurance portfolio is a graveyard of reduced paid up policies that when combined have less coverage than even the policy covering me right now. It's barely enough to pay for a half a year of my brother's college tuition, let alone living expenses. My mother has an even worse coverage.

I'm not even aware of how many pots he has placed his money in, and he never discusses them with me, the only person in the family even remotely interested in managing our finances systematically. Hell, I doubt even he is aware of all the places he has dumped money like this, and I'm not even getting into his real estate investments, which is a discussion for another time.

**User profile**: Age \- 26 Years | Monthly Investment \- INR 10,000 | Investment Horizon \- 3\-5 Years

**Financial Goal**: Receive INR 1 Lakh every year

**Assumption**: You will start investing in 2018

**Risk Profile**: Moderate to High

While I will specifically answer this question, I will detail out the process for the benefit of every reader of the answer.

**Steps for creating a financial plan**:

* **Step 1: Goal Determination**

Writing down a clear, achievable goal is probably the most important step of financial planning.

* **Step 2: Risk Tolerance Assesment**

It's often the neglected aspect of financial planning. Any return is possible. You can even get 1 Cr by just investing INR 1000 in a year. However, the problem is the immense probability of losing your capital. For example, you invest INR 1000 in the online betting website or poker website such as add 52, but in these case, the risk of losing the money is close to 100&amp;#37;.

* **Step 3: Asset Allocation**

Broadly speaking, your investment options are guided by two factors \- investment horizon and risk appetite.

* **Short\-term goals** \(less than a year\): Invest in safe instruments such as bank deposits and company deposits.
* **Medium\-term goals** \(2\-5 years\): Use relatively safer debt schemes such as liquid funds.
* **Long\-term goals** \(5\+ years\): Invest in equity mutual funds or stocks. Go for the latter option only when you have sound knowledge of stock market.

One of the best options for a beginner to investment in are mutual funds because they offer a number of advantages:

* Low minimum amounts
* Diversification
* Paperless investing
* Withdraw anytime \(in most cases\)

To understand the different types of funds, check this detailed [mutual funds investment blog for beginners](https://sqrrl.in/blog/invest-mutual-funds-for-beginners/).

* **Step 4: Mutual Fund Selection**

Selecting the right mutual fund is the most overwhelming task in the entire process. Starts by applying quantitative parameters such as AUM, Market Cap Up, Fund Manager Vintage, Expense Ratio, Exit Load, Portfolio Yield, Credit Quality &amp; Duration History. And after putting over schemes into this funnel, shortlist the ones that match your financial objectives.

* **Step 5: Portfolio Review**

While you shouldn't be worried by daily ups and downs of your investment value, you should, however, track your investment on a regular basis in order to make intelligent changes. Further, you should make changes in your asset allocation as your risk profile and goal changes.

For example, if your job situation becomes shaky or you come into an inheritance, it might be time to revise the plan.

Generally, people struggle to re\-balance on two accounts:

* **First**, it's psychologically difficult to take money out of asset class or fund that is performing well, and
* **Second**, we are lazy.

However, as past performance isn’t always an indicator of future performance, you should regularly track and make changes in your portfolio in order to adhere to your risk\-return tolerance level. There are a lot of free tools available to check your portfolio status. You can[ free app Sqrrl to track your investment](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.sqrrl.app.sqrrlapi).

**Recommendations for different possible cases:**

As risk tolerance and the number of years you want to receive INR 1 Lakh every year is missing, here are recommendations for different possible cases:

**Case 1: Medium Risk Tolerance**

Assumptions:

* Investment period: 5 years
* Invest in diversified equity mutual funds with a target return of 12&amp;#37; return on an average
* After the 5 years, investment of corpus in low risk in debt fund earning 8&amp;#37; annum

*In this case, you can enjoy INR 1 lakh every year for 13 long years :\)*

Here is a list of top performing diversified equity funds you can invest:

* IDFC Classic Equity Fund \- Reg \- Growth
* Aditya Birla Sun Life Advantage Fund \- Growth
* DSP BlackRock Equity Fund \- Reg \- Growth
* Franklin India Prima Plus \- Growth
* HDFC Equity Fund \- Growth

You can also try [top mid\-small cap funds for a kicker.](https://sqrrl.in/blog/top-mid-small-cap-funds-2018/)

**Case 2: High\-Risk Tolerance**

Assumptions:

* Investment period: 5 years
* Invest in SIP to target return of 15&amp;#37; on an average
* After the 5 years, investment of corpus in low risk in debt fund earning 8&amp;#37; annum

*In this case, you can enjoy INR 1 lakh every year for 16 long years :\)*

Here is a list of SIP with the 1\-year return as on April 2018 where you can invest:

* SBI Emerging Business Fund \- Growth: 19.43&amp;#37;
* Axis Midcap Fund \- Growth: 19.38&amp;#37;
* SBI Magnum Global Fund 94 \- Growth: 15.33&amp;#37;

**Case 3: General retirement planning**

Assumptions:

* Investment period: 24 years \(from 26 years to 50 years\)
* Invest in diverse asset classes with a mix of equity and debt \(high weightage of equity \) to target return of 12&amp;#37; on an average
* After the 26 years, investment of corpus in extremely low risk in debt fund earning 5&amp;#37; annum

*In this case, you can enjoy* ***INR 1 lakh every month*** *for 29 long years :\)*

In general, my suggestion for you will be – don't chase huge returns. You might end up losing your own money. As retirement age approaches, investment portfolios tend to incline towards more conservative investments, like bonds and money market funds, to better safeguard the nest egg.

This is my previous post that I'm referring to. I started my SIP 2 years ago and continued it till today.

Initially I planned to continue with it for 3 years. But now after 2 years, the returns that I was getting was lower compared to what I would have got from FD everything considered, so I cancelled the SIP.

I kept track of SIP, and continued with it previously considering the market condition during and after demonetization. After demonetization, performance of the funds improved but then stayed the same and didn't improved further.

Going forward, I have 2 possibilities that I'm considering and would appreciate your help zeroing on one. My preference is good returns and can take risk for it. I have savings as well as money that I'll be getting from the SIP. So, options:

1. I can invest in different funds this time, repeat the same as earlier and check back again after a few years.

2. I can put money in stocks, but I have no knowledge of it. I'm ready to take risks and put time in learning.

If there's any other option that I should look into please suggest.

Not sure about the rules of the subreddit and whether posts like this are more suitable for the stickied discussion but i'll wait and see if the mods pull this down.

Anyway just like most of the people on this sub I like the idea of ETFs - 

i)Alpha generation has been hard over the past years and its hard to find fund managers who beat the market

ii)Low expense ratio   

My only worry is that does the low volume of trade.

Does this make redemption harder due to the lack of buyers when we talk about larger redemptions( 15 - 25L rupees )

Dont really have a immediate use for the money and can leave it invested for 10+ years.
Do i just invest in ETFs and hope India will see an influx of passive investors in the coming years or do I just go ahead with a regualr index fund ?";10675;Low volume an issue for ETFs ?;

While I hate government interference in anything – there is an argument to be made that in a country with such widespread financial illiteracy and so ill-prepared for retirement – increasing the component of PPF is a good thing.


Equally there’s a good opposing argument to be made that force without financial education is no point. Since people will likely withdraw their PPF and spend it on conspicuous consumption items like children’s wedding etc and the retirement scenario will not change. Also – India has an extremely high Household savings rate % already – just that the money is deployed for other goals.


Thoughts?

1InRepair1;1529236074;8rqiu1;OPINION;0;;1;"Hi everyone,

I would really like your advice with some of my financials. 

First, about me.

I'm a 26 year old salaried individual working for a pharmaceutical MNC for the past 2 years, with a current package of 4 LPA. My take home, in hand per month is 29,500 Rs.

I currently live with my parents and I have been investing money (very small amounts in SIPs since I have got this package very recently) in mutual funds as well as a few shares.

With my first year or so of saving, I was able to make the down payment and purchase a motorcycle for myself which helped with transportation to work and other stuff. The remaining amount was financed through an auto loan from Bajaj Auto Finance. The loan is valid for 3 years and I am paying 3457 Rs per month. Currently, the closing principle is 78,269 Rs.

Simultaneously, I have managed to make about average to below-average returns overall (6.18&amp;#37; in Aditya Birla Sunlife Frontline Equity and 4.65&amp;#37; in SBI Bluechip Fund, around 9&amp;#37; total in my shares). Including all my holdings, I now have an amount of 76,684 if I sell everything in my portfolio.

This will help me clear my auto loan completely.

The question is, do I sell everything and pay off my auto loan first and re-enter the market from scratch? Or let the loan continue and manage my investments simultaneously and let the corpus grow?

Currently, as things stand with the loan, if I continue the same until the end of the tenure, I will have to pay 21,119 in interest (interest rate 11.75&amp;#37;). At the same time, my returns on my investment has been meager for now but I hope that the mutual funds will do better in the future.

I have no major financial constraints, I help with house finances and pay for my own stuff independantly.

Also, my long term goal is to purchase my own house within the next 5 years, can you give me some investment options/strategy so that I can achieve this? I expect to be earning somewhere around 8-10LPA within the next 5 years at my current career growth rate as well as looking at the industry and the payscales.

Now the course fees is quite hefty, around 96 lacs, for which I've decided to take a loan *(I know this is quite a lot, but people already in this industry have advised me to go ahead with the loan. One tends to pay back in full after working for a couple of years)*. 

There are various nationalised banks, which I know will give the loan quite easily against a collateral of that value, but I need someone who can guide me as to how to negotiate the loan terms.

watterott;1529297729;8rwwbv;;0;;1;"So, my grandfather was a share market enthusiast. My earliest (and strongest) memory of him was overhearing phone conversations of him discussing shares with friends (as a kid I thought he was buying and selling 'lions' -- 'shers'). My dad on the other hand showed no interest in equity. I guess the interest skips a generation. 

Now, my grandfather died in 1999 and it appears there is no record of his shares with us. I guess he would have had physical shares at that time (?). The other day my dad mentioned that they still keep getting letters of unclaimed dividends that he's never paid attention to. This obviously got me excited. What is he purchased some Infy share :)

Yesterday we received a letter of unclaimed dividend from Tata Global Beverages. I'm planning to write to the company to get more details about the shares he owned. I had a couple of question from you all:

* I was reading that if dividend is unclaimed for more than 7 years, that the dividend and shares are transferred to an investor education fund. My grandfather died more than 19 years ago. How can he still be receiving dividends?
* Since the shares were likely physical and lost, is there any way I can find out which shares he owned?

To be fair, the Kuvera app has lots of issues, and not as good as the website. And someone should call them out on it. There are lot of reviews on play store, that points out these issues.

But to do that to promote your own app, has lasting consequences. Google seems to have removed most of these reviews, but **their rating has come down from 4.3 to 3.8**.

ProBow;1529447518;8sd5ee;;0;;0;"Elevate Group has just launched their new BTC Mining Service this last month. Not a cloud Mining operation, but a straight investment-management agreement. You buy an ASIC Miner and ElevateGroup manages it for you. Their mission is to become the most transparent and most profitable mining operation on the market , and to give the investors a real opportunity to get involved in commercial Bitcoin Mining.

Two experienced groups (Baikal Mining and Amir Ness) came together to create this project. They own a 20 Million Dollar, 10 Megawatt facility in Irkutsk, Russia. Its also a short drive away from the new Bitmain Repair center .

This is not their first BTC Mining operation, Baikal Mining is well seasoned in this field as is Amir Ness. They know that other profit sharing BTC Mining operations (Ambit Mining, Ice Rock, Miner one, etc.) take huge fees up front and don't mention a word about it, up to 35% of your investment before it ever sees contribution to the project. Elevate Group keeps a 5% initial fee (lowest you can find), which makes mining up to 30% more profitable just by working with ElevateGroup.

Access to Electricity @ five and a half cents per KWH (.055)

Your ASIC is on a livestream 24/7 and allows you to see how it is performing, its earnings, its hashrate, everything.

Elevate Group launched without tokenizing the project, meaning no ICO. This means no ICO regulations to keep people from investing. They do a straight investment-management agreement and give you monthly payouts from 80% of the profit pool. Most mining operations distribute payouts from around 50% of the pool.

Elevate saw an opportunity to make Mining more attractive by being aggressively competitive with their pricing. You won't find lower fees. Give them a look, its worth some due diligence.

And it'll take ~1 month for the transfer. I told them that I won't be in India by then. So, they told me I can authorize my dad to collect the money when the account is transferred. They told me to write the money handover authorization on the back of each of the certificate and sign it. I did that and left all the certificates with my dad. I came back to USA. 

And then the post office started dilly-dallying. Every 2-3 week, my dad visited the post office and they kept saying ""Bangalore post office isn't responding to our transfer request, we are following up with them."" Then almost a year after the process had started, they finally said that the account is transferred and the check can be collected. But now they said that the check will be drawn in my name, and not in the name of my dad...!! I don't have any active bank account in my hometown. I have one account which has gone dormant because of inactivity. We said, fine, we'll deposit the check there and get it activated once I go back to India sometime next year.

Company A offers a 8% return with AAA NDC investments(make up 85% of the investments) and 15% gsec.

Option 1 is an HDFC scheme whose SID states they will invest about 85% in NDCs and the rest in Government sector bonds. 

Option 2 is IDFC scheme which says the same.

Vehicle Details:
 Bike  - Bajaj Pulsar NS200
 Date of Buying - 28 June 2017 - (So this is just one year old)

Confusion is since Reliance is cheaper and giving me high valuation but the repute of company like Baja Alliance  and their offer of Roadside assistance is creating all confusion between two options.

Primary Questions I have
1. Out of the two in which case it will be better, easier and sooner to claim the policy in case of any mishap with me or vehicle?
2. Does a promise of roadside assistance by an insurance company like Bajaj Allianz should be considered so good that 5k of valuation should be compromised?
3. Is there any third option I have which is better than these two in both terms (ease to claim and valuation)

Disclaimer: Apologies if the post is against the rules or not relevant. If so, please feel free to ignore. 

I'm not looking for advice on a residential property as an investment. I've already made up my mind on that front. I'm looking for info from people who've been through the home loan process and could help me out.

About me:

Age: 31
Cibil score: 790 
Salaried individual (cibil showing incorrect as self employed, I was self employed from 2011-2013, will dispute and correct)
CTC for fy 17-18: 60L (10% variable, 90 fixed)
CTC for fy 16-17: 50L
Outstanding credit card amount: 338816 (will clear more than 50% next week)

Loan requirement: 1.65 cr (after down payment)
Caveats: need to have my mother/father as co borrower
Co borrower will make 20% down payment for the property
EMI expectation: willing to pay 2L pm, out of which 50k to be paid by co borrower.

Questions:
1. How likely am I to get the loan?
2. I've spoken to banker for pre approval, just need to give my docs.  Should I go ahead or is there a chance to improve cibil first?
3. How bad does it impact my chances if pre approval doesn't happen and then I try again elsewhere?

Thanks in advance. I did Google what I could but not much help besides ""all ok if cibil above 750""

jharna4039;1530031080;8u1hr4;;0;;1;"Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP) is a service offered by insurance companies. It has an extra benefit like a pure insurance policy. It gives investors both insurance and investment under a single integrated plan. Let’s assume, if you are giving Rs.100/- as a premium then 40% money goes to insurance and the rest 60% is invested according to your choice either in equity-oriented funds or debt-oriented funds. ULIPs have a lock-in period of five years unlike the ELSS mutual Fund of 3 years. The policyholder is permitted to make a partial withdrawal after this period. The partial withdrawal should not exceed 20% of the fund value of the policy. ULIPs are completely tax-free if you withdraw the money after the lock-in period of 5 years.

It is not only an insurance policy but also covers risk for the policyholder along with investment gateway in many asset classes like stocks, Mutual Funds, debt instruments, Corporate bonds, Government securities etc. If an investor has a low-risk profile and an investment horizon of 5 years investing in ULIPs with major portion in stocks is not a good idea. Similarly, an investor with longer investment horizon and high-risk appetite should go for equity-oriented ULIPs that make bigger exposure to equities. You can choose ULIP investments to plan for significant milestones like marriage, home purchase, education or marriage of your children.
The ULIP offers choices to invest either in equity, Debt Instruments or Government Securities. ULIP provides two types of investment option and they are

Fixed Portfolio Strategy: Option to allocate your savings in the funds of your choice i.e., Equity oriented fund, Debt Oriented Fund etc. If you opt for equity oriented fund 80% of your money is invested in stocks. If you opt for debt-oriented fund 80% of your money is invested in corporate bonds or government securities.

Lifecycle based Portfolio Strategy: A unique and personalized strategy to create an ideal balance between equity and debt, based on your age. If you are a young person then 65% money is invested in equity or stocks and the rest 35% money is invested in debt instruments. According to your age, this portfolio may be changed. At the age of 55, 80% of your money is invested in debt instruments and the rest 20% is invested in equity or stocks.

Here are the basic three common fund options:

Equity Oriented Fund: If you want to invest Rs. 100/- then this type of fund allows you to invest minimum 80% and maximum 100% in equity or stocks.
Debt/Income Oriented Fund: If you want to invest Rs. 100/- then this type of fund allows you to invest minimum 80% and maximum 100% in debt Instruments i.e. Bonds, Government Securities.

Multi-cap Balanced Fund: This is a mixture of equity or stocks and debt instruments according to your risk appetite. If you want to invest Rs.100/- this type of fund allows you to invest minimum 0% and a maximum of 60% in equities and minimum 20% and a maximum of 70% in Debt Instruments.
The ULIP provides two types of an Insurance policy and they are

Regular Premium: In this type of pay system you can pay your installment on yearly or quarterly or monthly basis. The minimum tenure of this kind of Unit Linked Insurance Plan is 10 years and maximum of 25 years. The minimum age of entry is 20 years and the maximum age of entry is 54 years. The minimum sum assured in this type of ULIP is Higher of (10 X Annual Premium) and (0.5 X Policy term X Annual Premium) if you are on the age group of 20-44 years and Higher of (7 X Annual Premium) and (0.25 X Policy term X Annual Premium) if you are on the age group of 45-54 years.

One time Premium: In this type of pay system you are allowed to pay a one-time premium. The tenure of this kind of ULIP is 10 years. The minimum age of entry is 20 years and the maximum age of entry is 54 years. If you opt this scheme at the age below 35 years then The minimum sum assured in this type of ULIP is Higher of (1.25 X Single Premium) and maximum sum assured is (10 times of Single Premium). If you opt this scheme at the age above 35 years then The minimum sum assured in this type of Unit Linked Insurance Plan is Higher  (1.25 X Single Premium) and maximum sum assured is (1.25 X Single Premium).

The benefit of Unit Linked Insurance plan is that you can get tax benefits up to Rs. 1.5 lakh on your insurance premiums under section 80C. Also, the earnings from your policy and the equity-debt switches are completely tax-free. There are several Indian companies available in this field and they are HDFC Life Click2Invest, ICICI Prudential ULIP Plan.

I have been studying technical analysis for three months now, and I think I have a strategy.

I have backtested the strategy on 11 years of price points for stocks in the NIFTY 50. The strategy seems to work well on longer periods of time (&gt;2 years), does extremely well in bullish markets (75% gain in 2017), and horribly in bearish markets like the current one (-20% since Jan'18). 

But, on longer periods of time, the CAGR seems to considerably beat the NIFTY 50 (20% CAGR for all periods over 3 years with a 20% win ratio on trades). Now, I have a couple of questions,

1. What do I do now? Do I straight away go and try of the strategy in markets?

2. Do I deploy my entire capital of go slow, baby steps?

3. My strategy does not work well in bearish markets, so, should I wait for currently? But, then no body knows when the market is swinging back.

So to the point, this post is just an illustration comparing outright purchases vs interest free credit purchases and deferring the difference to some small low risk investment, when you the money to do either.

A lot of companies offer No cost EMI's,  they are touted as products hoping to change consumer buying habits, to exhibit how easy EMI's are, now you don't have to settle for anything else other than your ""dream"" and everybody is 'special'. Basically it is just conditioning for people who are very debt averse, trying to teach them that not all debt is bad, and hopefully get them into the buy impulsively crowd. Basically take the discipline out of financial disciplines

All that aside, interest free credit should always be pounced upon. If I've made any mistakes or wrong assumptions please do point them out, because I think all of this to be gospel

For a small example, buying a galaxy S8 outright for will cost you 45,990 at flipkart, Check their EMI tab, and you have [no cost emi's](https://imgur.com/a/HvtTO8h) offered by atleast 10 institutions, for instance a nine month EMI of 5,110 per month comes to 45,990, no other costs

In this scenario, I would opt for the EMI option, even if I had the 46,000, and put it in a Debt fund, current rates are 7.5%. So I guess by doing this, [Detailed Calculations](https://imgur.com/a/HvtTO8h), I manage to  

1. Get a 2.5% off on total purchase
2. Maybe get a better CIBIL score because I've had debts which I've cleared promptly?
3. Accumulate some reward points
4. Even if I don't put the money into a fund, it takes away the burden of paying 46k at one shot, making easy monthly payments without any extra charge

I have been reading a lot about debt funds and am currently invested in liquid funds. I know that in a rising rate scenario (not the case now) long term debt funds do well. But after having compared many funds over multiple periods, I have not found a long term debt fund which *convincingly* beats a liquid/US debt fund. 

Hence the question, When do long/medium term debt funds give better returns than liquid/US debt funds? Thanks

moon_shaker;1530599591;8vq0c3;DISCUSSION;3;;17;"BACKGROUND:

 Family of 4. Father was a government official and died in an unfortunate accident while crossing the road a couple of years back. Mother is a home maker and living on husbands pension. Son (Eldest of siblings) is not working and a chronic alcoholic with some of his organs giving up day by day. He might not survive more than 2-3 years from now. Daughter moved to another country after marriage about a decade ago. Daughter is not working and her family is not very well to do, but, living a peaceful middle class life. Daughter is able to visit only once in 2 years due to her financial dependency on the husband.

Communication with mother and son is very bad and do not talk to each other. Son drinks dawn to dusk. Falls down and passes out time by time and mother takes care with no option. Relatives are far from where they stay and friends for help are limited.

PROBLEM:

Father has made some decent amount of money in terms of savings. He had some money locked up in FD's, shares, equities and savings etc. After he sudden and unfortunate demise, all his documents and bank related debit cards etc are being hidden by the son. Even the papers of the only house the family owns is not transferred from the father to the other family member. House documents are hidden by the brother. He is using up all the savings money day by day for his drinking habits using the debit card. He is not revealing on the bank balance or anything till date. Daughter feels very strongly that the balance in the bank runs to a few 10's of lakhs for sure. Mother has started to get some health issues and is unable to pay for all medical bills. She is in need of money. Daughter feels Nominee is her mother on all bank documents.

Recently the father has received few notices from the income tax department. Brother hides all these letters. Mother just could make out that it was from the income tax department but is not educated enough to understand what the letter is all about. One of the letter is about showing proofs to the income tax department on how the house was built.

How should the family go about this problem now ? They just want to make sure nothing is lost with the bank and all the father has made. Mother and daughter want to reply back and does not want to lose time with the income tax department. What is the legal way to transfer the house to the mothers name ? What is the legal way to transfer the savings account, FD's, shares etc to the mothers name ?

I am 31 Freelancer who would like to go to the US for higher studies. I have no physical assets in India and my parents dont have any either. I have savings from my work about 20L, mainly cash in bank and FDs with small amount in mutual funds. 

I am not aiming for a top university or anything, my goal is to be closer to my US citizen fiance so that we can close the distance. We have been to multiple lawyers and this seems to be the safest route for us to close the distance. Fiance and spousal visas are tough for us as we havent got a lot of facetime together (about a month) and neither can she leave her job to come to live in India for a few months where we can get married. Both of our families know and they are onboard with the relationship. 

Due to recent spike in work contracts. I am making a decent amount of money and would like some help in how I can go about using it for my masters. 

With my existing savings, I am earning around 3-5k USD each month on average and my spending my really minimal. I have read and heard from various sources that its always better to get a loan. 

How should I go about doing this? Should I put my money into FDs and get a loan against? I really don intend to use the loan but if it helps my i20 application, that would be awesome. 

Also kinda offtopic but I would like to keep working for my existing clients even if I go to the US. Since they pay straight to my indian bank accounts, is it wrong for me to carry on working cuz the US visa stipulates no or limited work. But I guess that applies to working a normal job in the US and most of my work is done over the internet since I am a developer.

Hello everyone, as the title suggests, seeking some advice regarding my present financial condition. I decided to post this here because [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance) posts always seem to revolve around what one can do in the US and some (or most?) of those options seem to be unavailable in India.

Here's my present financials:

8+ lacs as savings, liquid in bank accounts

2+ lacs in FDs (about 1 lac each in two deposits, both are set to mature this year)

2.2 lacs in mutual funds (present value) with monthly SIPs of 19.5k

1.76 lac invested in stocks currently valued at 1.85

My yearly CTC is about 8 lacs with monthly take home of around 60k. I am presently living at home, so I do not need to pay rent, but I expect to have to move for work in the near future (within 2 months) so I would expect to start paying at least 15k out of that income in rent and utilities.

I have no education loans and no debts. Nor does my family.

I have company provided health insurance with a 3 lac cover (could be 5, not very sure)

In terms of what I have planned in the future, I plan on taking the GRE this year around October to apply for PhD programmes in the US ( I already have a master's degree). Taking into consideration the test and application fees, I expect this to cost around 1.5 lacs. This is for the term starting in fall 2019.

With regards to durable purchases, do not particularly enjoy driving (roads in Kolkata), so no plans on buying a car anytime soon. Have a perfectly functioning laptop and phone, so no expenses on those front for the next two years.

Suffice to say, I am extraordinarily lucky in terms of my present financial condition. Most of the savings figure is attributed to the extremely generous gifts that I have received from my grandparents.

I am seeking advice on two fronts:

1. Investment avenues - with 8 lacs sitting in the bank account, I am losing a lot of money due to the low rate of returns. I have been reading that a market correction is coming soon - is time to up my monthly SIPs? I am usually on the lookout for legit IPOs but I missed HDFC, GIC and Bandhan. Subscribed to RITES, but did not get any shares allocated. My account manager at my bank seems to be hellbent on getting me an ULIP - do you guys have any experience on this and is this a good idea? What about the upcoming ICICI PHD NFO? I have a fairly long term investment appetite, don't mind my money being help up for 10 years (or more).
2. Tax savings - I have already exhausted my 1.5 lac quota of 80(C) with PPF deposits. Hence I am looking to buy a more comprehensive health insurance. Not interested in just cancer and heart cover. Looking for all-encompassing cover. I am a glaucoma suspect, so I would like my eyes to be covered under the scheme - any recommendations (I don't smoke)?

TL;DR: I have a lot of cash sitting in my bank account, how do I invest it? How do I save tax on my 60k-a-month earnings (apart from PPF)? What's a good all-encompassing health insurance cover?

tl;dr, use the PMT formula in LibreOffice/Excel/Google Spreadsheet and get your answer.

# Background: Loan as an account with negative balance

A simple way to understand a loan is as a bank account (or with an NBFC) that has *negative* balance. For example, if you have money in your SBI savings account, SBI pays you 3.5&amp;#37;. If you make FDs, they pay you more. But if you have an account where the bank (or lender) has put money, you *owe* them interest. This interest depends on the type of loan you have taken, but is generally more than the highest fixed deposit return that you could get (since the lender has to make money!).

For this example, let us assume that you have taken a loan of Rs. 10,000, for a tenure of two years and the rate of interest owed is 12&amp;#37; per annum, with monthly computation of interest. This means that the amount owed compounds each month at 1&amp;#37;. We can now create a simple spreadsheet, like this:

|Month|Outstanding|Interest owed at end of month|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0|10,000|100|
|1|10,100|101|
|2|10,201|102.01|
|3|10,303.01|103.03|
|...|...|...|
|24|12,697.35|126.97|

Here, the outstanding at the beginning of the next month is the previous outstanding plus the interest accrued in the month. As you can see, the outstanding keeps growing. To get a handle on this, we need to pay up!

# Reducing what you owe: monthly repayment

Now, we look at what happens if we start paying back some amount every month. Let's add another column called repayment, and assume that the payment occurs at the end of the month. That is, the first payment occurs at the end of the month zero, and the last one occurs at the end of month 23. Let us assume that we pay back Rs. 400 every month. Then, the next month, the entry will be Previous outstanding plus interest minus payment.

|Month|Outstanding|Interest owed at end of month|Payment at end of month|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0|10,000|100|400|
|1|9,700|97|400|
|2|9,397|93.97|400|
|3|9,090.97|90.91|400|
|...|...|...||
|23|2,285.11|22.85|400|
|24|1,907.96|19.08||

Ok, so what happened here? We find that, every month, we have been able to reduce the outstanding. But is it enough? Not fast enough to get it down by month 24. We still have about Rs. 1,900 left, and this can be paid back in 4-5 months. So the tenure of 24 months is not enough to pay down at the rate of Rs. 400 per month; this would be enough to pay down at around 29 months.

We can also try paying down an amount smaller than Rs. 100, say Rs. 80. With an amount like that, we find that the outstanding actually increases, since you are paying lower than the interest. Rs. 100 would keep the outstanding fixed at Rs. 10,000. So, it's clear that you have to pay *more* than Rs. 100 to bring the principal down.

# How can I repay exactly in 24 months?

So, how much do I pay so that I clear my due *exactly* at the end of month 23? (Note that we have counted our first month as month 0, so we complete 24 months at the end of month 23.) We have two approaches. One is to do some trial and error on the spreadsheet above to ensure that we get zero at the beginning of month 24. Alternately, we can use a mathematical formula to figure this out. Instead of presenting the formula, I will provide the spreadsheet formula that will give us the answer for this. We use 1&amp;#37; interest per month, and 24 periods in the formula.

    =PMT(0.01, 24, -10000, 0, 0)

Refer to the documentation for help on this function. This function returns us the magic number of Rs. 470.73. So, if we pay below this amount, we will not clear the loan in 24 months. If we pay more than this monthly, we can clear the loan faster. To visualize how the interest and outstanding move:

|Month|Outstanding|Interest owed at end of month|Payment at end of month|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0|10,000|100|470.73|
|1|9,629.27|96.29|470.73|
|2|9,254.82|92.55|470.73|
|3|8,876.64|88.77|470.73|
|...|...|...||
|22|927.53|9.28|470.73|
|23|466.07|4.66|470.73|
|24|0|0||

Behavioral finance helps explain the conduct of small investors. One important reason for the underperformance is the disposition effect. It is the tendency to sell stocks of which prices have risen since the time of purchase. Such stocks may have the potential to grow further, but investors book early profits. In other words, investors tend to sell the winners and hold on to the losers. 

For retail investors, they are better off taking the mutual fund route, either it is active funds or index funds, it's upto the investor's choice. Or maybe combination of both.
Not to mention SIP , should be a better option rather than timing the markets or sell now and buy later etc..

&gt;The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) have held exploratory talks to combine their operations and provide a one-stop shop for trading in all kinds of products.

&gt;Two people close to the development said that the two exchanges have appointed global investment banks to help in the discussions. NSE has appointed Morgan Stanley while JPMorgan is advising MCX, these people said. The merger, if and when it happens, will help create a bigger exchange with 60 per cent market share spanning everything from equity derivatives to commodity futures.

&gt;Rather than setting up new segments by themselves, a merged entity offering all asset classes would be good for participants. For one, brokers will not have to maintain separate demat or trading accounts and margins to trade would be fungible, saving costs to broker and clients and contributing to higher volumes in a universal exchange.

&gt;For example, an equity trader having margin in his account could deploy the same to trade in gold or crude oil futures on the commodity segment offered by the merged entity. Since trading in these commodities entails currency fluctuation risk, those could be hedged by selling rupee (against the dollar) on the currency derivatives segment of the said exchange. NSE already offers a liquid currency derivatives platform.

&gt;The strengths of both exchanges makes such a merger expedient, according to industry experts.

But, they were unrealised. Pleased by the unrealised, unreal profits I expended some money on unnecessary conveniences. Now, I realise how naive I was and still am. From May to August in 2014 the stock underwent a correction. I was patient and held on to my shares.

As expected, the weakness ended soon and the stock commenced another tremendous upward journey.

August onwards the stock movement was almost linear. By November, the stock had risen by almost 400% in 6-7 months.

My unrealised gains were 335%. How juvenile of me to consider unrealised gains as mine. Unrealised gains belong to the market. Its subservient to the market’s whims and fancies.

As always, every good thing has to end. Post November, the stock began correcting.
But, the downward movement was characterised by steep falls- Very similar to its ascent.

In 4 months, by April, the stock had halved. But, I wasn’t too worried. I had a decent gain despite the massive fall of 50%.

In the next 3 months, the stock halved again. Now, the share price was close to my acquisition price. In the meanwhile, quarterly results wereworsening. It warranted concern.

But, the management assured that the company was functioning well. Claims were made that the company ‘fundamentals’ were strong.
I placed my faith in them.
I wanted to exit the stock and preserve my capital. But, my mind was anchored to the peak price. Hence, I stay put.

Much to my chagrin the stock halved again in the next 2 months. I was devastated. Overwhelmed with grief.

I was staring at a 50% loss. From a profit of 335% to a loss of 50%. As I mentioned above, unrealised gains don’t belong to us.

It was a tumultuous stretch. I was contemplating averaging my holdings. But then, I received good advice from a fine human being.
What was the advice?
1)Never put good money after bad
2) Don’t be a victim of the sunk cost fallacy.
3) Don’t look at your cost price.
Evaluate the stock at its current price. Would you invest now if you didn’t have previous investments in the stock ? Don’t let the past influence your present action.

I was in agreement with the advice I received. But, it was difficult for me to survive this tremendous wealth erosion.
As a beginner, what baffled me was the dissonance between management commentary and financial performance of the company.

It was important for me to book my losses, learn a lesson and move on. But, I didn’t have the heart to do so. Somewhere I believed, that a turnaround would be scripted and the stock would regain it’s past glory.
Did it happen?
Unsurprisingly, No. The stock price halved again. The stock was reduced to 1/10th of its peak price.

I had to write off the investment.

Come to think of it, the company was in a precarious financial position. A massive debt obligation and ballooning expenses. There was no reason for the enormous share price appreciation. I should’ve book my profits.
But, then, I was a victim of greed.
Who has been able to resist the lure of making more profits?

What did I learn?

Take everything the management says with not only a grain, but a bagful of salt.
Their projections are more often than not aggressive. Make the requisite conservative adjustments.What goes up without a reason will come down without a reason.If need be, book your losses.Don’t make a decision with a sight on the acquisition price. Consider the present scenario and decide. It may have to be a difficult decision. But, doing so, will be beneficial in the long run.

Even today, I’m in possession of a token amount of shares- To remind me of my gullibility, imprudent actions.

I stare at a loss of 80%. But, I’ve accepted it and learned a lesson for life. I hope I can take better decisions in the future.

worldhello1221;1531540211;8yqheg;DISCUSSION;16;;55;"I had been deliberating initiation of a post discussing mistakes.
I’ve tried and recalled by mistakes, errors of judgement in my short exposure to capital markets.
Lesson 1:
I started taking a keen interest in markets in 2012.
My trading and investment decisions were based on stock recommendations offered by analysts on TV channels.
The returns generated were decent. I truly wondered why people thought trading/investing was difficult. I thought I had discovered the recipe for success in stock markets. It was easy. It required little effort from my end. All I had to do was imitate the analyst’s stock pick. Things were great. Until one day. The stock picks recommended for intraday started failing. It was unfathomable to me that I was losing so much money. I started revenge trading. Lost even more money. Whatever profits I had generated were evaporated in a relatively short duration. I could’ve never imagined such an outcome.
In hindsight I should’ve thought that there’s never a free lunch. Why would anyone offer their stock picks without anything in return?
Lesson: Trust no one blindly. Assess, examine trading/ investment decisions.
Every action of assistance, guidance towards us in the stock market should be looked at with glasses of cynicism. It’s a brutal place.

Lesson 2:
On a popular stock app there’s a bustling interaction medium. Stock picks are often offered for free and people wax eloquent about the tremendous potential the company possesses to multiply our wealth.
I came across one such message recommending investment in an investment company. It’d be inappropriate to share the stock pick.
The stock was described as being at the cusp of a great transition to being a large cap company. Messages loaded with superlatives describing the management bombarded the board. It seemed like the ideal investment opportunity.
I trusted them and invested 10 % of my portfolio.
The stock went from X to 3X in 5 months.
My happiness knew no bounds. I was ecstatic.
I continued averaging at upper levels expecting even more upside.
One day, the stock began its downward slide. Lower circuit after lower circuit. Surveillance measures were taken by the exchange and moved to 5% circuit. The fall was excruciating. It stopped when it reached 1.5 X.
I continued to average. Since, I had purchased heavily at upper levels my average price became very high. Losses incurred were significant. The fall wasn’t arrested yet. It kept falling. The stock had formed 35% of my portfolio. My portfolio was painted in red. There was little chance the stock would regain its past glory. I had to book my losses. It dawned on me that the stock move was a meticulously engineered operation by bigger investors. I had invested by trusting someone else. Not on my own conviction. Because of this the grief was even more.
Lesson 2: If possible avoid excessive concentration in any stock pick. Conditions can deteriorate at any point.
Introduce adequate safeguards to protect profits.
Booking profits will reduce cost of carry.
It was my greed that destroyed my portfolio.
It’s difficult to tame greed but those who succeeed at doing so will likely emerge victorious in the market.

Lesson 3:
In 2016, I came across a petrochemical company which was showing some signs of a turnaround.
Anti dumping duty was going to be imposed sooner than later and company’s financials would improve.
I invested based on this thesis. Management seemed to be decent. I invested 15% of my portfolio. It was my first turnaround investment.
When the results were declared the turnaround wasn’t very convincing. Instead of waiting and appreciating that turnarounds take time I exited my holdings.
I had purchased at X. I exited at 1.3 X. A 30 % profit. It seemed a healthy return to me in 3-4 months.
The same company, in the next 7 quarters underwent an extraordinary turnaround. From losses to double digit profit margins. And, the stock went from X to 5X.
I couldn’t believe my eyes. I blamed my luck and derived solace that I had some profit. But, heart of hearts I knew I had made a massive error of judgement.
Lesson: Be patient. If you’re convinced about a stock after enough research stay invested for some time. Investments take time to mature, to grow.
In investments without conviction profit booking would be sensible. But, if enough conviction has been developed- Be patient, do nothing.
Sometimes inactivity is better than activity.
Here, I was a victim of fear of losing money. Hence, sold too early.
Fear and greed are major causes of bad decisions.

Lesson 4:
An important lesson I learned is appreciating the role of luck and the limitations of our expertise.
I, have often mistaken my luck for skill. And, it has cost me a lot.
Stock trading/ investing is an incredibly complicated activity. There are so many variables involved that it’s difficult for linear thinkers like us to piece the information and take rational decisions.
To simplify the task, we resort to substituting difficult questions for easy ones.
Instead of analyzing a company based on its financials I’ll check if I like the product manufactured by that company and invest based on that.
I’ve succumbed to it often.
And, needless to say, I lost money.
Also, being rigid is harmful to us.
Despite knowing that a strategy doesn’t work, I refused to accept it. I suffered from the illusion of validity.
Acceptance is crucial for success.
Most factors are beyond our control. Frankly, there’s hardly anything in our control.
I stopped thinking of myself as a person who has everything in control and accepted the fact that I was at the mercy of variables I could do nothing about.
This change in behavior, approach helped me.
I started appreciating the contribution of luck in success.
From where we’re born, the upbringing we receive , the socioeconomic status are rarely in our control.
And,these factors play an instrumental role in moulding the future behavioral patterns of a person.
Lesson 4: The lesson I learned is that I should shed my delusion of being in control and acknowledge that despite my best efforts there will be consequences totally opposite to my expectations.

Lesson 5:
The most important lesson I learned is that I should have realistic expectations.
Stock markets aren’t get rich quick schemes.
It’s a way to participate in the growth story of a real business.
For an ordinary person like me it’s impossible to sustain 20% CAGR for long durations.
I tempered my expectations to 10-11% over the long term.
After all, what causes pain- When expectations are not met we suffer from pain, grief.
Solution is to have low expectations. If the outcome is better than our expectations our joy will be indescribable.

I humbly share the lessons I’ve learned. This forum has played an instrumental role in my growth as a person. My heartfelt thanks to each and every member here. This forum has helped me realize that there’s always something to learn. This forum taught me that there’s always someone better from whom we can learn.
It taught me that even veterans in investing are constantly acquiring knowledge.
Before my introduction to Valuepickr I spent a lot of time on social networking sites scanning the tweets of investors.
But, the forum helped me grow as an investor thanks to the massive collection of structured information which is constantly updated by members.
Yet again, my gratitude to all.
My apologies if I’ve erred.
Best wishes.

Largecaps are in a catch-up situation. Small and midcap indices just hit it out of the ballpark in 2017. The smallcap and midcap indices were 40-50-60% up whereas the large caps lagged behind. Hence the correction. We started the year with largecaps rallying, especially some of the technology names and few of the others.   


In the correction after that, there was no big fall in largecaps. The index is almost flattish and the funds have been either around the index level. Largecaps form the core part of the portfolio that is the one which should always be there. Smallcaps would be your growth driver which you buy and forget for the next 10, 15 years in your portfolio.

\2.	what about the sec80TTA Rs10k exemption from total SB interest?  
	I see Schedule-VIA PartB section 1r : ""80TTA - Interest on saving bank Accounts"" , should the entire Rs40k interest from SB go here, or only the 10K?
	I see the value in right column maxes out at 10K, no matter what we put in left column.   
	Does the value I put here get added to ""taxable income"" computation?  

\3. where do Dividends go?  
	a. from equity MF (tax free)  
	b. from debt MF (DDT prepaid)  
	c. from equities (tax free)   

\4. where does PPF interest go? (this is tax free / exempt income)  

\5. Where does Long Term Capital Gains from shares go? (this is exempt income)   
6. Where does Long Term Capital Gains from equity MF go? (this is exempt income)

worldhello1221;1532252741;90wq02;Discussion/Opinion;32;;11;"The recent market meltdown has been excruciating. I’d like to humble share my thought that it’s crucial to make amends to our strategies. But, it’s equally important to salvage ourselves. Such catastrophic losses possess the potential to change our very being. It possesses the potential to make us feel empty, listless, aimless. It’s just the beginning and it’s brutal.

To overcome this gloomy state of mind I tried to search for some help on the Internet. I did find some helpful content. I’ll try to be brief and list some points. Hope it helps.

A) Confront the loss
When we incur a loss, in any sphere of life, we often try to numb our grief, pain. As much as we try we can’t run away from grief. Only when we acknowledge our grief can we overcome it.

B) It is okay to grieve
It’s crucial to find an outlet for our suffering. Grieving is step in itself to overcome grief.

C) Share your thoughts with others
Sharing often lightens the burden on our shoulders. Being supported by family and friends is a morale booster.

D) Have no regrets
We made some investment mistakes. We learned a lesson the tough way. But, forgive yourself. To err is human. Don’t dwell in the past.
Don’t focus on what could have been done. Focus on what can be done. Focus on now.

E) Take care of your health
Loss of health is far worse than the loss of wealth. Don’t let this momentary difficulty ruin your health. A healthy mind resides in a healthy body. Take care of yourself.

F) Be patient
Overcoming turbulent phases takes time. Healing can be a long, long process. But, don’t give up on life. Be optimistic.

G) Distract yourself
Indulging in activities like walking, writing, painting can distract our mind from the loss. There’s much happiness in the simpler pursuits of life.

I’d like to explicitly mention that I’m not a counsellor, therapist, etc.

I just wanted to help as a friend. As someone who’s trying to survive the meltdown.

I do realise that my post may not be congruous with the theme of this thread. But, please bear with me.

Hope it helps.

worldhello1221;1532318134;913ugv;Discussion/Opinion;9;;29;"Dear all,
I’d like to share expressly at the beginning of this post that my intention isn’t to swamp this thread with my posts. I was going to group the content in this post with my previous post. But, the resultant post was painfully long and that would have made the reading laborious, arduous thereby preventing effective communication.
Hence, I’m composing this post.

What I’m sharing today is very close to my heart. It’s the description of the life of a person dear to me- My grandfather.
And, from his life, there definitely is an important lesson relevant to investing that can be learned.
My grandfather’s life is such that it truly inspires me.
He was born almost 8 decades ago in a family that wasn’t endowed with resources. He was the eldest child.
They had only enough money to live hand to mouth.
All they could afford was food and a roof over their heads. But, it was a closely knit family.
My grandfather was ambitious. He had a desire to alleviate the troubles of his family and provide them with a better standard of living.

He had the gift of the gab. A powerful speaker. He had a stentorian voice and a firm command over various languages.
Since childhood has was charmed by law.
He would read Perry Mason books ever since he became a teenager. He borrowed books from friends since he didn’t have the wherewithal to buy it.
After attaining a graduate degree in science , he resolved to study law. Those days education wasn’t very expensive.
But, to his misfortune, the apprenticeship he secured post law didn’t pay enough to ensure survival. Circumstances were dire.

He then applied for the position of a clerk at a private bank. The pay wasn’t much but it was enough to survive. The private bank was later nationalised. It was the Bank of India.

Through sheer dint of hard work he rose through the ranks.
He had a smile on his face- Despite not being able to pursue his passion of law he had done well for himself and his family. It was the satisfaction that hard work, dedication provides.
He retired from the bank in 1997, when he was 60.
Despite saving most of his income the amount accumulated wasn’t substantial. There was the threat of savings exhaustion.

Hence, at the age of 60 he applied for a job at another private bank. He had attained extensive experience in handling NPA cases which ensured quick absorption in the industry. It was a skill that was in demand.
He had decided to not only save but also invest his income to ensure a better life in the future.

He commenced investing in stocks- It was passive investing funded by his job at the private bank post retirement.
Bank of India had an initial public offering in 1997.
My grandfather, thanks to his unflinching loyalty to his former employer invested consistently in the stock.
His acquisition cost was around Rs.35.
2 decades back Bank of India was a sterling performer.

In 2008, the stock surpassed all previous highs. Several family members tried to convince him to book his gains. The returns were decent. But, he let his loyalty come in the way of decisions. He stay put.
2 years hence, the stock crossed Rs. 500. It was unprecedented. Yet again, he didn’t sell.
It has been on a downward slide since then. It has been almost 8 years now since the peak.
He has held the shares of Bank of India for 18 years now. The returns have been a paltry 7% CAGR.
Fortunately, he had invested in some other stocks which did well.
Does my grandfather regret the decision?
Not in the least. He refuses to sell even today. He won’t ever sell it. I respect and admire loyalty. If only I can imbibe some of his traits I’d be a much better person.

Was it a good decision to hold?
No. My grandfather got attached to the stock. The outcome was, as expected, bad.

Lesson:

Never get attached to any stock

Introducing emotions in investing is almost always a bad decision

Avoid considering a 10-15-20 year duration.

 The economy is in a constant state of flux.

 Periodically review investments. 

Replace underperformers.

Today’s star performer may be tomorrow’s laggard.

Gluttony: Excessive consumption of food or alcohol. The obvious beneficiaries are food manufacturers and alcohol producers.

Greed: The beneficiaries of our greed will be get rich quick schemes.

Sloth: Most humans have an innate characteristic of being lazy. Any service that makes it easier to buy a product will be hugely successful.
Example- Amazon

Envy- It’s envy that we harbour that fuels our decision to acquire materials, which boosts our self importance. Any product or service that helps attract eyeballs and in turn elevate our status will exist as long as humans survive.
The obvious beneficiaries are luxury goods manufacturers. At the end of the day, luxury goods are status symbols and status elevators.
White goods and automobile companies could also be beneficiaries of this emotion of envy.
Also, the travel and leisure industry. Most importantly, the housing sector. Better the house, better a person feels about oneself.

Pride- What humans wouldn’t give to feel better about themselves? What boosts our ego?
Jewellery, Clothing, etc.

There certainly will be evolution of tastes and consumption patterns will change. But, finally, most buying decisions are triggered due to either one or many of the aforementioned emotions.
An industry catering to these desires of humans should do alright

-D1-;1532505404;91pvd5;;13;;9;"Before proceeding, let me clarify some terms I will be using with specific reference to direct equity here.

***

Direct equity = All equity instruments except mutual funds, ETFs and discretionary PMS

Direct equity allocation = Employed capital + Unemployed capital

Employed capital = Exposed capital + Risk management capital

Exposed capital = Capital deployed in market (value at stake and prone to erosion)

Risk management capital = Capital used for hedging + Idle cash in broker's trading account provisioned for managing drawdowns, restoring exposure and maintaining margins

Unemployed capital = Capital committed for planned, strategic or opportunistic deployment

Liquid net worth = Cash + Savings (bank or post office accounts, FDs, emergency fund, expenditure fund for all fixed/variable/periodic outflows, etc.) + Investments (equity, debt, precious metals, etc. excluding real estate, physical/depreciating assets and any amount unredeemable due to lock-in period)

Utilization (%) = Employed capital / Liquid net worth

DEV = Direct Equity Veteran, whose (A) utilization has stayed above 15% since May 2013, **and/or** (B) net profit from direct equity treated as business income (post-tax, highest tax slab) &gt; capital gains (STCG and LTCG across all asset classes including equity, debt, gold, real estate, etc.) + interest (from all fixed income sources including bonds, deposits, etc.) for each of the last 3 financial years as well as current financial year till date

Base year = 2013 for A-category DEVs, 2015 for B-category DEVs, 2013 for DEVs who fall under both A &amp; B categories

***

Would appreciate if DEVs could answer the following questions (requesting folks who don't meet the DEV criterion and DEVs who are only willing to answer a few select questions to please refrain from posting top-level comments):

1. Which DEV category do you belong to - A, B or both?

2. What is your definition of short-term, medium-term and long-term? Which of them is your preferred holding period?

3. What benchmark (any index, custom parameter, personal goal, etc.) were you using for direct equity performance in base year? Has the bar been raised (or lowered) over time? If yes, what do you use now?

4. While evaluating tax-adjusted performance, what do you actually compare against the above benchmark - direct equity allocation, employed capital or exposed capital?

5. How often do you review such performance?

6. What is your current utilization? What is the peak utilization you have ever worked with? What is the level beyond which you are [now] no longer comfortable?

7. In order to mitigate risks and/or exploit weak/flat markets, do you go beyond the vanilla buy &amp; hold (un-hedged long-only positions) as a way of utilizing direct equity? If no, i) what is the approx. volume-weighted average holding period of your positions [fully or partially] exited since base year and ii) what was your approx. utilization as on 3/3/2015 and 29/1/2018?

8. What is the maximum proportion of direct equity allocation you allow to be exposed to any single stock or trade?

9. Exposed capital is currently what proportion of your employed capital? What is the lowest it has been since base year?

10. Direct equity allocation is currently what proportion of your liquid net worth? What is the highest it has been since base year?

11. Exposed capital is currently what proportion of your direct equity allocation? What is the highest and lowest it has been since base year?

12. What was the ratio of your average annual living expenses : direct equity allocation in base year and what is it now?

13. Do you also participate in the stock market via indirect equity (mutual funds or ETFs)? If yes, what is the current ratio of your employed capital in direct : indirect equity?

14. How do you treat direct equity from tax perspective - capital gains or business income? If both are used, what is the split as per your last filed return?

15. What are some things you [sort of] knew but regret having had to learn the hard way?";11519;Few questions for veteran direct equity players;

I have started off with some beginner tutorials online which have helped me to an extent but have left some of my queries unanswered. Alright, let me start off with my query with an example.

As of today, ITC share price is at 301.60. Say, at this share price, I purchase an ITC 290 put at a premium of 3.30 expiring on 27th Aug and the share price of ITC falls to 295 in the next few days. Will I make a profit by selling my ITC 290 put?

So what I'm trying to understand here is that although the share price has fallen to 295 and the expiry for my put is way ahead, **295 is still above my strike price**. Will I make a profit in such case?

The videos I have seen mostly talk about what happens on expiry and what happens when the price crosses my strike price, I never found an answer for my question(Maybe I'm checking out the wrong tutorials).

Hello India investments,

I'm back again with my analysis  and thought process in the current market.

I had posted here in end of January and also end of may regarding what's happening with Smallcap and Midcap index.

The correction has been brutal in Nifty Smallcap 100, which fell from 9657 to 6923 on 19th July 2018. That's a drop of whopping 28.4 percent.

The story is similar in NIFTY Midcap 100. It crashed roughly 24 percent.

The correction was so brutal that in Nifty Smallcap 100, only 14 stocks were above 200 DMA and 86 were well below, most 50 percent below.

If my memory serves me correct, before the last elections in 2014, there was an almighty collapse in NIFTY Smallcap of 32 percent. And that was the time I picked up some gems which gave me multibagger returns.

I personally feel that this correction has been brutally overdone and a lot of great companies are avlaible now at PE of 3 to 10. As thus, instead of fear, we should be picking up and selecting the new multibaggers.

I'm especially bullish on Ruchira Paper, Joindre, Rain Industries, Avanti Feeds, uflex, thirumalai chem, redington, imfa, jm financial, Phillips carbon, pfc, REC, tinplate, vedanta, capital first and also LEEL.

Most of these stocks have great managements except LEEL and the PE reflects that. Others have been hammered.

Amy opinions???

And any beaten down gems you see in the market with low PE and high EPS growth or revenue growth.

Thanks and best regards.

FitCheetah;1532937058;9325g5;;0;;1;"**What are Arbitrage Funds?**
[Arbitrage Fund](https://www.nivesh.com) is a type of equity mutual fund that capitalizes on the mispricing between the cash/spot market and derivatives/futures market. In simple words, it refers to taking advantage of the difference in pricing in two markets at the same time.

**How does Arbitrage Fund work?**
This fund works on the principle of buying at a lower price in one market and selling at a higher price in another market to make profit. Say, a company's stock is trading at Rs 500 in the cash market and at Rs 550 in the futures market. So, Rs 50 per share is the profit an investor can make by buying stock in the cash market and simultaneously selling it in the futures market.
Exiting the funds prematurely involves a nominal penalty, usually 0.25-0.5% in the first three to six months as compared to 1% in case of bank FDs.
Arbitrage funds can be redeemed in three working days.

**Who should invest in Arbitrage Fund?**
It is perfect for the investors with a lower risk appetite as it is the safest option in the time of volatility. The arbitrage opportunities exist only when the markets are unstable and uncertain.
Those who want to stay invested for medium to long term.

**Why should one invest in Arbitrage Fund?**
Safe option to park money when there is persistent volatility in the market.
Returns are likely to be much higher than investment in savings account. The fund managers reduce the risk of equities by hedging against the derivatives.

worldhello1221;1533223704;9408wd;;10;;9;"Dear all, I’m not familiar with people who’ve chosen equity investing as their vocation. When I came across a person, at a social gathering, involved in investing full time I couldn’t be happier. The person is a childhood friend of a very close relative of mine. To simplify the narrative let’s address him as Mr. A.

I requested my relative to facilitate an interaction with him. Mr. A was kind enough to grant an amateur like me a hearing.
I was accompanied by my relative who was the intermediary.

We spoke at length. He was generous enough to share his experience in various fields of life. There were aspects in our conversation that, in my humble opinion, are relevant to investing.
I’ve tried my best to distill the discussion.
If I err my apologies.

About Mr. A-
Mr. A is a person in his early 50s. He, since childhood had been a decent performer at academics. He excelled in his matriculation exams. As a result of that, he was granted admission at a decent engineering college.
Thanks to his impressive graduation scores he was offered a job at a leading electronics technology company. He was 22 then - 30 years ago.

He began saving from the word go. He would invest a major portion of his income in stocks. As time passed, he matured, developed an interest in investing. He had the willingness to learn more on investing. He commenced his equity related knowledge acquisition pursuit. The pursuit began when he was 23 years of age. It’s still on. In the meanwhile he got married. While he was still learning he had been investing small amounts in the well known multinationals of those days.

He worked at the firm for 26 long years. He did well for himself- Earned well, reached a senior managerial position. All in all, he had a cushy job and a desirous life. Everything was great.

Until, one day, he realised that he was nothing but a cog in the massive corporation. He felt that his life lacked meaning. There was a lack of satisfaction, happiness. He thought that investing could provide meaning to his life.
Did it? He answered it in the later portion of our interaction.

I had always thought that materials would bring happiness. But, this conversation changed my thoughts. It changed, to a certain extent, my perspective of life.

Finally, 3 years ago, after consulting with his immediate family members he decided to tender his resignation. Initially, there was resistance from his relatives. But, he assuaged their concerns and took the plunge. Also, it’s pertinent to note, that by the time of his resignation his children were about to complete their education and become independent.

THE INITIAL PHASE OF FULL TIME INVESTING :
He began by saying that it was tough. There was too much time and too little work.
He would read annual reports, books on investing, reports from financial services companies. He read everything that he possibly could. He spent almost the entire day restricting his activity to his study. And, then made some more investments. Investments in addition to his previous investments. For the first 90-100 days his schedule was exhausting.

But, as usually happens, when you start with too much energy, eventually you experience burnout.
After 5 gruelling months he experienced the same problem- Lack of meaning, lack of happiness. He was confused. He was doing what he enjoyed- Full time investing. Yet, he was unhappy. Financially, he was stable. But, plagued by aimlessness.

THE 3 MONTH TRIAL
Now, what could he have done?
He thought of giving this process 3 more months. If he didn’t feel better he would resume his job.

He tweaked his schedule a bit. Now, instead of reading books by himself, he collaborated with people who had already retired. They would meet, discuss stocks and everything under the sun that impacted stocks. The people involved were veterans in the field.

After interaction with experienced investors he would interact with those who were beginners. He would guide them, teach them.

Also, he began practicing Yoga.
He would think for hours together. Just think.
He also expanded his reading to topics as diverse as archaeology and travelling. He began reading everything. He has a tremendous collection of books.

He introduced drastic changes in his lifestyle. Cut down on all unnecessary expenses. Tried to live a frugal life. Initially, it was tough since he was used to conveniences. But, he had resolved to shed his dependence on these objects.
In brief, he began to live a minimalistic life. His expenses went down significantly.

At the conclusion of this 3 month trial period, was he happy? He asked me to hazard a guess. I responded that he must’ve been unhappy and craving the luxurious life he lived some time ago.

He told me that I was wrong. He had never been happier. He experienced true joy. Bliss that his fat paychecks could never give him.

By helping others he found meaning. By practising Yoga he found peace. By becoming a minimalist he found freedom.

The words he shared now had a lasting impression on me -
We believe we are constantly in the pursuit of money. But, we don’t want money per se. We want the power to acquire materials. When you minimise the need for materials you simplify life.
Often, luxury becomes a necessity. Once that happens, we become subservient to the job.
The more we get the more we want.
He explicitly mentions that a lifestyle devoid of materials is tough- It isn’t for all.
He tried it and he embraced it.

It’s been 4 years since he left the job. He hasn’t been happier. His investments have done reasonable well. But, it’s not of much use to him now. His needs are few. He has become benevolent. Finally, he has a reason to wake up in the morning with a smile. He ends the day with a smile. His life is simple but there’s satisfaction.

He explicitly mentioned that had he asked a financial planner before leaving his job he would’ve been discouraged to do so. But, it worked out well for him.

He concluded by saying - It’s not always about the money. Ensure that you have enough for your needs. For your luxuries you will never have enough.

He had finally found meaning and satisfaction- Though not in investing.

A truly remarkable personality. He isn’t a celebrated investor. He’s a common man with an incredibly journey of discovery.

worldhello1221;1533291433;948dsz;Discussion/Opinion;10;;0;"I'd like to begin by expressing awe at the quality of discussions being conducted here. I was filled with immense joy when I came across this page. I'd like to share a description of the journey of a person who had pledged his loyalty to financial independence.


 I'm inclined to believe that there are some lessons that can be absorbed from the afore referenced person's life. It can help us make better decisions.



I present an account of the life of my father's paternal uncle. I won't delve into details of his childhood as it isn't value additive.




He is a 68 years old man. On graduating with a degree in science decades ago he was provided an employment opportunity at a leading private bank. His salary wasn't substantial but there was room for upward mobility.



He joined as a clerk. But with passage of time and regular promotions he became a part of the officers' cadre. This elevation in position provided an impetus to his salary. He had spent his childhood in spartan conditions. An austere life wasn't foreign to him. And, despite having a decent salary he continued to live a life of minimal comforts.



Living a life devoid of comforts permitted him to save significant sums. A couple of years after his induction in the bank, his organisation was nationalised.
On reaching his late twenties his parents beseeched him to get married. But, he was desirous of living a life of abstinence.



On hearing this his family members were devastated. It was an agonising piece of news. They implored him to get involved in a conjugal relationship. He was firm. Declining marriage fractured ties with his family members.

He continued to work exceedingly hard at his job. He would earn, save and invest in stocks. His performance was being lauded by the company. He climbed the corporate ladder swiftly. It wouldn't be wrong to say that he was venerated by junior employees by the time he was in his 50s. A moderate lifestyle and celibacy had ensured substantial accumulation of funds.




He retired at the age of 60. His savings would allow him to live a remarkably comfortable life. Stock investments made years ago delivered exemplary gains. His annual budget could accommodate a couple of foreign trips every year. Post retirement, to diversify his portfolio he was desirous of making some real estate investments.
He sought assistance from family members.


It emerged that a leading Indian company was constructing housing infrastructure in the city of his residence. At this stage I must mention that the building company is a subsidiary of an Indian behemoth. Its the bellwether of India. It has sterling reputation.People speculated that this project could deliver 15% returns for the next 7-8 years.


 He was entranced by this prospect. Enquiries were made. He resolved to invest 60% of his net worth in this development. We were startled. He was advised against this substantial allocation. But, he justified by stating that it was a short term investment opportunity and his funds were safe thanks to the glowing stature of the parent organisation.

The project was completed in 18 months. It was a cluster of appealing buildings kissing the sky. But despite timely delivery of apartments there wasn't appreciation in the price. On the contrary prices were decaying. He wasn't perturbed. He chose to wait for a longer period.



Much to his displeasure falling prices weren't arrested. His short term investment metamorphosed in a long term investment. He had to stay put perforce. His mind was a anchored to his acquisition price.


Booking losses wasn't his style of operation. It's been 7 years since his investment. He sold his apartments a couple of months ago at a 35% loss. Not including the loss of interest.



He is melancholic, agonised and seeking help from a counsellor. It was a catastrophic decision. Sometimes we perform the right actions. It's just one error of judgement that ruins us.

Also, we learn that despite being invested in a project managed by one of India's finest companies, unpleasant developments do occur. No one, absolutely no one has any idea of the future movement of investments.



Sometimes, even doing everything right doesn't lead to favourable outcomes. We can only hope that happenings in our lives aren't detrimental. Rest we have no control over.



My best wishes to all. Please excuse erroneous remarks. If this post in incongruous with the objective of this page please guide me.";11682;His mistakes;

worldhello1221;1533726355;95l1i1;;5;;21;"Just yesterday, I came across an article on an uber-popular stock market blog discussing the investment of a celebrated investor in a distillery company.

The investor being referred to is believed to possess the Midas Touch. When I read the price at which the stock was trading, I was flabbergasted. It was a shock to me.

The Reason-
Off late, I’ve reduced my exposure to capital markets. Thanks to my inability to devote enough time to evaluate stock ideas and scout for new ones. However, a couple of years ago I was able to dedicate a substantial portion of my schedule to studying stocks.


 This facilitated discovery of some stocks in their pre rally phase. But, as much as I hate to admit, the finding didn’t lead to wealth creation for me. Low PE investing was fundamental to my investing strategy.


Today I realise that I was lazy to perform a detailed assessment. Hence, restricted my analysis to price earnings multiple. But, in most cases it has served me well. So, no complaints.



One such stock that created massive wealth over the past few years is the aforecited distilleries company. Exactly 2 years ago I came across the stock on a popular stock application. The stock traded at around 10 times earnings. And, the company was growing faster than the earnings multiple. The lazy me was lured. Profit margins were low but the valuation was difficult to resist.



I succumbed to the temptation and invested in the stock. The amount I had saved to invest wasn’t substantial. But, it gave me a feeling of pride, happiness.



Now, it was time to be patient for the market to accord a better valuation. However, I was suffering from a predicament- A moral quagmire.


I kept asking myself whether I should stay invested or not?
Reason- I feared that it would be unethical to stay invested in a distilleries company. I was scared of retribution. I was an immature youngster.


After contemplating for a couple of days I decided to sell the small holding I had. Over a week the stock had appreciated by around 5%. The transaction fees were around 2%. Hence, the profit was around 3%.


 The gain wasn’t much. But, I experienced a relief. In the meanwhile the stock continued to surge. I stopped tracking it after a couple of weeks.




When it finally came to my attention recently, the stock price devastated me. It had appreciated by an enormous 400% in just 2 years. I was on the verge of an emotional outburst.



I then thought about my reasons for selling out.
Why exactly, 2 years ago, did I sell with hardly a 4% gain? Fundamentals were intact. Business was good. 

Still I sold. Why?
Fear. Fear of retribution. Since childhood I had heard people say that alcohol was bad, unethical, immoral. I expanded that notion of mine to investing. And, in hindsight, took the unwise decision of selling the stock of a good business.



The potential profit could have been spent on many welfare activities.



2 years back, I wouldn’t have been able to explain my decision. I was morally dumbfounded. But, today, I realise, regardless of the stock price appreciation, that it was indeed an imprudent step.

 Different people have different moral standards. I’m nobody to discuss what’s right and what’s wrong.



But, I intend to share the message that something that I had been taught during my childhood, years and years ago, influenced my investing decisions. Our biases, teachings subliminally affect our decisions greatly.
I lost my profits but learned a lesson.

I don’t know if I’ll succeed at my endeavour but now onwards, I’ll try to take steps to minimise the effect of my biases, prejudices on my actions. I must try to base my decisions on reason, rationale. Easier said than done. But, I’ll try.

And honestly, it’s a gut wrenching experience to miss out on the stock appreciation despite being a fairly early entrant.


My tuition fee to Mr. Market. The learning continues.


I’m aware that I post too often on this thread. The sole reason being that in the past few years I’ve made too many follies to ignore. Posting here helps me to learn. Please excuse me if the posts are not upto the mark.

worldhello1221;1533784873;95sw82;Discussion/Opinion;16;;9;"Dear all,
A couple of months ago a dialogue featuring   one of India’s preeminent full time investors - Mr. Vijay Kedia was conducted.
His story is one that’s unlike any other. Truly awe inspiring and motivating.

There were so many nuggets of wisdom in the interaction. I’m fairly certain that it’ll help me mature as an investor. I’ve tried to summarise the session. If the transcript has errors, it’s inadvertent, please excuse me.

The interview begins with a brief introduction by Mr. Shah on Mr. Kedia’s illustrious investing career.
For Mr. Kedia, investing is love, sweat, tears and joy. Many are tremendously passionate about equity investments. But, not many are able to mirror Mr. Kedia’s success.
To this, he humbly responds that he hasn’t achieved anything great. He says that he’s still a work in progress. Per him, failure is a teacher like none other.


Mr. Kedia is a firm believer of this success formula-
a) Knowledge
b) Courage
c) Patience
Mr. Shah asks if courage is the ability to survive a period of lull in the market?
Mr. Kedia responds with an emphatic yes. In the stock market, money is made in long term investments. He says that he says this from his personal experience.


A major criterion to assess investment worthiness is a clean management.
Mr. Kedia says that as a person managing his own money, he has the liberty to restrict his investments to companies with top quality management. It’s the luxury of being an investor of one’s own money.



A mutual fund manager, on the other hand, is subject to various rules and regulations which often may impede the journey of wealth creation.
For an investor, lack of pressure is a luxury.



Mr. Kedia then talks about his strategy of generating alpha. It’s a simple acronym with potential to generate wealth.
S- Small size
Now, Mr. Kedia clarifies that by small, he doesn’t necessarily mean small capitalisation. By small, he refers to the small size of the overall market share occupied by a company.
For example- A company has 200 crores sales. But, the market size is 5000 crores. This would definitely qualify the filtration process. Since, there’s ample scope for expansion of market share.



A small sized company( per the slice of the total market occupied) graduating to a larger company generates enormous wealth.
Not many large caps can deliver such returns. There definitely are some exceptions. Maruti Suzuki being a glorious example.

The interviewer remarks that for small companies, return ratios won’t be appealing.
Mr. Kedia responds that he doesn’t pay too much heed to return ratios. He states that management quality, fire in the belly and potential for growth are much more important for him.



He then shares an interesting case study featuring Dettol and Savlon. Despite being similar products, Dettol has almost 6 times the market share of Savlon. This could be attributed to the fact that consumers think that Dettol works better because of the stinging sensation on application. We think that it must work better because it hurts.



On similar lines, we often think that, returns must be better when we employ complex strategies to evaluate companies, preparing overwhelming Excel models, etc.
But, Mr. Kedia disagrees.
He states that investing is simple but not easy.




He then shares other portions of the SMILE acronym.
Medium in experience
It may not be wise to invest in companies having promoters with little experience. The reason being lack of exposure to market cycles. Like stock markets, businesses also have cycles.


 Passing through these cycles helps a business promoter emerge stronger and with a nuanced understanding of the sector. As previously mentioned, failure is a teacher like none other.




Large aspirations
It’s the business promoter who needs to possess a desire to grow the business. Complacency should anathema to a business owner.

The next abbreviation is CHNGE.
Ch stands for Chamcha- Sycophants.
When a business promoter is surrounded by sycophants, it often leads to poor decision making and dissipation of ambitions. It leads to saturation with the success achieved.

He stands for Health. Often, promoters may have best intentions for the company. They may possess a tremendous desire to take the enterprise to an elevated position.
In growing the company from small to moderate size, businesspersons may reach the age of 50-60 years of age, when health doesn’t lend as much support. This may prove to be a roadblock to further growth.



NG stands for Next Generation
In case of the key manager growing old, it’s important for family managed businesses to plan succession. More often than not, it so happens that the next generation has no desire whatsoever to run the business. They may not be motivated enough to manage a blooming corporate. In such cases, growth may plateau.

E stands for Ego.
The foe of any sort of growth - Ego
When ego grows, anything else ceases to grow.




He politely states that it was a favourable time that gave him the opportunity to invest. He also appreciates the contribution of luck to his success.




He then observes that there are hardly any hidden gems left. Most stocks are discovered in this age of abundant information.
He is then asked the recipe for generating alpha.
Mr. Kedia gives a one word answer- PATIENCE
Believe in the story. Stick to the story. And, sail through.




He then, without any hesitation, acknowledges that he hasn’t been an entrepreneur as successful as he is an investor.



As an investor, not a lot of emphasis should be placed on price targets and price targets.



A jovial disposition, humility and willingness to share his vast treasure knowledge differentiate him from others.



I reiterate, I’ve tried my best to curb errors in interpretation. If any, please excuse me.

worldhello1221;1534007301;96i3tb;Discussion/Opinion;7;;1;"Dear all,
Today, I’d like to share the summary of an interview conducted 2 years ago. It was conducted by Mr. Puneet Khurana.
The interviewee is the fund manager of a top class mutual fund. The organisation is known for running a single mutual fund. The interviewee is Mr. Thakkar.


I’ve tried my best to be succinct. The following content is an extract, a summary. If I’ve missed some points worthy of mention my apologies.



THE BEGINNING

The interview commences with a brief introduction of the interviewee. Mr. Thakkar shares his education background. He was born and brought up in Mumbai. He was exposed to capital markets literature since he was 7 years old. His father was a long term investor.



 He didn’t employ sophisticated investment strategies that are prevalent today. But, placed faith in a company’s potential to grow its business. Mr. Thakkar was lured by the markets. His family encouraged him to pursue his studies. On conclusion, he was free to choose his vocation.



He graduated in 1992. He then joined Prime Securities as a trainee. From 1994 to 1999, he worked in the merchant banking and corporate banking division. From 1999 to 2001, Mr. T worked in the fixed income division at another broking house.



In 2001, Mr. Thakkar associated with a legendary investor.
Finally, Mr. Thakkar shifted to the equity asset class.




Journey as a fund manager
As I previously mentioned, the organisation Mr. Thakkar currently works at runs just 1 mutual fund. The interviewer sought a response as to why more schemes weren’t launched and why the company doesn’t offer portfolio management services.



His response was straightforward.
Years ago, it was a hassle to launch a portfolio management services. Client on boarding was an inconvenient task. It was a prolonged process. Mutual funds, on the other hand, we’re scalable.



And, he remarked that companies launch multiple mutual fund schemes to capitalise on the booming sector and increase their assets under management.
Example- In 1999-2000, technology focused schemes were launched.



In 2005-2008, infrastructure, real estate schemes were launched.
He believes that opportunities in the market can be taken benefit of with just 1 scheme without resorting to unethical means.



Often, financial services companies launch too many schemes to take benefit of the law of averages. When too many funds are managed by a company, some are bound to outperform the index. The company will then wax eloquent about the outperformer and bury the underperformers.


The interviewee believes in ethical wealth generation.
He is happy to be under scrutiny. He, along with his team is invested in the fund. His interest is aligned with the interest of his investors.


He doesn’t desire to be in the top 5 or top 10 mutual funds. He invests for the joy of investing.
He encourages investors to invest with a time horizon of at least 5 years. To prevent short term thinking, there’s an exit load of a couple percentage points, which flows into the corpus and rewards long term holders.




He is a proponent of diversifying into foreign markets,especially the USA. Almost 25% of the AUM is invested in USA. They don’t invest in niche US business. But, business that are mainstream, well discovered. Hedging is done by investing in exchange traded future contracts. It provides almost 90% protection from currency fluctuations.




STYLE OF INVESTING


Mr. Thakkar responded in an epigrammatic fashion.
He likes to invest in quality businesses at reasonable prices. He refrains from cigar butt investing. Reason being the failure of activist investing in India.



Minority shareholders aren’t able to influence decisions of management in India. Whereas, in the US, investors like Carl Icahn exercise their rights as shareholders and ensure management acts in the interest of minority shareholders.



What prevents activist investing in India?
A simple answer- High promoter shareholding.
When the promoter holds 60% of the outstanding shares, it’s difficult for other shareholders to collaborate and object. But, changes are being made. The right steps are being taken.



Value unlocking takes place when the promoter desires




**Stock Selection **


There are multiple strategies Mr. Thakkar adopts for stock selection.

Run stock screeners
Track activities of investors he admires
Read voraciously





PARAMETERS FOR STOCK SELECTION


Qualitative

a) Promoter quality

b) Treatment of minority shareholders

c) Past actions of top leadership


Quantitative

a) Return on Capital

b) Low debt

c) Decent sales growth

Along with various other parameters in public domain


But, he mentioned that companies with aforementioned characteristics are often expensive. Hence, the right time to buy such quality businesses is during corrections. Or when the market ignores the sector.
Mr. Thakkar, in an unequivocal manner explains that it’s imprudent to buy companies at ridiculous valuations citing quality. Quality has a price but don’t overpay.



SELLING DECISION

Mr. Thakkar believes that the decision to sell is tougher and more important than the decision to buy.

Sell, when the price incorporates even the most optimistic scenario.

Sell, when the thesis to buy isn’t valid anymore.

He guides that if a mistake in buying was made, exit. Even if it means booking a loss.

There’s no right or wrong approach here. To each his own.

MISTAKES


a) GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE

Mr. Thakkar believes that it’d be a mistake to invest in sectors with heavy government interference. He says this from the bitter lesson he learned form his investment in oil marketing PSUs.

Also, government interference destroyed his investment thesis in Noida Toll Bridge.



b) CYCLICALITY

Mr. Thakkar regretted his investment in a cyclical investment management company. He invested at the peak. Despite 10 years having elapsed, the price hasn’t surpassed it’s previous high.

Cyclicality, if made use of correctly, can be a massive wealth creator.


VALUATION TECHNIQUES


Mr. Thakkar shared some hilarious quotes which deserve to be known by a wider audience.

DCF is like the Hubble telescope. Move it 1 inch and you’re in a different galaxy

The best software for fiction is an Excel spreadsheet and not Microsoft Word.


He believes that the intrinsic value of a company isn’t a precise number. It’s a spectrum and the value could lie anywhere in between.


Trying to project intrinsic value to the decimal is a futile task.
We often tend to be delusional while projecting earnings years down the line.
Be realistic.

Mr. Thakkar believes in the following equation:
Current price = True fundamental value + Speculative value.

True fundamental value incorporates what’s on the books of the company. Also, cash flows expected over the next few years.

The art is in evaluating the speculative value.

He advises us to be conservative in our projections. It’s unwise to pay top dollar for hypothesis.

He adopts a stock specific approach. He doesn’t pay too much attention to index levels.

If opportunities are available deploy cash, else stay in cash.

He generously shares his wisdom in this interaction.
And, encourages us to be in the pursuit of knowledge. He himself is a regular reader.
If I’ve erred please excuse me.



I’ve tried to the best of my ability to ensure that my interpretation of Mr. Thakkar’s comments is appropriate. If I’ve flawed, my apologies.
If there is any factual error by me, it’s unintentional. Yet again, apologies if I’ve erred.

ank_;1534013663;96iwo5;;7;;18;"So I see lot of talk of market crash and I too agree with it. I believe this has to be the top . I have my reasons for and against it. I know that this is all probability and no one knows what would happen eventually but what do you guys think ? did I miss any points in my thesis below?

Case for major correction:

1. We are at all time high w.r.t. Nifty PE ratio currently &gt; 28. This is at 2008 level.
2. Actual market has already corrected and its only few heavy weight stocks which are holding the index(HDFC and Reliance).
3. Emerging markets have already corrected upto 20 % just that India is holding firm.
4. A spike in dollar would doom us, increasing our CAD, inflation and Interest rates, reducing growth and rupee. This would be not just India but all EMs
5. Same for Oil shock. (Although this looks less likely)
6. Soon opinion polls would start coming and many are expecting present government to lose seat/vote share. Perception of economy is one thing, But actual people who vote are having mass unemployment and bad businesses because of decisions in last 2-3 years.
7. Trump has actually spared us till now. We are hiding behind China when it comes to Tariffs. Although our exports are not that much to US.
8. We have been in a global bull market cycle for close to 10 years now. On an average its time for cycle to reverse(87,98,2000,2008).

Case for continued bull market

1. Earnings are expected to improve surely this/next quarter (Have been hearing this for three years).
2. NPA mess is over and worse is behind us surely for now(Have been hearing this for one year).
3. There is no general Euphoria in market yet. I agree with this one. In 2008 I remember the top was near when Reliance Power IPO was listed and everyone was trying to get a demat account.
4. Generally bull markets comes to an end with a blow off top with Euphoria as mentioned above. We are not near that phase.";48741;This has to be the market Top;0.92

sdhaja;1534062090;96nsnq;;19;;16;"Excerpt:

To lump sum or to STP is the question?

When markets are close to new highs a lot of investors ask the same question.

    ""I have some money in my bank account, should I invest it as a lumpsum or buy a liquid fund and setup a Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) into an equity fund over a year.""

Over time two narratives have emerged:

1/ STP – why take the risk of investing at highs? The market will likely mean revert so averaging your buy price over a year is the way to go.

2/ Lumpsum – time in the market is all that matters. Since we cannot predict what the market will do (can go higher or lower), just invest as soon as you have the money.

The advisor community, by and large, has adopted that STP is the way to go.

We ran a backtest to see what historical data suggests.

Lumpsum investing has outperformed STP even when market are making new highs. Lumpsum investments are likely to work out better 60% of times and with higher expected returns.

kungfufightin;1534418235;97red5;;4;;2;"I had made a thread earlier asking about what would happen if Zerodha disappears or stops being responsive or blocks your account. Given that they are completely privately owned (by a few guys?) relatively new broker, I wouldn't rule out that possibility.

From what I understand, if Zerodha doesn't allow us to rematerialize our mutual funds, we will not be able to trade them. Note that we can only **view** our folios on CSDL / NSDL but we **CANNOT transact** with them directly on CSDL or NSDL. A lot of people have this misconception that you can login to CSDL / NSDL and start transacting mutual funds. But they require an intermediary broker.

The question is, are there other brokers who readily transact mutual funds like Zerodha?

Another argument that has come up is, CAMS can also block you and you would be locked out. CAMS however is way bigger and handles a huge percentage of mutual funds in India. They are also partially owned by NSE.

Note that my argument does not apply to trading stocks on Zerodha because there are other brokers like Sharekhan which you can use to trade your stocks in demat if Zerodha blocks you. This thread entirely pertains to mutual funds.

liverbirdxyz;1534682876;98k01x;;32;;17;"So I found this sub mainly because I was looking for some advice on whether a certain property that I was planning to rent was within the advisable limits etc. Now, I've gone down the rabbit hole about buying/renting and I went through a lot of posts here in this sub about the pros and cons of buying instead of renting.

I'm now curious about a slightly related but a very different topic. A very hypothetical scenario in my case but I'm sure there are people who do something like this.

I would like to understand this sub's opinion/thoughts on buying for renting out.

Here is a hypothetical scenario for us:

Assumptions:
1. A person has a corpus of 80lac rupees with nothing invested in the stock market. Lets say about 10% of this money is invested in FDs.
2. This person has a family - spouse and a kid;
3. The gross annual income of this family is 20lpa;
4. The family has a paternal flat (where the elderly parents are currently residing) in some city which is worth about 30lacs.
5. This family lives away from the parents in a different city and is renting a place for 25k rupees a month.

Given this, if this family were to consider buying a house in the city where the parents live for about 65lacs, with the sole intention of letting it out on rent where the expected rental income would not be more than 15k rupees per month (at this point in time), would it be a wise decision?

If it is, then how would you go about buying the said property? What amount of money would be funded via bank loans and what amount would be coming out from the corpus at hand?

Is buying a second property in the city where they live worth to cut out their own rental expense a good idea?

Sorry if this is a vague/hypothetical scenario, but given the general tendency of leaning towards renting over buying, I wanted to understand whether the rule of thumb is the same in the event someone is actually sitting on a lot of cash.

Can someone expand on the following:  
&gt; Today, most of the indices we have are meant for traders and business-channel watchers, and not long-term investors. How do the index providers pick stocks to include in the Nifty or Sensex? They look at free-float market cap, liquidity, impact cost, etc., etc. Fundamentals like EPS growth, return on equity, debt-equity have nothing to do with being in the index. Effectively, only the stocks that are most fancied and actively traded can get a place in the index. As a long-term investor, you would be keen to buy the opposite type of companies - those with good growth, ROE, etc., but which are not well-known in the market.
