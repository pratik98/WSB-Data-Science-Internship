Gabenism;What you need to know is SANP has secured two-year financials for auditors, hired a new CTO, and moved from analog precious metal mining to Crypto mining with tons of news on the horizon for '18. I expect the 0.0013 I bought at to come up to 0.0090 by February. If you drop $500 on it, I'd say ride it out for a month. Only put in what you're willing to lose. I mean, I put in $370. Worst case: I lose $370. Best case: I make a few thousand bucks. If you don't put in more than you're okay with losing, you're free to be optimistic, and I'm actually very optimistic about SANP.;1514917499;ds37zk9;t3_7neq6d;4

The fact of the matter is that some companies and individuals are extremely good at logistics, or manufacturing, or technological skill, etc. so they go into business into that speciality. Apparently Bitmain feels their competitive advantage in the marketplace is in their manufacturing/logistics and they do extremely well. It is much easier to manufacture and sell thousands of units than to mine with them. No upkeep and no headache of keeping the rig running.

The crypto stocks on coming to terms with the highs that were made in Dec. The folks that bought up will sell at every opportunity they get. The resolution is to shake those people out over time with price drifting lower (really a pullback). See $MGTI after it hit it's highs in Aug.. textbook example. Note, this is not a prediction, but guidance on where I initiated and place stops.

I am bullish on $MGTI, but at this price, I would hold (I am from 1.70-ish). If it drifts to the 3s or high 2s, I would recommend initiating a position or adding. If it does not reach the 3s, go on to the next ticker in this raging bull market!

$BTCS is a little tough. It has a lot of support at .12, but it is hanging on to a consolidating range above it. A similar thing happened a couple of months ago when .0785 was a big support level. It ended up dipping to .0785 and bouncing hard. It technically IS at a good spot to open a position, but you have to be ok with a .11 stop.

While I agree that if you want to make real money, you have to short and long. For that you need a real broker.  With a real broker comes the advantage of OTC stocks which have a potential for more money, but are a little less predictable than NASDAQ stocks.  

The other advantage with brokers like Ustocktrade is that you can day trade all day long since it doesn't have a PDT rule in effect.  This means that you can scalp away.

Penny stock CEOs would realize they could make a shit ton of more money, with just a little more innovative effort. I mean seriously, even the ""real"" companies on the otc market are doing the bare minimum. ";1515134481;ds7sw9q;t3_7o5u4o;1

KidWonder101;"Eh, somewhat but I wouldn't call it a mutual fund. Mutual fund managers act as passive investors and don't really seek out to help the companies they invest in with their day to day operations.

I'm an immature prick? The first comment that was made on this post which was by you, was extremely immature. 

All I asked was for legitimate responses on the business model and you wanna make jokes. That's why this sub is so dead now.

PaperPlait;"A shorthand version of blockchain is the authentication process between transactions... Similar to what cryptocurrencies use. The reason it's so valuable, it basically negates theft or forgeries. When companies turn blockchain, part of the algorithym anticipates their missing profits turning up, and numbers that have been mismatched for so long will be found in the rubble. Blockchain kind of gives small companies and big companies alike the same exact transactional opportunities as what we would think of for Banks, or international trade.

It basically works like this: say you want to transact the dollar to your friend. That dollar represents a AAA, the middleman, whatever Bank you use or whatever, represent AAB, and the final part of that transaction when the dollar gets to your friend is now AAC. At this point, the entire transaction becomes Global, everybody can see how everything happened... that dollar isn't lost, because we know exactly who came from, and where it went to. That's how it negates forgeries and mistakes, block chaining allows us to watch and Trace every step of a transaction process.";1515394820;dscuuny;t3_7odpmj;2

Sadly I only had 20 shares :( I've never seen him so confident on a call before (MBOT not PTIE), I really have high hopes for this one, I know jack shit about the company, but the chart looks like one of the safest penny swing plays I've seen.

Ragefan66;"Didn't see this comment till now. I wouldn't go more than 3,000, and if you do go more than 2-3,000 I would set a higher stop loss at around .97-.98. Do not set stop loss above $1, easily one of the safest swing charts I've ever seen, and this stock has an insane bottom at 1.03/.4. 


It all depends how much funds you're rocking though. If you have 60k+ you can easily buy 10k shares with very little downside. If you only have a few grand or a couple hundred you can definitely YOLO half your funds on this one with a safe stop loss. I'm personally YOLOing this one with a little IDXG.

Ragefan66;"Personally I'd set that stop loss in the .90's around .94-.97 because of how strong the support is at 1.02-.04, and if the floor finally breaks below $1.00 it has a bigger chance of hitting a huge stop loss spree and falling, but I've also seen MM take out stop losses like pros before bringing the stock back up so it's a tricky situation. His latest recommendation within the last 30 min has been MRDN if you're interested. Looks like a solid swing to me, bought in a few shares and I'm contemplating buying more.

Also if you see an entire sector just start to go off.  Find ones that haven't really popped yet.  Play for flip.  It was like this last week in December with the pot stocks and mid December with the Bitcoin associated stocks.

I still can't emphasize enough that sub pennies are not to invest in and 99.9% are scams.  Also anyone selling you a system is selling you bullshit.  They are probably just changing you only to front run your ass.  It's a shady biz these sub pennies.";1515282576;dsaodov;t3_7om3qx;12

They launch in June but you can invest now.  I got in at .56 on the OTC, currently it is up to .64.  Probably will be very volatile for a while because there won't be real news until June.

Talonx4;"I received a pm from a new trader asking what I meant by 52 week support pattern.  

Putting it simply, most stocks have a support and resistance level.  Resistance is where the investors deem the stock to be over valued.  It's a level where the stock really can't go above without a major push.  You will usually see them around big round numbers. When you see that stock that always gets to $1.98 but never crosses $2.  We call this resistance.  BTW, for those of you new traders, when it crosses, it will usually gain very fast.  

Support is levels that investors deem the price is a deal.  So they buy in.  Once a stock reaches a certain point, investors can deem it undervalued or ""as low as it will go so to speak.  You can identify it on a chart by finding where the stock never gets lower than that price point.   And for new traders, if a stock goes below support, watch out as it will usually crash quickly.

No. You didn't buy it.  You put in an order when the market was closed.  When the market opened, it was worth more.  In other words, you don't buy anything.  You simply have an order sitting there that has not been filled because the stock was never at that price after you put the order in.  ";1515444821;dsdsud7;t3_7p12h9;2

";1515514520;dsf6h7q;t3_7p7lm2;7
Gabenism;Mostly, it's speculative hype, sure. But the fact is that they *do* have auditor-friendly two-year financials finally secured which will help legitimize them. They're also going to be functioning as a host for Chinese Crypto-mining company CanoePool to get into deregulated American crypto-mining. This is advantageous for SANP because China is threatening to kill their Crypto-market. SANP gets money from Crypto and will likely become a niche forerunner for entry-level crypto investors to get in the game. There's a lot of promise. But again, there are a lot of impatient speculators. My thinking is only invest what you're willing to lose. I put $370 in. Worst case, I lose half of my Christmas bonus. No big deal. Best case scenario, I make my projected $2,000 by March. This helps keep me from being impatient and getting trigger happy as well as ensures I am only willing to sell for profit. I'm in until I make bank or they get delisted, myself.;1515517318;dsf9atb;t3_7p7lm2;6

Buy when the stock breaks the 52 week high.

Buy when the stock is at the support point.  

Sell before you hit the resistance point.

Sell if it crashes under support.  

Realistically, you can make a calender of when stocks will release earnings and if they have done well on previous earnings, buy a week before they release, and sell right after they release.

But when I went to sell it, I did the same thing except switched the action to 'Sell.' But when the market closed, it said the Sell was expired.

So does this mean I'm stuck with these shares until the next time the market opens? If not, how do I properly sell these so I can receive the funds from my profited gains?";1515795332;dslcxhh;t3_7pzw9w;3

TD Ameritrade lets you set a limit sell for 6 months, which is great if you are holding any stocks long term.

There is no reason to believe that they won’t get it, however it would be nice to see an official pr from the company stating the current status.

WarrenPuff_It;With big board stocks, sure. Even ETFs/ETNs would make it cost effective to do so, but pennies are too risky in general. Unless you're investing and timeframes are less specific, it sounds like you want to swing trade. Don't do it with pennies, your losses/drawdowns will rack up in the long term. If you want higher volatility, switch to ETFs or leveraged ETFs for higher percentage gains, but be careful with those as well. What broker are you with, Questrade?;1516066564;dsqr5fc;t3_7qmwkz;1
fadyhanna54;Yes I'm using Questrade..... I was just curious since pennystocks rise and dip so often, why can't I purchase a lot when it dips and just wait for it to swing back up and sell them. I'm patient enough to wait several months if need be. ;1516068192;dsqsmpz;t3_7qmwkz;1
WarrenPuff_It;"Timing the regular markets is hard enough, with pennies there is a reason they have such a shitty share price, the companies are absolute shit and usually that derives from a board of crooks/bad business people who run their business by endlessly dumping shares on the float. Sure, some of them, a fraction of them, are legit businesses with future potential, but the vast majority are terribly run and their share price reflects that reality. If you want to baghold endlessly, you can, but your chances of doing successful swing trades in pennies over any prolonged period of time is infinitely smaller than if you were to do it successfully with different asset classes. I'm not saying you can't, there is nothing stopping you from trying, I'm just trying to save you from unrealized losses that you haven't started yet. Pennies mostly go down over time, fact of life. 

Their are people who play pennies professionally, but keep in mind that two of the most famous people to do so in the modern era was a monolithic ""pump and dump"" tycoon who was so successful they had to change how OTCs were traded, and a college kid from NY that made a name for himself shorting dotcom penny stocks in the aftermath of the bubble. That's a scam artist famous for orchestrating a massive pennystock scheme, and an amateur-bear who got caught the right side of a retail-level pricing discrepancy during a historic bubble? Both geniuses in their own right for how they exploited loopholes to con people like you and I, but also it should be noted that the con artist went to jail and died shortly after being released, and the NY savant blew up his account in 2008 because he was a one-trick pony, since then he's made money off selling coaching videos and email alerts...

lnovack23;I do not advise this. Most penny stocks are bound to fail because most of them are terrible companies. Most of these companies thrive off of news/press releases and have one or two day pops. Long term investing is a bad idea for penny stocks ;1516075814;dsqz6cz;t3_7qmwkz;2

seanxor;Your main issue is that you are limited to 3 day trades a week. The 10$ fee will have the same impact whether you sell with 40% profit the next day or sell with 30% profit after a week. Personally, this rule would not bother me, I very rarely sell the same day, I usually hold for a couple of days while monitoring the stock.

levishazam;there have been rumors about moviepass doing an IPO, but no solid news. HMNY still owns 70% of MP, so its a great way to invest in the growth of Moviepass.

levishazam;"Right, and Moviepass makes money by selling subscriptions for movie theaters. I know how Uber charges customers, but Uber lost 2.8 BILLION dollars last year. Investors bleed money into uber to try and take hold of the ridesharing market. My friend takes uber everyday in SF and gets a premium service for like 5 dollars a ride. Uber subsidizes his rides because he is a frequent user. 

Moviepass is working with a similar model, one that is very popular in the tech industry at the moment. Bleed cash to obtain the market, and once you've got it no one can beat you out. Its a long-term game. MP is planning on getting the majority of the movie patron market, and influencing the industry in their favor once they have it, but also giving life back to the dying industry.

Mineral exploration began with a mineral claim acquisition agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”), with GEXPLO, SRL (the “Vendor”) and the Company, whereby the Company agreed to acquire from the Vendor a one hundred percent (100%) interest in a claim (“the Claim”) located in the Dominican Republic. The owner of the Vendor, Alain French, became President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and Director on the acquisition closing date.On April 10, 2015 the Company entered into a plan of “Exchange Agreement”, whereby it acquired Cathay Cigars of Asia (“Cathay”) a Florida corporation. Upon the acquisition Alain French resigned all roles as Company officer and board director and issued back into treasury all preferred shares and common shares of the Company. In conjunction with the Exchange Agreement certain liabilities between Officers and mineral exploration partners of the Company, were settled in the form of notes having various terms. As per the Exchange Agreement, Franjosé Yglesias became President and Chief Executive Officer and Matthew Arnett became Chief Marketing Officer, each receiving 150,000 shares of preferred stock of the Company for their interest in Cathay.With the acquisition the Company changed its operations to a lifestyle brand, marketing high value luxury lifestyle products to the leisure and entertainment sector.On July 15, 2015 the Company re-domiciled to the State of Florida from the State of Nevada.On October 15, 2015 the Company filed a Form 15-12G to relieve itself temporarily of its filling obligations with the Securities Exchange Commission.""";1516230786;dsuafgs;t3_7r1lsp;3

Did you get a chance to read the shareholders notice for BTCS? They alerted the SEC that management plans to fold if their merger with Blockchain Capital doesn't go through. I wonder about these penny stocks.";1516239398;dsui3h7;t3_7r1lsp;3
DudelyMore;"It has probably just been a shell all along or became one along the way. Problem with OTC, and even worse if an overseas company, is that there is very little oversight. You have to be double careful if a stock is not on the major exchanges. If it looks like a pump and dump, it probably is. 

Always with OTC I sell half if I double up so I am on a freeroll. Usually I just take 25% and never look back. I hate to see people ride a 10x+ pump and hold through thinking they found the Holy Grail. 10x IS the Holy Grail! Sell it, go buy some good scotch, and be a spectator while other people rationalize the stock price plummeting as they try to average down or to decide when they've had enough. Been there, never doing that again. If a stock looks like it is doing amazingly but company has no plans to seek listing on a major exchange, there is always the chance it is because they do not want to be scrutinized.";1516255027;dsuu974;t3_7r1lsp;2

The fed reserve basically prints money (some people might argue this point). With a blockchain backed currency, creating new money is not only likely to be more difficult but people will be able to get a good idea for where that money is going. I’m willing to bet the government would not be in favor of this.

I don’t mean to imply there is some money conspiracy happening, there are pretty good reasons the government wouldn’t want this type of transparency in the money supply that don’t have bad intent. ";1516468685;dsz1qg1;t3_7rq2wk;8

I agree it's bad in the long run, but it has allowed America to look rich beyond belief.  Two cars and a home for every American.  If all that money was tracked, we would find that it doesn't exist.  Banks basically loan out more than they have and if people saw that there was literally no cash and that their investments and savings accounts are basically IOUs it would cause a panic.

ModerateStockTrader;"These are my thoughts too. I need to get a more former and fundamental understanding of stock trading though. As for now, I'm just picking up stuff as I go.

What are your fav low float/low outstanding stocks?

Mine are INTV and NUGS. They move like 10% or more with low volume. 200k volume is enough to send them moving.

The stocks with the opposite effect are CBIS, TEUM and TRTC. I bought that CBIS in a rush and paid for it. It dropped 20% after I purchased it and it is stuck teetering around the .10c range.

I did more research to find out why it wasn't moving with 50 mil volume and found out that it had 2 billion shares outstanding!";1516575715;dt16j46;t3_7rxa3p;2
Boots-n-Bell;"Yeah I still like the potential of TEUM. I was in it and made a little last week. For me personally it’s all about developing your own system. I have read a ton of success stories and a ton of failure stories. I have tried to blend them all together. Never going to be perfect with your picks, but about limiting loses and maximizing gains. So my system is real simply. “Only buy stocks with good news,  sell immediately if they drop, and hold if they running but as soon as volume slows then sell.”  

It let’s you bail quick on bad picks and let’s you keep making money if it is climbing. Since middle of December i have made about 50 trades and have been 80-85% percent accurate at least. 

Number one rule is keeping emotions out of it. By far hardest part of the game.

In today’s day and age its so easy to use all resources available.  I always use linkined to find company’s employees. Then i add them on social media. Very good way to see what the company is up too 

Oh and i agree with rushing into a stock can be bad idea. My biggest loses have been exactly over same reason. Didn’t do enough research then paid for it! ";1516585170;dt1g1mb;t3_7rxa3p;2
Boots-n-Bell;I have found my biggest wins normally happen when i own a stock for around an hour or less. I never want to be holding a stock unless it’s a start up company and i see crazy growth coming soon. For example i was in DPW for 15 mins a few weeks ago for a solid $1150 gain. In and out and take your profit even if it’s a few bucks. ;1516586000;dt1guzt;t3_7rxa3p;3
Boots-n-Bell;Ok last one. But i would never get in a company like this one (LMFA) with it being shorted at a 50% rate. Only way I would think about it is with crazy good news and the shorts are starting to cover. So the run would be happening and I’d get in and out fast. With that many shorts you know people will double down and keep shorting it;1516586178;dt1h1jo;t3_7rxa3p;2

lmnfaggot;"ICLD is prime to have a several hundred to thousand % pump with the exception of an RS being enacted.  Back in December they announced intention for a big RS however last time this happened it took them a year to enact the split due to FINRA having to sing off on it.  That split caused 90%+ losses for any long.  The reason for the potential pump is that the dilution from the previous RS is almost at maximum allowed shares.  Once it is maxed out investors will return and it will fly.  ICLD is having a bit more attractive balance sheet as compared to 1 - 2 years ago.  I suspect once allowed shares are maxed they will dump some good news as they have been very quiet lately.  Most ICLD investors I know are hoping for it to go to at least 0.02 -0.03.  There's a few dreamers hoping for 0.10.  Check http://otce.finra.org/DailyList every day for ICLD.  If you see a RS listed then sell and run away as fast as you can.  If no RS happens and they show some revenue from their new project netlayer.io then that could really lead to huge gains.  Investors were hoping for contracts relating to the Houston Hurricane but so far no news.  Additionally ICLD received a Wells Notice recently.  Usually that is bad news however if FINRA doesn't allow the RS to enact because of Wells notice then the stock price will shoot up nicely.  

TDLR:  IMO ICLD will have crazy gains within a few weeks unless they perform a possible RS.  If RS then sell and run ASAP and then wait till that dillution is almost maxed.  If you buy check http://otce.finra.org/DailyList for ICLD RS every day to know it's time to get out. ";1516687037;dt3ovk0;t3_7s7h3n;3

nequalsone23;Medical background here- just wanted to weigh in on your research. I'm not saying BPX-01 isn't going to be an improvement on the drug but I do want to point out their development is in phase 2 so research should be taken with a grain of salt. I can't find their research so I can't comment directly but generally these can be small trials, non-randomized. Basically helps the company decide to move further down the pipeline but nothing concrete we can say about it. That being said we know minocycline works so maybe that adds something. Next question - is anyone else beating them in the pipeline? Phase 2 trials just determine if the intervention works, next they have to compare it to the current standard intervention to see if it's as good or better. Quick search shows another company, foamix, is already in phase 3 for a mino foam. Just some thoughts, I'll be adding them to my watch list so thanks for posting.;1516672451;dt3cu2h;t3_7s89aw;9
nequalsone23;Not sure if I'm confusing what you're saying but after phase III the drug is brought to market. Phase 4 trials are usually post-marketing surveillance. Idk about a phase 5. But I agree there is probably a year or three before they start marketing.;1516673065;dt3deoe;t3_7s89aw;2
nequalsone23;"Found the study, no results published yet but between what they have filed with the FDA and what they published on their website: no statistical significance for 2 grade reduction to clear or almost clear after the phase 2b with some 200 participants. In other words it reduces acne but no data showing reduction to clear or almost clear. It'll be interesting to see where they end up with BPX-01. BPX-04 sounds more interesting though honestly.

* You borrow the shares from your broker,

* Buy them back for the lower price and return them to your broker keeping the difference (profit).

That is called selling short, or a 'short sale'.

That is how people make money in crashing markets or bear (declining) markets.

**EXAMPLE**:

* I borrow 10 shares of Uranus Corporation at $100 per share and immediately sell them thinking that the stock price will fall. I now owe my broker 10 shares of stock. I pocket $1000.00
* The stock price falls to $50.00 per share. I buy back the stock for $500.00 and return all ten shares to my broker.

In some brokers there’s actually an option for “sell short” so that can prevent this sort of thing from happening. But on some brokers it’s just the regular “sell” button that is used for shorting, and if you don’t have any of those shares in your account then it is assumed that you’re shorting (which is what happened with OP).

Also to all those reading, as enticing as this may sound, remember the potential for loss in a short sale (it the stock starts going up instead of down) is (theoretically) unlimited.

I actually think someone on reddit posted that it was on their watchlist for this week and that’s how I heard about it. So I bought a few shares and when it jumped at open I sold half of what I had for a tidy profit and then jumped back in at the dip. 
The technology they’ve just released is ground breaking as it allows them to update existing reactors to make them safer and more efficient, so it saves nuclear companies money and produces more energy which will greatly help with the energy crisis once implemented. I’m really excited for this to catch on, it’s really revolutionary technology.

Ryael;"As /u/aurochfam mentioned, I've been watching for a while. I'll go over where I sit and answer any questions that people may have that I know how to answer. 

Disclaimers: I am not a professional trader, I do not work, nor have great knowledge, in the nuclear industry, I own shares of and am long on LTBR.

**What to learn ahead of time:**

[What is a Joint Venture (JV)?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp)

[What is a Letter of Intent?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/letterofintent.asp)

**My take:**

1) The JV, in terms of the business itself, is massive. We are talking about a company with a market cap measured in the teens of millions of dollars before this week joining the nuclear industry, where contracts are measured by multiple millions of dollars each. The reason the JV is massive is because it signals that a major player backs the fuel (AREVA NP, now Framatome), that Framatome will supply the fuel, and that further testing and approval can now begin.

2) From the [revised presentation released today by LTBR](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-16UEEM/5843380401x0x969560/96AB52DA-CBFF-48C8-BF3A-7A82C9BB42D0/Lightbridge_Rev_16_JV.pdf), we can find more details, though they could change at any time. My understanding is that after the 50:50 split, each contract will generate something like $10 million annual revenue per plant for Lightbridge.

3) As mentioned on page 23, they have an initial target market in mind. These are the Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) &gt;900 MWe in the US with &gt;20 years licensed life at 2025. The following is the list of qualifying reactors as of today. Note that some of the expiration times may change over the coming years to provide more reactors qualifying time.

[NRC](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/list-power-reactor-units.html)

[Wiki - List of nuclear reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_reactors)



Name of Reactor | Owner/Operator | MWe Capacity | Expiration Date
---|---|----|----
Beaver Valley U2 | FirstEnergy Nuclear | 920 | 2047
Millstone U3 | Dominion | 1155 | 2045
Palo Verde U1 | Arizona Public Service Co. | 1447 | 2045
Palo Verde U2 | Arizona Public Service Co. | 1447 | 2046
Palo Verde U3 | Arizona Public Service Co. | 1447 | 2047

Vogtle U1 | Southern | 1215 | 2047
Vogtle U2 | Southern | 1215 | 2049
Watts Bar U2 | Tennessee Valley Authority | 1165 | 2055
Wolf Creek U1| Wolf Creek | 1250 | 2045


4) We know Lightbridge has a letter of intent signed with a major US utility. I don't think we know which one or the terms.

Ultimately, the JV is the end of the Catch-22 scenario. Lightbridge was stuck needing a supplier/manufacturer, but to get that they needed a letter of intent from a utility. To get a contract from a utility, they needed a supplier/manufacturer. The LOI was signed a while back and the JV today.

**The Math:**

""25% penetration of the existing U.S. market, excluding global market potential, could generate $150-200M per year of revenue at 90% gross margins from licensing."" [Lightbridge IR](http://ir.ltbridge.com/)

So pull out your spreadsheets and copy and paste this in and start playing with it.



Royalties:Reactor | Years | Reactors | Annual Rev| Earnings %| P/E | Market Cap | Out. Shares | Stock Price 
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
$10000000 | 1 | 1 | =SUM(A2 * B2 * C2) | .9 | 15 | =SUM(D2 * E2 * F2) | 13800000 | =SUM(G2 / H2)

 Play with the royalties anywhere from $6-10 million per reactor (I run $8 for a conservative number) since we don't know the final number yet. Number of reactors. P/E. You quickly get a grasp for the share price of this company. Obviously it's more complicated than this but this is a basic layout of the capabilities of the share price.

**The Future:**

The JV was a big hurdle but there is plenty of risk left. There could be another meltdown somewhere, no one could sign a contract, Framatome could go under, you dream it, it is possible. I for one am holding most of my remaining shares for 10+ years, barring any drastic changes to the outlook. The nuclear industry is a very, very costly place to be and right now it is dying for innovation in a time when we need more dependable green energy to balance the exceptional growth of Solar/Wind.

The stock has had a lot of volume but not a lot of movement up. This is likely because we are waiting on an institution to take up a position. Institutions own 1.6% of the outstanding shares which is...nothing. If the JV is enough to get someone to invest the price will rocket. I don't know when or even if that will happen until a contract is signed with a utility.";1516929091;dt9023x;t3_7sy8wo;2

Ryael;"Great catch, I missed that completely. Here's the list of Exelon reactors. They're a mix of PWR/BWR and I think all of them have expiration times that don't match the spreadsheet.

It completely depends on what your trading style is.  Some traders will be successful with long term investments using Robin Hood.  Others will day trade on Ustocktrade while having under 25k.  Others will use Charles Schwab to short stocks all day long, and others will have hundreds of thousands thrown around using interactive brokers.  

To answer the question of ""is it worth it"" depends entirely on what you want to do and what you think you will be most successful at.  

Benefits are OTC, short selling, day trading, easy transfers to and from saving accounts, customer service, credit lines, level 2 data, ease of use, tools like think or swim, the UI.    There are tons of factors.   

I think one thing most of us can agree on is that if you want to make a career out of trading, a real broker is necessary.  ";1516950769;dt9g8wh;t3_7szhjj;1

And I can tell from one phrase: ""unless you’ve done some serious research."" This is actually the opposite. You need very little research to do well in pennies. It's about trading the volatility, mostly gleaned through patterns and looking at twitter for 5 mins. It's about trading on the psychology of other traders. So, for you, since you don't know what you are doing, it might be easier to get rich off selling dvds. But for anyone who is actually willing to investigate, and put themselves into the mix, it's clear that there is a method that is very lucrative.

BaronCapdeville;"I second the bid for Fidelity. 

If you are starting over 10k, and want to day trade once you hit 25k use Interactive Brokers, if not, use Fidelity. 

TD is great, and their “Thinkorswim” software is wonderful, but the additional commission doesn’t net you much compared to Fidelity. Also, Fidelity has outperformed in the realm of execution (anecdotal). I routinely get better trades out of Fidelity, and my Customer service experience has been quick and US based, even after the markets close. 

Just call Fidelity, and ask for a free year of ATP, their level 2 trading software. 

Use the fuck out of ATP, and start reading books and articles on trading. After the first year, you should have no problem meeting the 36 annual trades. 3 trades a month? Easy. Even if you don’t make the trade quota, you can pay sub $200 for another year. The platform is great, and super customizable. I have over 20 custom templates set up for various purposes. 

I’ve familiarized myself with the basics, and am now moving on to options. 

Once my portfolio hits 10k-15k,I will likely take everything but my Roth’s to Interactive Brokers. Better business model, and I plan to day trade once I hit 25k-35k. 

Final note: it’s nothing too special, but Fidelity’s basic 2% visa card is easy to obtain, and has an option of dumping your 2% directly into your investment account. I recommend this. The 2% accrues on literally anything you use the card for, effectively netting you a 2% discount on... well, everything, assuming you never carry a balance, like a good boy/girl. 

Yes there are better cards, yes credit cards are frowned upon by many subs, and for good reason, but this one is better than just ok, and you can easily manage it from Fidelity’s app, which runs smooth, is relatively secure (historically speaking) and 2% on everything adds up faster than you think. 

I tossed my debit card in a drawer and had my bank freeze it (regions bank let’s you lock your debit card within their app). We use the one credit card for everything from Netflix subscriptions, to the power bill, to gas and groceries. It keeps a layer of insulation between you and would be thieves. 

Also, don’t carry a balance. Oh, and if I forgot to mention it above... don’t carry a balance. 

Alright, Fidelity mode off. Resume your day. Haha. ";1517259474;dtfhzjx;t3_7t4pka;1

NorcalSteve22;"My 2 cents... anytime you use social media to get stock picks, the answers are mostly typically to a pump and/or dump— or people trying to make action on it. I see it often in the crypto sphere as well. The best thing to do is check out their site, then make your own judgement call. It took me some getting used to, but make your own plan, set goals, and don’t let your emotions make you break your goals. But that’s your call.

UtalkMEtilt;"Low dose naltrexone is the real deal. Do your research on it. IMUN has exclusivity for Lodonal TM throughout Africa. A high percentage of Africans with HIV / AIDS are untreated. Lodonal is very cheap because it is off label. The higher dose form, Nalrexone 50mg, was FDA approved back in the 70's / 80's and was a drug with DuPont. It was ineffective for what it was approved for, treating heroine and alcohol dependence. It became generic, but Dr. Bihari, who passed away in 2010, did research and found it to be highly effective in the low dose form 4.5mg. It was highly effective in the Nigerian clinical trials for treating HIV. Read up on it, the IBOX on IHub has most of the DD you should read up on, and you can ask questions on that board. I am a moderator on that board, dwarren428, but am currently in the Jailhouse for a few more days. 
To answer your question, it's an untapped market. Potential sales are enormous. 
Why haven't the big boys taken up this low dose naltrexone??? Big pharma doesn't want low dose naltrexone to have success because it is cheaper and they fear it will be more effective than their more expensive drugs. Big pharma will lose billions if low dose naltrexone eventually gets main stream exposure in the United States, specifically for Crohn's disease, which is seen to ultimately be the most profitable channel (although that is Cytocom). All my opinion. Read up on it. Big pharma is happy dragging this thing out for as long as they can, and that is what has taken it so long. IMUN also owns around a 10% stake in Cytocom, which will get Lodonal sales in United States if they are able to pass a phase 2b and phase 3. They have already passed trials in Nigeria, and received marketing approval, but are still awaiting final approvals from NASCOP (Kenya) and NACA (Nigeria). IMUN's Lodonal was already approved by NAFDAC in 2016.
The drug is the real deal. The expected sales are very high in my opinion. Read all the recent filings. It has been held down by a toxic debtor (see Nov 2nd 8-k), and other manipulations in the past. ";1517266675;dtfpen5;t3_7tut7c;1

A side note, please check out Investopedia and consider doing a paper account to learn about stock trading before investing with real money. Maintaining consistent profits in a portfolio takes experience and that first loss hurts a ton less when it isn't coming out of your pocket.

 “We have had a number of significant accomplishments since becoming a publicly-traded company just over a year ago – strengthening our balance sheet, IP and we recently entered into an agreement with CardioSert to acquire a novel technology to enhance existing technology platforms – just to name a few,” commented Mr. Gadot.  “I believe it’s important to maintain an open communications policy with our shareholders.  The bi-monthly Townhall Meetings is an efficient approach to ensure alignment on our strategy, demonstrate progress and provide updates.”";1517407099;dtinrtz;t3_7u9om7;3

melancholyeggyolk;"&gt; Yeah, I made a bunch of money but I fucked up, too. I did pay off my debt, car, and kept profit to myself but not nearly as much as I could have if I was smart.

I got cocky and thought I could be a millionaire in a few short months. I ended up with more than what I put in, but damn if I didn't just toss that all in some low risk long term option and not have to worry about money for awhile.

Saints420Fan;"I would advise any and all to honestly. It’s not a stock to day trade tho. This is one to load and wait on news. We’ve seen some good consolidation between 18-21 the last few days so a new base is forming in this range. 

Small history of the stock - it ran to .27 then ASCM ran it down as it does most stocks. All the way to .10 giving us all another load up opportunity all the way up to .23 recently where we’ve seen a little pull back and now building a big base in the 18-21 range. We had LOT of volume in the 22s also so I’m sure they are waiting for more news to load more also. 

Share structure is fantastic 

They purchased a positive revenue streaming business in January 2018 so it won’t show up on their 10k to close out 2017

So this was a company making small moves here and there before 2018 (they changed CEOs late last year or early last year?) Purchases a positive revenue streaming company (Fleaux Services) and THEN Within 2-3 weeks from that announcement - they release a 8K announcing that they extinguished ALL convertible debt! So they are firing on all cylinders. Current play is just simply waiting for 1 of 2 things:
1) news of another acquisition which would send this parabolic
2) 10Q highlighting a profitable 1st quarter from their new asset Fleaux 

*About their Purchase of Fleaux*
Purchased for 1$ and then MILLIONS of shares of GLFH. So essentially —&gt; Fleaux and GLFH’s fate are tied together. Talk about motivation for Fleaux to make this deal worth it by turning profits. Fleaux posted a presentation about the company and within it posts WIP spreadsheets showing upwards of 6+ Mil in contracts lined up for 2018!!!!! 

Jame Ketner, CEO of GLFH, Posted on a 8k in February that they are expecting a 0.04 EPS and 8 mil in revenue at the end of the year. Put simply that this values the company of upwards of 0.80 by the end of the year assuming they hit their projected mark. 

James Ketner and BOD of Fleaux own millions of shares of GLFH but they are not common stock (not all of them at least). Majority are Series A and Series B stock

Series A I believe is locked up until PPS of GLFH hits 0.45

Series B I believe is locked up u til PPS of GLFH hits 3.50 

Maybe have A and B backwards? But they need to avg those prices for 30 days before they can even sell them! So these guys have a lot of faith in the company. 

Sorry this is a DD bomb but I’m just laying 90% of it out here. Please do your own DD! Read their 10k and 8Ks from the last 4 months!!!! You’ll like what you see I bet. It’s not your average stinky pinky. It’s something I’ve used as a vehicle to ride instead of the the big board stocks since it’s actually making significant gains. Chart speaks for itself. There’s been 1 instance of over exuberance (resulting in ASCM walk down) but other than that it’s been a lot of bulls riding long. Not a lot of eyes on the stock yet. Pretty much has gained attention organically and not pumped. But yeah read up on your own and get in if you feel it bud! It’s at least a 4-5 bagger by year’s end as a stable hold if they hit their marks. Nothing close to a pump and dump repeat. Check the charts bud and GL! 

10Q has to come out by May 15th. That’s when the reallllll rise up will continue again big time IMO

zimboombah;"Did you read the 10k? What do you think of their claim that they are trying to close above a penny for 10 consecutive days before May 9th to avoid delisting form otcqb?

Are you holding any hope that it's possible they have some amazing news that will push this way up?
";1522790688;dwr7fev;t3_87n283;1
OriginalEmu7;"I just finished reading that part after you've told me about it, and I don't really understand what the ""OTC Pink exchange"" and ""OTCQB"" is. Just to make it clear penny stock companies don't usually follow the fundamentals of a normal company, which is why I wouldn't read the 10k or any other filings, they're usually just based off news and in this case, for me, the news had past and I'm still holding on to it which is worrying me. Can you explain to me what OTCQB and OTC Pink exchange is? (Google isn't very helpful)";1522813902;dwrws6f;t3_87n283;1
zimboombah;"From what I understand it is the middle tier of the OTC market place. Besides having to maintain a  .01 share price, they are required to report and disclose company events and finances where the pink sheets are not. I think companies that want to eventually be listed on the Nasdaq or NYSE have to work their way up the tiers. The next one is OTCQX.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcqb.asp

One primary motivation for staying listed on the OTCQB is for a wider range of investors to be interested in them and take them seriously - not only discerning retail investors but investment houses and traders that have more stringent requirements for which companies they can invest in.

The question really is whether these guys are in it for the long haul or just running a scam - dumping shares while running the company into the ground. ";1522816579;dwrz2y9;t3_87n283;1

WonkyWombat321;"All time low or at least close for a stock that doesn't have dilution in at least 2 years. I zoom out on the chart to make sure the price bounces around a decent bit instead of steadily declining constantly. Look at the HCEI chart for example. I bought 90% of my shares at .0005 because it was near all time lows, no dilution, low float, and had a habit of popping. 

That's the safest plays I've been able to find in the OTC, but you have to figure out a strategy that works for you. I would just suggest ignoring any ""buzz"" you hear on social media like twitter, facebook, ihub etc. Once people start shilling their stock it's likely too late to get in for a safe profit, but that's not always the case. I use this as a rule of thumb for a safer investing strategy...but I'm also very patient. I don't mind waiting on a bid for 6 months before flipping for a 100% gain in another 6 months. 

OTC traders are the least patient human beings in the world. Most trade down at these levels for the prospect of the next 10 or 100 bagger which do come along with a relative frequency...but most traders will just chase the current trend and cash out of plays at a loss that will eventually pop up again.

I realize I'm rambling here, but I wish you the best of luck. If you have any more specific questions I'm happy to provide any insight I can offer.

GTOInvesting;NATESTO, their main product, is about to see aggressive growth in sales due to other products dropping out of the market. Furthermore, it is the only Testosterone Treatment Therapy without a black label warning, making it the safest way for treatment on the market. In a recent study 70% of participants said they would switch from their current treatment to NATESTO. Right now NATESTO has a small share of the ~$2 billion market, if they can capture just 5% this will be ~ $100 million in revenues. Not to mention the 3 other products they have on the market and the reputation of their management team. ;1522786028;dwr1dca;t3_89a83v;2

Suggestion:
1.	Start with paper trade so you can get more confident and find a pattern that works for you. 
2.	Make sure you pick the right stock. Do your homework. 
3.	Create a check list to find stock before you enter. 
4.	Have discipline. Know when to enter and when to exit. (NO MATTER WHAT) 
5.	Once you used your 3 trade, DO NOT enter again in high velocity stock. You can lose money. Just wait or paper trade to keep practicing. 
6.	Keep your lose smaller than your gain. For me I only risk 5%. If it drop to that amount, I exit and try it different day. 
Some people will tell you to stay away from this. Me, I don’t care. This is money I don’t mind losing and is more fun than waiting for days. I see results in minutes and so far is working better than my long term account.

Luffykyle;Because they released their earnings report today and in it they discussed how they had a 33% increase in revenue and made 3 million dollars in revenue, but towards the end of the ER the CEO said something like “Our newest product that is pending approval from FDA has potential to grow this company as well.  It is possible that the FDA wants more data, and we are committed to providing that” and everybody freaked out and said “OH SHIT FDA *STILL* NEEDS MORE DATA??? Time to sell”.   That caused it to drop down to the low .70’s and I imagine that triggered a bunch of stop losses that plunged it to the .60’s. ;1522810798;dwrts51;t3_89ljbi;13

Luffykyle;Well it depends on how rich you are and how confident you are in the stock. Personally I have 4000 share of AKER and I spent a total of $1000 on it.

Luffykyle;Honestly I’m a little confused on what the CEO meant.  If we follow the typical FDA approval rate, then before May there should either be an approval or a denial.  If they had to resubmit it tho(which is what people assumed and panic sold for) then it could take up to another year.  But they didn’t SAY they had to resubmit it, that’s just the rumor on stock forums. So if all goes according to plan we should see it within 2 months max. ;1522821858;dws2rn8;t3_89ljbi;2

Saints420Fan;"I honestly don’t have a clue. So many stocks in the OTC are pump and dumps and what not. A long term hold is a rarity. 

I’m very very HIGH on a current play I’m on GLFH 
It’s somehow a long term hold. I post on iHub with people there. I’ve never actually pumped this stock up to anyone honestly cause I legitimately like to buy more when I get money since it’s still relatively unknown lmao 

Check it out some time. Just a summary;

-SEC filer - 10k audited from outside agency (always a +) 
-recently removed all convertible debt (shows commitment to shareholders)
- recently acquired a positive revenue streaming company 
- *posted projection for 0.04 EPS and 8 mil revenue at end of year (makes valuation of company by end of year possibly around 0.80 if they hit their mark) 
- CEO actually answers people - I spoke to him once on the phone and he encouraged me to call back any time, but I’m secretly afraid to cause I don’t want to sound like an airhead lol

It’s a relatively new company that to me has made some attempts to get some traction over the years and hasn’t quite been successful, but for a new CEO mid/late last year and now they are really starting to generate some good momentum. 

10k filing for 2017 and 8ks from this year (they bought the new company in 18’ so it’s not in the 2017 10k sadly) are online. Give them a read. Share structure is great too.  Pretty quiet company and don’t post fluff piece PRs so this is the peace before the storm when they release the 10Q from their first quarter with their newly acquired business they bought in January. 10Q is due mid May so I’m loading up.

Oh and the chart looks pretttttty solid too. The only blip on the chart was when the momentum got out of hand and ASCM came in and walked it down as he/she does all penny stocks.  But that told me ASCM was loading up for the tickers next leg up. 

Oh and 1 huge thing in the 10k that some people skim over. Galenfeha (GLFH) bought their new business for 1$ and instead sold them shares. Sooooo if the company wants to make this purchase worth it - they will have to do some good work :)

Insiders in the company have 2 series of shares locked up: some at 0.45 and others at 3.50!!!! Sooooo they can’t even sell until we make money lol.

Chart has been pretty steady as a rock for 3 months + (coincided with when the new CEO took over) 

It’s just screaming “winner” to me. Read the filings for yourself though if you wanna jump in. I told myself I wouldn’t come on Reddit and blah about this but since this is hidden in another post I feel better about it I guess lol ";1523491040;dx7qqg1;t3_89x4sm;1

Biotechs you really have to do some DD on what they are working on and you have to be willing to lose your money. As is pointed out most drugs never get approved. Development is very expensive most don't make it, not uncommon for a company to blow $500mill and never get the product to market. This is why new drugs can cost $10k / dose sometimes.

84fishforce;"Hey bud. You seem like a genuine person and I saw your post this morning but had to run to work before I could try to help you out a bit. I'm actually a complete and total beginner that just started looking into this stuff less than a week ago, but based on your questions I feel qualified enough to at least help steer your mindset in a more proper direction than it's at right now.

To answer this immediate question: Penny stocks aren't typically seen as ""investments"" because they're extremely volatile (prone to drastic movements up and down and generally risky). They aren't like your typical ""blue chip"" stocks (look this up if you don't know what that means, because it sounds like that might be closer to what you're looking for) which you can feel relatively safe investing money in over a longer period of time because they likely won't go under overnight. You can ""set and forget"" these kinds of stocks more than penny stocks. Penny stocks can go up 100% one week (or day) and then down 100% the next. This kind of thing won't happen with Disney or Apple. Of course, the volatility is part of the allure of penny stocks because you can double your money way more quickly than you ever could with a blue chip stock... or you could lose all of it if you make a bad decision out of greed/cockiness/stupidity.

You also asked someone else what they meant by ""paper trading"", and this basically means practicing with fake money until you develop a strategy for a long time before feeling confident enough to ""go live"" and use your real money. Some people don't do this and instead choose to use real money but on a small, SMALL scale to make themselves feel the psychological and emotional aspects that come with standing to gain or lose real money. Generally though you'll be advised to paper trade for at least a year of positive gains, and even then, nothing is ever guaranteed and you will likely still be on the losing side a lot of the time. It's just part of the game. From what I've read, the smartest way to play it is to only invest what you're comfortable with losing completely, and even then, get out once you've made 10-30% back (and ideally you'll be on the winning side 6/10 times, for starters).

You also mentioned that you don't have much time to invest into this, and unfortunately, that's a surefire way to lose all of your money and you might as well be gambling at a casino at that point. This does take a ton of time, a ton of reading, and a ton of practice before you can start making money without it being thanks to luck (and, again, you will likely still lose a lot or most of it at the beginning).

Finally, be extremely careful with listening to people that try to recommend or talk about penny stocks online. Most of them have a hidden agenda and are trying to manipulate you in one way or another (look up ""pump and dump"" for a further explanation). They tell you ""This company is the next Google and is guaranteed to explode 1000% overnight! Become a millionaire and buy today before it's too late!"" so the price gets driven up, and then they sell their shares once you've pumped it up for them (and lost your money in the process). I'm simplifying it, but look into it.

Anyway, this is one of the longest posts I've ever written but I feel as though you might get easily swindled if you're not careful so I felt obligated to try to help you out. I'm gonna go back to researching my ass off as much as possible. Best of luck, friend.";1523073317;dwyabo4;t3_8a9z2w;10

[deleted];Instead of getting worked up and taking time out of my day to educate you on your baffling ignorance, I'll just note that there is a about a dozen reasons it sits as a rank one buy for one of the most well recognized and accredited research sites.

[deleted];"I'll indulge you a little cause I'm bored as shit and in need of a break from writing this research paper on vaccine development. So allow me to do what I do best and dust you intellectually-

AUMN has a low P/E ratio that has been slowly rising. This information can be used to determine if the stock price is undervalued and a candidate for a breakout cycle. Not all stocks with an increasing P/E are about to enter a breakout cycle however, so you have to factor in many important variables to consider what potential you're dealing with. I've been taught to apply 4 rules to the stock in question and have yet to get shit on for following them. *knock on wood* In these cases you want proof of these 4 occurances: 

Does the stock. . .
1. have flat earnings or a growth trend over the years?
2.  have price increasing consistantly over 24 weeks?
3. have a Rank One or Two Buy rating? (if you use advising sites- but, like, why wouldn't you?)
4. average a 20-day volume greater than or equal to 50,000?

Meeting these criteria means that the stock has an expectionally increased potential to outperform. It should be noted as well that when calculating something like consistent increase you should make sure that the past 12 weeks worth of increase is 20% higher than or equal to the price change for 24 weeks. IMPORTANT NOTE: A jump of over 100% should be considered dangerous because further increase is highly unlikely and such a dramatic increase usually indicates the stock is due for a reversal. 

AUMN meets these requirements. Even after reporting a 4Q loss and slumps on prices for materials like Iron ore, AUMN continues to perform in an upward trend with a projected 25% EPS Growth (F1). 

I bought my shares at .38 with a current aim at .50 for about a 31% profit. Will it make me a millionaire or make me quit my schooling/job? Hell no, but I'm currently expecting to make an extra $1,000 or so which trumps throwing darts in the dark like I see so many of you do on this sub-reddit. Not to mention this is just one of my current 10 investments, and one of the smaller ones at that. 

So there. Get owned random stranger, I sure wasted time better spent studying- I mean- I sure showed you! This single post is more than I have ever posted since I've even joined this site. I will now return to never talking and silent judgements of strangers. Good luck to everyone in their endevors, I wholeheartedly wish you the best!

What troubles me is that they had to know this would be a point of contention. If I had a real phone and really cared about the share price, I would have gone the extra ~~mile~~ 10 yards to put naysayers to rest.

Morsyn;"Yep, this is exactly what I expected to happen. Like you, I was hoping it be a real broadcasted presentation of a phone where they actually demonstrate the functionalities in a live format. Not an edited visualization of a ""phone"" that literally anyone could have drawn. Pretty sketchy. The only question is, will it cause an artificial pump for tomorrow. From what I'm reading, people are trying to shill and hype it like crazy across boards such as iHub. Typically, there isn't much money flow here, but do they actually believe their own hype? If so, we could see a nice pump. If anyone is looking to play it past tomorrow I'd recommend to stay the hell away, there's better and safer players, imo.

Novartis rivals Pfizer, and thats the kind of expert knowledge you want, a value driver so to speak. 
And the one of the reasons I suspect J.Wallace hasn't committed to a deal yet, is because I suspect hes trying to leverage a higher premium for co., given that pharmaceutical partnerships are based on a tier system thats relative to which phase of clinical trials its in, as I learned from the article.

tacopwnsyou;"I don't have enough experience with stock investing, biotech, or insider trading in general with relevant examples, but if I may share my take maybe this can help you or you can educate me if I'm way off the mark.  First off, I googled ""SEDI reports ceo short selling"" without finding too much information suggesting this isn't super common?  Some folks have suggested that this was a way to leverage the cash to commit to buying options.  So short selling a stock as CEO if you had material info that the company was in bad shape but hadn't released that would be illegal insider trading.  Dan Legault is smarter than that.  Second, he doesn't get paid very highly as a CEO as this is not a Bayer or Pfizer... yet, I hope.  I heard he makes around 140k a year.  As such, he might not be sitting on a giant pile of cash with which to exercise options, so he may have spoken to a broker/lawyer and it was suggested to short sell 500k shares to raise the money to execute options which could be sold to close the short position.  The options are probably in the money as compared to the shares sold short, so he would end up with a net profit by doing this, and the company will end up with money it perhaps needs to complete phase 2b July efficacy study.  Finally, aside from the illegality of having done this if he had material info that the company would fail, he would be fired instantly if this were simply a trade against the company.  It would place the sitting ceo at a conflict of interest for the betterment and success of the company and the board would have him gone in 10 minutes.  This, then, must be a calculated move and almost certainly will be followed by an exercise of options/warrants giving the company yet another cash boost.";1523847098;dxfn3ru;t3_8bm3sd;3

tacopwnsyou;Again, I'd like to cite my lack of experience first.  I've done a shitload of research on this company, however I am not a medical professional or expert otherwise.  I think this company honestly only has a couple possible directions, and it may be about a coin flip probability at this point.  However, having a 50% probability of success is about as good as its going to get in pharma/biotech where once anything is approved sp is going to skyrocket.  It comes down to risk/reward and the overall probabilities in the industry.  Risk is about 85% downside potential imo, they have Citagenix which is slated to soon become profitable and has annual income of 9M already.  They expect it to grow to 50M in the future.  That alone values them at the share price it is today, only you'd see huge downside if the drug side failed, probably want to panic jump off, and it'd shoot lower than true value imo, then come back up as Citagenix increased in value.  That could take years just to earn your money back and there would be better plays in the meantime frankly.  Only thing is, if the drug side fails, the drop will be sharp and fast.  Now to the upside, significantly higher than 85% upside potential.  I am personally hoping for a partnership leading to long term success rather than a buyout.  A buyout must be valued with all the risks built in, so a pre phase 3 buyout wouldn't pass 1.5-2B imo.  Company knows drug is worth that though, so I also don't see them settling for less.  I think its more likely they partner, and if they partner, pass phase 3, pass fda approval, and get a drug on the shelf..... the sky is literally the limit.  I would expect company value to be in billions which is 10x+ what it is today.  1000%+ upside potential vs. 85% downside potential and odds perhaps as good as a coin flip?  That being said, this is the extremely rare opportunity of a penny stock being a long hold for any of this to be realized.  All of this will take years, I think drug on the shelf or rather prescribed is earliest 2020.  Buyout could happen too, however, and would cause an instant payday of I'd say at least 400% to today's share price but possibly significantly higher.  Worth mentioning is the change of phrasing in their latest April 2018 investor presentation where they added language suggesting a buyout was possible.  It previously said strategic partnership I believe, and now mentions both as possibilities.;1523856118;dxftz6b;t3_8bm3sd;3
triggeringsjws247;Did you mention that they hadn't passed P2B yet? Or did they only pass one primary endpoint and have to prove efficacy now? Where can I get the latest clinical info?

tacopwnsyou;"The phase 2b study appears to actually have two parts.  Why it isn't phase 2b and 2c is beyond me.  Phase 2b results came out but now in the latter portion of phase 2b they will be testing 250mg and several lower doses.  This will begin probably Q3 2018 with results Q4 2018.  Earliest we could really start phase 3 seems to be Q1 2019.  This drug is still a long ways away, but if and as it clears hurdles the sp will reflect any derisking associated.

Their most recent investor slide is a great place to start, then there are a bunch of news releases related to the studies but those are always just a couple paragraphs.  Still informative and if you read them chronologically they show the direction they've gone.

Also maybe worth checking out is the Zacks Small Cap Research report, which is worth looking at despite being paid for.  You can always verify the information and check out the science if you're good enough.  Worth noting is that most H2S NSAID papers have Wallace, the CSO of Antibe, as an author.  Its hard to find other information.  That being said, if Wallace thought this drug was a bust why has he spent his entire adult life developing it?

WonkyWombat321;"Well saying it's up 150% in the last 30 days is far from accurate since less than a few thousand shares have been traded under .0025. I had a bid in at those levels which never filled. Most fills were going through between .0028 and .0030 the last 30 days so saying it's up 100% is fair. But what's your point? Are you arguing it's not undervalued anymore at a $10m market cap ($2.5m float)? 

While I'd like to see more profitability from the company this year I would argue it's still pretty severely undervalued, but that's just one mans perspective. I like a company that continues to grow year over year and I don't mind holding long until they hit $100m in revenue. ";1523542715;dx8rtt2;t3_8bnd88;1

Since then they have submitted a plan to the SEC which was accepted in order to regain compliance which extended their deadline quite far! They have until December 2019 I believe!

It is my concern that stem to T cell could cause this if the stem to t cell system cannot be controlled.  It would be i teresting to see what happens when put in a preclinical setting, ie cynologous monkey.  I do work for a biotech myself and I work within a cell bio/immuno lab.

That money would be taxed the same as your capital gains. There's a misconception that it's taxed higher because it's short term. The real answer is that you just don't get the discount for holding it for a year. That's the better way to look at it. ";1523798312;dxeeh3o;t3_8c717o;6
WordSlinger81;"Exactly, my biggest profit this year was from a stock I held for 2 hours. Meanwhile I still see people pumping IFXY on twitter because they sunk 10K+ into it months ago when it was trading at .009 and are still hoping for that mythical ""moonshot""";1523800422;dxefvtr;t3_8c717o;6
TheThunderhawk;If you’re needing money, you shouldn’t be fucking around with this stuff. In terms of turning a guaranteed profit you’re probably better off robbing a bank or something.;1523805923;dxekdm1;t3_8c717o;5
PostMaloy;"I’ll tell you a story because you’ve uttered words I said when I started and let me give you advice.

You. Are. Not. Better. Than. The. Market. 

Everyone thinks they are “pretty smart so they can do it”

Regardless of if you’re actually smart general intelligence will not make up for experience and emotional control you need to be successful at this.

I was naive too, I’m not judging you- I literally said the same words you just said and I lost 10 grand, all of my savings. Do I regret it, no. I regret not hammering into my head before I started that I need to know what I’m doing before I start. 

If you can trade with a realistic amount of fake money(start with 1000, because that’s more realistic to what you would start with real money with- not 100grand)successfully for 2 weeks without basing it on getting lucky, then you put real money in because at that point you’ve proven on some level you know a little bit about trading.

Let me tell you not to worry about missing out because I know you’re goin to say “I don’t want to miss out on the trades with real money for 2 weeks”.

Listen- there will ALWAYS be trades. You’re goal is to learn how to be at the right stock at the right time and to get in, and get out. Take the 40$ profit because I KNOW you wanna hold it until it reaches $100- “just a minute longer then I’m out” and that’s how you lose your money. It’s a marathon- take the small wins over hoping for big ones. Control yourself and you I’ll do fine- wish I knew these things when I started.

Also fuck trying to avoid Pattern Day Trader rule. If you can’t have the patience and control to put all your effor into 3 high quality trades per week, you won’t make it. If I had stuck to 3 trades per week, I would still have that money. Good luck and I will gladly do my best to answer your questions.";1523811889;dxepye7;t3_8c717o;2
PostMaloy;Also understand when you put real money in, it’s the most thrilling moment of your life- don’t get addicted to the high you’re going to fill. It’s exhilarating when you get in to a stock and you’re up 100$ - you’ve got to look over that feeling and remain logical;1523812067;dxeq4tl;t3_8c717o;2
Thieflord2;"Yeah I highly recommend starting with trading on paper and learning about the risks and what not.  


As for taxes, if you trade in an Individual Investment account, you must pay taxes in one of two ways on your GAINS.  


1)  Capital gains.   You hold a position for longer than a year, and then you sell for a profit.  This is taxed as CAPITAL GAINS TAX.


2)  Regular income.  You make a profit on a trade in a time period less than one year of holding.  This is taxed just like any other jobs income, and falls into your corresponding tax bracket.  I can help you learn more about that if you want to talk further on what that means, as for many individuals there are tax advantaged options that might benefit you.


I won't pretend I have been a trader all my life but my father has been a very successful trader for much of his life, and the wisest advice he ever gave me about investing and trading is this;   ""Never be in a position where you are NEED to make money on your investments or trades.  Trades just seem to do better when you don't need the money to survive.  They do even better when you don't need the money at all.""  Its all about the psychology of trading just as much as the mathematics and logic behind it.


Good luck and stay financially safe buddy.

romankostan;"It's a solid read, Timothy Sykes lessons are incredibly unorganized so basically Jamil (The Author) took Tim's education and organized it through a book. I remember google Timothy Sykes years ago and came across a reddit post on this subreddit and it dissuaded me from seeking the right knowledge when in fact Tim's dvd's, lessons and now this book is solid knowledge and you can easily make a living from it if you follow it to the letter. 

Pennystocks are really unpopular because people who go to school for finance and waste a ridiculous amount of money on these diplomas and degrees are taught that pennystocks are worthless which is correct. They are called pennystocks for a reason but they also volatile which is great to make money.

I actually caught a youtuber, a mainstream trader out of Britain who holds conferences letting people know that these ""Make $3000 in a day"" educational packages like Timothy Sykes dvd's were a scam because that would require a volatile market but that's exactly what pennystocks are. So you have this guy getting hundreds of thousands of views and giving bad information to people who could be making a living on pennystocking while he's trades forex.

enigmanonymous;I’m considering grabbing a few shares of HMNY, but I just saw their new subscription model of 4 movies a month for $30 every three months. This is a very risky move, speculating on the retention of their current subscribers and their ability to reel in new ones. I know they already have a significant base and plan to use the data and decision influencing as a bargaining chip for the film industry,  as well as play the distribution game, but I’m not sure if any of this is sustainable given the timeline they are on and the introduction of this model now.

zimzambIe;This ATM news blindsided me idk why they would announce they MIGHT issue shares when their share price is just turning around. My best guess for where the moneys going to go is buying the last 7% ownership of moviepass. Idk wait until Friday and just watch it. As far as their models go that limited one is a short term offer through Iheartradio, it shouldn’t be taken as a sign they’re moving away from unlimited tickets it’s just a limited model because they also get the radio subscription with it. 88% of users are profitable with their current unlimited model ;1524092160;dxlfrr3;t3_8cs7kk;2
enigmanonymous;Yeah, I caught that news and was a little bewildered at why they would be making all of these moves at once. Then I saw the BI article about their auditor's skepticism about their sustainability. I still decided to pick up a few shares to test the waters, since their sustainability has always been questionable and so far the stock has been pretty frenetic, so I'm not too worried about the downturn.;1524098542;dxlm2rd;t3_8cs7kk;1

MyopicTopic;Seems like Farnsworth wants to force a merger of the companies to keep from making an IPO, and is fine with letting the shares dive in the interim. Doesn't work out well for people trying to cash out, but it may be advantageous in a long run--if Moviepass's claims are true. I'm not too sure, but I'd like to recoup my money anyways, so I'm in it for a while longer.;1524157786;dxmv1hw;t3_8cs7kk;1

ckeith7;"Debt is from back in November. Since then, they’ve paid a lot of it off but nobody truly knows how much debt they have until the 10K and Q1 18 come out. 

Truth is is that every tech startup needs to take on a lot of debt if they ever want to grow and become a billion dollar company. No different than AMZN or TSLA";1524071840;dxktf00;t3_8d5lt2;3

Next.";1524115878;dxm1hap;t3_8d5lt2;2
AlligatorRaper;"Expanding on this a bit, the 23 million or about in debt is not exactly as it seems.  First, 19 million came with the old ticker OMVS when Robotic Assisted Devices did a reverse merger with the shell OMVS.  The debt from derivative liabilities comes in the form of convertible debentures (shares of the company at a discount if no repayment). In the following nine months of after the merger, the new OMVS acquired an additional 3 million in debt, mostly convertible debentures ,not too bad for a tech startup. 


What concerns me is that fact that the old shell carried over some much debt. Why would anyone acquire that shell? Also, the shells former owners seem to still have their fingers in the pot and they have a shady past. I think Steve the CEO of rad is a good guy with a great product that stepped in shit with the shell acquisition and is sorting through the mess. 

I've been holding 75,000 shares just waiting for something to happen with the Qs and the 10k. I went from excited to waiting patiently to annoyed. I started to get angry it was taking so long to come out, then I just lost hope and mostly forget about OMVS. I'm still uncertain if this is a good company. There is so much conflicting information and opinions it's hard to see the truth in it all. ";1524144361;dxmgmll;t3_8d5lt2;3
ckeith7;"It is a bit strange. I know Steve got cash up front from Parsons when he moved into OMVS and he has full control of the company. Parsons already has relationships with the lenders and could maybe have made it cheaper for RAD to pay off the notes than it would be for RAD to directly list on the exchange. Also gives Steve more control than if he were to IPO.

Derp2638;You wanna a decent stock. I own a few hundred shares of INTV. It’s a crypto mining company. It’s at $1.05 a share right now. They just doubled their machines. Their earnings date is 5/15(day when profits and revenue is reported). I am a taking a loss currently on it but earnings should be kind of ridiculous for the stock price. It also has a low float. A low float means less shares in public circulation to buy meaning the stock can shoot up and down very quickly.  The last earnings report it almost doubled at one point in time ;1524094554;dxli41g;t3_8d8v0s;3
Derp2638;Finding good stocks can be hard. Also learning how to buy dips takes a bit of time. My suggestion is just do some hard googling. Use yahoo finance people always give info on there and talk of other stocks as well. ;1524094736;dxliabk;t3_8d8v0s;1

Derp2638;Yes a while back they posted something saying with only 30 days worth of mining their rigs earned 100k ish numbers. This was on the last report.  I believe for the last 90 days at least 60 days the machines have been running.  Also you have a definite right to be skeptical. ;1524174488;dxnds1l;t3_8d8v0s;1

Kurdi99;Hi, what is the difference between Nasdaq, NYSE and OTC? Also which platform is good for trading in OTC? If you use understandable language, I`ll appreciate. :);1524201298;dxo0tag;t3_8dkr29;3
DSTAT20;"OTC are usually extremely small companies with small price tags that can't meet the requirements to get on the larger exchanges (yet). They are also less regulated and don't provide as much information as a blue chip (nasdaq, s&amp;p, dow) stock would.

Forgot to add that I use tdameritrade to trade otcs. There are plenty of brokerage accounts that offer them, but they usually require you to pay commissions.";1524224417;dxoc3fz;t3_8dkr29;3
dirtywiggle;I use etrade because they are easily the fastest but TD has 500 free trades and I use thinkorswim still as my main platform;1524230539;dxogqf3;t3_8dkr29;1
dirtywiggle;NASDAQ is is subject to regulations on reporting their financials and if they go up to fast, they can be halted for a few minutes. OTC is smaller and usually more thinly traded commonly thought of as high risk high reward. No regulations on these companies and they do not trade aftermarket;1524230638;dxogtlc;t3_8dkr29;1

Some great consolidation between .18-.20 the last week. This thing is really prepping for the next leg up beautifully! Accumulation is steady as they come and RSI is hovering mid 50s I believe giving this plenty of room to run above 20 before they release their 10Q by May 15th.

Won’t be much holding this back up to .40 come mid May when the news drops. No fluff PRs here from the company - you’re in before the news drops, or you’re chasing on the way up when it’s too late

UgliestFox;Lol. Did you even read my post? I made a 10c/ share profit and sold.

RobertGills;Theres a few others that are a lot better;1524726755;dxznshf;t3_8eu0dg;1
UgliestFox;They're in a compliance period, needs to be above 0.20 average for 30 days prior to some time in May (brain is asleep still, don't know actual date). If you look at the 5-day chart it won't really tell you but the 3 or 1-month will. There's like ~34% institutional ownership and significant inside ownership. I can't imagine either letting this fall below 0.20 without a fight. And if you look at the 2-day you can see it's been tested very hard. The earnings are expected between -0.04 and -0.03 continuing w/ the right trend for a company currently only marketing one OTC product. To be clear, I'm gambling on it but I have a lot of hope for the long term.;1524740718;dxztxek;t3_8eu0dg;1
Mr-Pickles-123;"Good point with the .20 support barrier. 

With regards to earnings I’m not very hopeful.  I don’t think the EPS numbers itself are going to move the needle, since everybody seems to be holding for the sake of a future partnership or a completed trial. 

Now, if they say some kind of juicy “business development” on the call then all bets are off. We will see. I’m still holding also.

A true investor turns 1000 into 100000 over the course of 5-10 years thru safe investments. It doesnt matter what you start with, only that you remain consistent. You can gamble some small funds but no one gambles their saving if they have any sense. This shit is not rocket science. Its just not that hard.;1524963903;dy537hl;t3_8eu5i9;2

AGNReixis;"Theres an old scenario that was told to me by somebody I respect. It was the idea that you can bring together 50000 people. Tell them you can accurately predict the stock movements 10 days in a row. Tell half that itll go down, and half that itll go up. Then of those who were correct, split them again, telling half it will go up, and half it will go down. Do this 10 times in a row, where you keep splitting the group in half. At the end of the 10 days, you will have convinced 50 people you can predict the stocks with 100% accuracy. 

The point im trying to make, is as I pointed out on your other post, you made 5 calls. Of those 5 calls, only 1 succeeded, AXXA. You now offer the same call, plus an additional failed call from that set, plus two additional new calls. 

AXXA is unstable, and has terrible volume and a very bad RSI.

UHLN had 3 good days, but is severely overbought, and will crash tomorrow. The candlesticks are evidence of that even without taking RSI into consideration.

IFXY is an overbought breakout. They went up because they had announced signing on with 2 new ICOs. I would look for confirmation before you buy. If tomorrow they are red, don't buy. Forget it. I wouldn't have high hopes.

BRKK is also overbought, with no news. Hard to tell yet if this is a correction or a pump and dump. Ultimately, all of them look like targets of pump and dumps.

I believe those were people who were holding shares under the original ticker before it changed on the 18th. They still cannot sell from what I understand which is partially what it fueling this mad run. I suspect the price will crash once they finally transfer over.

Clitoriserator;"It seems sketchy but every CEO sells shares at some point. Tim Cook from Apple sold a ton of shares in 2016. Does that mean he isn't confident in Apple's future? No, he sold shares to get money. Simple as that. In the end lots of CEO's sell shares and it doesn't mean they don't have faith in the company. Now if a CEO sold all the shares they own I would be little worried but not too much.

This being said I too was worried many months back when I saw a CEO from a different company sell a ton of the shares they own. So I looked up some stuff online about CEO selling shares. I do not remember clearly but I think lots of times a CEO has to plan ahead of time when to sell their shares. So it may just be that the CEO decided a while back to sell some shares at this time with no secret meaning to it besides just wanting some extra cash. 

Not to mention he is the CEO so I am certain he will be rewarded with more shares at some point. Especially if the company does well. ";1525291321;dycd6af;t3_8g949y;4

Post I made a little while back. GLFH - check it out. I posted some DD in there. It’s realllllly been picking up momentum and people are playing games and setting up walls (real and today a fake 2.5k wall from ETRF *of all MMs* that was hit for like 200k shares). 

It’s hovering at .2399 I think right now. This thing trades on air and we are all waiting for the 10Q to pop out. This isn’t a “let’s make 100% every day” stock. This is a load up and hold for the heat stock - something very RARE in the stinky pinks. Just check the chart, but most importantly check their filings. It’s all there.

Yamate;Hey man we’ve all been there - penny stocks are volatile both ways so you can make and lose money easily. I’d suggest you use ameritrade to trade paper money. It is likely you’re inexperienced and trading without set limits paired with limited research. There are tons of resources out there with a quick google or YouTube search but if you want to just jump into it, trade paper money and see how well you do without the risk of losing actual money. If you can remain positive over the course of a few months you might be able to trade real money and make a profit. There are a few apps like Stash and Acorns if you want to ease into investment without much risk. The two apps also do a decent job of teaching investment in sizeable bites. I’ve got referral bonuses for RobinHood, Stash, and Acorns if you or anyone else want one.  Good luck out there man. ;1525449591;dyg08xz;t3_8gyhgo;2

talleyreviews;"It's pretty simple to get started.  That's actually the easy part.  The hard part is not losing money.
Opening a brokerage account is like opening a checking account.  It can be done online by providing certain personal info.  Sometimes they may request proof of identity which can be achieved by sending in documents via mail or fax or answering certain questions via phone.

Before you choose a brokerage I suggest you figure out what style of investment appeals to you the most.  

Day Traders want returns immediately 

Swing Traders want returns days, weeks, sometimes months later.

Long term Investors want returns years or decades later.  

It's not about how much money you want to invest in stocks as much as it's about how much money you're willing to lose in stocks.  Once you have that amount in mind understand that certain investment strategies or stocks may not work with the amount of money that you're willing to invest.

topper12g;Open up a TD Ameritrade account and practice with a paper account through think or swim. There is a difference between investing and trading... penny stocks are traded and while they are “invested” in they rarely pan out. Before you spend YOUR hard earned money you should practice with simulators. Being profitable trading penny stocks is for professionals who spend 40+ hours a week treating trading like it’s their job, because it is. It is not easy and penny stocks don’t follow technical and fundamental patterns which makes them much more risky to trade. If you are serious about trading or investing and managing your own wealth than you need to treat it as a second job. It’s very serious business. I have been learning and teaching myself for a little over a year and I am still not profitable but I am making better decisions. I am serious about and work everyday to improve myself.  ;1525650909;dyk6p8a;t3_8hgkwa;6

DoccSampson;"Ok, noob here as well, so let me give you some very general advice that I should have waited to hear before diving in. 

Penny stocks are volatile and hard to predict. They're not like regular stocks that you are going to watch over a period of time and then jump in when the time is right. The movement in penny stocks lasts maybe a week, then it tanks and it's usually done for a long time. 

There are online forums in which the participants talk about penny stocks that are on the rise. *HGVA .21 up 30% in first day. Load!* However, almost always, this is well after the fact that they've already been rising for some time, and you're likely too late. By that time, you'll buy in and suddenly the value will start to drop back to it's pre-surge prices.

This happens over and over for new penny stock investors and it feels real shitty, man. Inner monologue: ""Wow, this stock has been rising since 9:30 am, and it's up 21.9% for the day! If I had invested 1000$ at the beginning I'd have made 200$ by now. I better jump in now. What are the odds that it's going to start dropping right when I get in?"" To answer your hypothetical question to yourself that I just made up, most likely it's going to start dropping within a few hours, to one day after you buy in, and you're going to lose a bunch of money before you finally give up on that stock and sell what you have to cut your losses.

So clearly you're going to want to do lots and lots of research before you invest in a shaky penny stock. And it seems the criteria for knowing when a penny stock is about to move is a lot different then what you would find with a traditional stock.

Now, take this part with a grain of salt because I am a noob also and just now beginning to understand it: those who do well in trading penny stocks have at minimum Level 2 stock information. They can see when big market movers are preparing to / are loading a particular stock. As far as I can tell, any way to get access level 2 and 3 stock information will require you to buy stock market analysis tools/software.  TDAmeritrade, etc. 

My advice would be to establish an account with a broker, and get some money moved into that account from your bank account. But don't do anything with the money. Just make sure that it's in the chamber ready for you to pull the trigger when you feel really comfortable with investing. Until then, do all the research you can possibly do, especially about level 2 analysis and software that will help you with your due diligence. 

Even then, you should find a stock simulator or simply do your own analog simulation on a white board/pen and paper. Pick a couple stocks you think you've got a bead on and (honestly) choose a price and number of shares at which you will buy in and sell out. See how reliable your instincts and supposed knowledge really are. They make an app called Stock Trainer for your phone that is good for this. Run a minimum of a hundred simulations, which shouldn't be difficult because you won't be ready to dive in for a real for at LEAST 8 months. 

*Disclaimer: I'm fairly new and none of the advice above should be taken at face value. These are my observations over the course of the past year or so. DO YOUR RESEARCH. ";1525686077;dyktkd9;t3_8hgkwa;4
mxxy69;I wouldn't recommend penny stocks. However, if you're going to try it anyways, at the very minimum, please know what a pump and dump is. In my opinion, I feel like penny stocks are mostly just that.;1525695735;dykyfr2;t3_8hgkwa;2

farfalilly;I started with Robinhood and got the feel of things where everything is free.  After about 6 months, when I'd learned a bit about volume, limits, puts, calls, etc, and what to look for in stock research, it started getting frustrating that Robinhood is so limited. I opened an account with Fidelity a couple months ago and am liking that. By no means am I a professional, stilll a total newbie, but I haven't had any big losses yet, everything is green this morning. Robinhood feels like preschool for trading, great place to start. Penny stocks are a lot of fun, but treat it like Vegas- especially while you're learning only invest what you are comfortable losing. If you want to really invest instead of playing the game, from my limited knowledge ETFs seem to be the way to go. I'm using Fidelity for that as well now, but I started with Stash- super simple, free, and walks you through everything. Stash taught me that it's wise to watch and change the 401 investments (401 has always been through Fidelity), and now I'm higher in the green in that account than I ever have been! ;1525705871;dyl73eb;t3_8hgkwa;3
hazenfelts;"Not yet but I haven't been looking particularly hard.

farfalilly;"Another good bit to add to this is the 8% rule. A friend (who started with 5k and increased his portfolio by 49k) last year told me this one. Buy your stock and then either be diligent about watching or set a sell limit at 8% above your buy price. Sure enough I would see it rising and make the wrong choice almost every time, ""It'll def rise to 20%!"" Nope. Sell at 2% or let it ride for the next two months. Don't get greedy, take the 8% and move on- it's a nice profit! Now that I'm doing this I'm actually making money. Lol, I had to learn for myself to ignore the excitement and be practical.";1525706484;dyl7poj;t3_8hgkwa;3

Saints420Fan;"Honest opinion - the company (IVS) that’s over seeing the merge in process - tweets the progress of the entire thing and has generated  a boat load of interest. It was trading .009-.012 when you were posting last. 

Today it was sitting around .0175 with news, which I was expecting. They announced Wednesday they would give us more news . This thing should run over .02+ with news Wednesday of the company merging in.  I’d expect a decent buying opportunity Monday-Tuesday when there’s no news - just saying. 

With mergers there doesn’t always need to be a great match. It’ll run with hype to a point either way. But this seems to be a good hold

dirtywiggle;"Just finished healthcare schooling and honestly wanted to see. I just wanted news which I knew would move it which happened. Here it is though the process on pre-submission for medical devices which it is. I knew the drug approval process but not medical devices. Kind of a fun read https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm311176.pdf 

Edit: page 12 and then 35 for the details. As punishment invest 50 dollars into BIEL
";1526046967;dyt6982;t3_8inqp2;1
houseflip;"i'm aware there is a real pre\-submission program that companies can go through. it's completely voluntary and not necessarily needed for approval of the product. you can meet with the fda before they actually put a decision on your product.

but i'm saying there is no such thing as a ""pre\-submission approval"" as BIEL worded it in today's PR. there is indeed a ""pre\-market approval/PMA"", but that is very different and BIEL would have said that because it is hard to obtain. but that pdf does not mention a ""pre\-submission approval"" or any ""denial"" process during the pre\-submission. i think biel simply got more info from the fda meeting and that is it!

houseflip;Please copy and paste where it says anything bout a DECISION to approve or deny a pre\-submission. all im saying is NO DECISIONS are made during these pre\-submission. they are guidance meetings imo. i know there are pre\-subs. but they are meetings imo. i can't find anyting that says a yes/no/approval/denial is decided during the pre\-sub. biel has a pre\-sub for the 510k medical device application. the 510k device decision is the only approval/denial they can ever get. pre\-sub is nothing imo.;1526047806;dyt73qq;t3_8inqp2;0
dirtywiggle;"Yeah shitty pumping for sure and trying to take it out of context definitely. Finally found what this whole thing means. This whole thing was fun. Approval is a thing but it is definitely much to do about nothing. 

""Because FDA approval of an IDE is not required to conduct clinical studies of NSR or exempt
diagnostic devices, or for studies located OUS, FDA is generally not involved in evaluation of
the protocols. In these cases, applicants will generally have limited opportunities to interact
with the FDA prior to submission of a marketing application; therefore, an applicant may
choose to submit a Pre-Sub to help identify deficiencies that could preclude approval or
clearance of a future marketing application.""";1526048031;dyt7c0h;t3_8inqp2;1
houseflip;"you're confusing the approvals. that says ""approval of an IDE"" meaning the ""investigational device exemption"" \- that is not a ""pre\-submission approval"" .  that is a different approval. you can apply for IDE approval here. \(its an exemption to use your device in a certain way\) [https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/InvestigationalDeviceExemptionIDE/ucm046706.htm](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/InvestigationalDeviceExemptionIDE/ucm046706.htm) \-\-\-  that excerpt says you can submit a pre\-sub on an IDE....it doesnt say anything about a pre\-sub approval. it says something about an IDE approval";1526048188;dyt7hsi;t3_8inqp2;0
houseflip;"biel isn't going for an IDE approval though, they are going for regular ""510k device approval"" with a new indications/classifications. basically expanding the use of their existing 510k approval. ";1526048428;dyt7r5e;t3_8inqp2;0
dirtywiggle;Just study this stuff. They need an IDE before anything can happen. They need it to get clinical trials to start before it can think about getting the device approved. It is step 1b;1526054210;dyte4tu;t3_8inqp2;1
houseflip;"lol oh boy. this will be my last comment about it but your sorely mistaken and i hope it doesn't cost you money.... they don't need an IDE they aren't going for an IDE. they already received 510k approval for the actipatch last year check the 510k database \(for ONE use, i forget which\). now they are simply going for a second, third, fourth, 20th ""indications"" aka other uses. BIEL never mentioned an IDE. Either way , IDE approval does NOT equal ""pre\-submission approval"" so we're now going back and forth about something completely different.

* The first meeting will take place on May 9th, 2018 to  seek expanded indications for OTC treatment of all musculoskeletal pain for its ActiPatch® medical device.

""expanded indications"" \- its already been approved for one area of the body, they are going for other areas.

You're just making up the biel/IDE and ""its needed before they do trials"" stuff lol. BIEL has never stated this once why did you say this lol? This is sad coming from a healthcare school grad!

Also from the FDA:

* You can submit a Pre\-Sub prior to the submission of an IDE, 510\(k\), PMA, De Novo request, HDE,\(CLIA\) Waiver by Application, 15IND or BLA

IDE and 510k are different

BIEL is going for 510k's as they have been talking about for the last 7 years \- NOT an IDE.

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

And once again my original point was that there is no such thing as a true ""Pre\-Submission Approval"" as today's headline would have you believe. regardless of whether the ""pre\-submission"" was for an IDE, a 510k, or a PMA. Pre\-submissions simply aren't judged by approved/denied/postponed lol \- It appears pre submissions are simply extra meetings with the FDA and upgraded communication abilities...The only approval they got was perhaps a nod they're on the right track of the SUBMISSION process. it was NOT that the device was approved in anyway.

seriously find one other company that got a ""pre\-submission approval"" or even a denial! and double check before you post something because ""pre\-market approval"" is not the same thing. \- \-

\&gt; all i'm saying is that there is no such thing as a ""pre\-submission approval"" or a ""pre\-submission denial"". you won't find one other company or drug developer or device maker that ever heard any type of yes/no decision during the ""pre\-submission"". that's simply all i want to say about today's BIEL headline. that pre\-submission meetings aren't a ""approve or deny"" event.

Looks like some guy from Shark Tank just got involved with the company so I'd expect that $7MM market cap to increase over time. I'd suggest taking 25-50% out now and have some fun, pay off debt, etc., and let the rest ride. At this point it's free money and the upside is much greater than the downside right now.

GreeenKnight;"Open an account with your brokerage / bank and start ""paper trading"" (practice trading) and get a feel for making and losing fake $$$ first.

I really wish I'd have spent some more time doing this.

And while you do that, think about what sort of investor you are. Do you see yourself buying something that you believe in and have put much research into (going long / buy-and-hold strategy)? Or do you see yourself placing trades in the shorter term, following technical signals on charts, etc? 

I'd encourage you to research some companies online (plenty of stock screeners around) and search for them on Twitter. See how active their CEOs are, and try to see if real people (not just bots and shit) are following them and pay attention to what they are saying about these companies (some will be sharing news, some will share charts, etc). You'll start finding some genuine folks &amp; also those who want to deceive you, especially in pennies... Tread lightly and watch for patterns.

Lots of great resources on Investopedia which will help with getting around the terminology.

But especially if your financial situation is rather precarious (which it is), then I would begin by dipping your feet into paper trading.

You can also hit me up on Twitter here, and I am happy to chat via DM...  @thegreeenknight (notice the three ""e's"").

humbletradesman;"No not at all, I think it’s good that you got the thought to invest and do something with your money to try to grow it. What I was saying was that penny stocks aren’t necessarily the best thing to start with.. they are mostly scams (regardless of the hopes and dreams people will try to sell you regarding any particular ticker/company being pumped here on Reddit or elsewhere) and you can lose all of your money very, very quickly. They seem lucrative at first glance because they’re so ‘cheap’, but there’s a reason they’re cheap.

Jokes aside, you wanna do some reading (investopedia is a great resource to start with) and understand the basics of how the market works, how to read charts, etc... and just start watching and keeping an eye on the markets and some stocks of your choice (use an app like Yahoo finance for example). You also wanna figure out if you want to TRADE or INVEST (there’s a big difference and you can google around to find out)... and then develop your knowledge based on that.

You can also do ‘paper trading’ which is basically trading real stocks with fake money. There are a few apps for this and if you open a brokerage account with TD ameritrade (don’t even need to deposit anything or just a few dollars), you can use their infamous ‘thinkorswim’ platform that a lot of experienced traders like to use and it allows you to log-in to ‘paper trade’ and you can trade to your heart’s content without losing real money. This is how you can learn how everything works and what making/losing money with trading can potentially look like.

Once you understand the basics.. you can start to carefully play with some of your real money and try to slowly build it up. Best wishes for you man and hope to see some success stories from you posted here in the future!

P.S. check out some other investing/stock related subs on Reddit and read up there also, don’t limit yourself to this sub only.

vytasmike;"That is great answer from beetfrace. As well you need to contact more brokers and advisers to help you sell it or at least point in the direction what you should do to sell it. 

As well you can try to sell it to the company's insiders if it is possible, because insiders from time to time buy their own stock for various purposes.

As well ask maybe someone in charge from your company if there is investor who is interested in company's stock sertificates.

It probably will not be so easy to get rid of this stock certificate while this is real OTC and you need to find willing buyer by yourself or with the help from intermediaries.

But in order to sell something you need to make offer to as many possible prospects as possible to sell it, there is no other way around.

Forgetfulcunt;I think it's also helpful to know that there are timing strategies as well. i.e. mornings and power hour where you should probably be doing most of your trading for penny stocks, because that'll be the best volatility, and most liquid if you need to get out of the stock. Which is almost every time, unless you have a long position over a long period of time. You'll probably just get grey hair/ grow old by the time you'd be able to sell at a break even price anyways.;1532964337;e3alnrg;t3_8jemqm;1

Trump and Co. have already clearly stated that they will not hinder the MJ industry, I personally look forward to the legalization of MJ from the Trump administration, there's too much money to be made in it to ignore, and it would clench his re-election. ;1526593800;dz5k9uu;t3_8k2gwn;1

IntrepidBlock;"Well, I certainly wasn’t thinking the day was going to end like it did. MM’s were hiding buys in the afternoon and reported them as a t trade. I have a hard time believing that it will go lower than it is, and so that’s why I think now is the best time to get in for people who weren’t following when I started posting about it at .035/.04. Then again I thought it would bounce from around .07 too. This should be at support now though looking at the chart, and it closed above to 20DMA. Might have to churn / trade sideways for a bit from here, if no news comes. There’s several possibilities for news though that could spark another run.

Saints420Fan;"Jeesh I posted a reddit topic on MGON when it was trading .009 and I got crapped on saying t was worthless last week lol. Glad to see a warmer reception on this. 

Yeah MSMY and WUHN both went up 2000+%

Now the share structure for MGON was released by IVS and is said to have a ***SUB 100 MIL FLOAT***

Low floaters can run VERY high and very fast - like double digits fast. Now a trending sector would be great for this like Blockchain, weed, Oil &amp; Gas, etc. I think the most important thing is just a profitable company. Seeing IVS’s track record - I think we are in good shape here!

I’d be getting in tomorrow and enjoy the ride - IVS is clearly sitting on the info and just WAITING to release it. Will do it during market hours imo (although this is not a definite!). I think the implications of this stock going parabolic on hype alone is VERY REAL. But as stated, throw in a good company and it’s a goldmine like WUHN.

To the guy who mentioned 150$ - sounds like a decent lotto ticket’s worth to me, and with better odds ha!

However, now that there's an immediate catalyst it makes it a lot more affordable, in the sense of timeliness, to take action. Thanks for the info. =);1527027777;dzeuixg;t3_8lc5m9;2
Saints420Fan;"On the contrary, I WAS the lucky one for getting in early lol. 90% of the time they would be right. I shoulda posted more DD and maybe it woulda been perceived better? No worries either way. We are here now and the good news is - the party hasn’t even started yet! 

I hope that one guy trolling is still following it. When i trolled him back after it exploded he got a little cranky and said something about climbing Everest. Hopefully he wasn’t jumping off any cliffs after feeling the remorse of missing out on gains (I kid!) 

Just here to make money folks, I’ll share any DD I have along the way. I can’t make money without other people making money with me. We all gotta slap the ask ha

Arcaro plays sometimes get a little cold (See LRDR) because of the lack of news - when in reality LRDR is in fact Joe’s next custodianship nearing or something? He just terminated custodianship with CYPE or AXMP if I’m not mistaken - I forget which cause there’s just so damn many! Not to thread hijack but I have some cash in LRDR also and it should spike soon enough since Joe should be going there next to finish it up.

Boots-n-Bell;Yeah I’d hold longer. For a few weeks. I just wanted some profit. Will re enter ;1527110265;dzgtd83;t3_8lc5m9;3
openworked;Strange you would promote this stock and merger but exit right before. ;1527111970;dzgv8g8;t3_8lc5m9;0
RrentTreznor;Thanks for the advice! I've turned $330 into $380 so far today, but this is literally the first stock I've ever invested in, so I have no idea what to expect or when to hold/sell. ;1527112599;dzgvx09;t3_8lc5m9;1
Morsyn;He was taking profits... this is literally the most sensible and intelligent thing you can do in the OTC. You should learn from him. Hell, even I fail to do this many times. The fact that he was transparent about his profit taking was even more commendable. Anytime you have a high amount riding on a stock, you SHOULD take profits. At what increments you do, is entirely up to you, and is what creates the successful trader. I.e. selling 15% of your position every 10% gain, or 20% gain, etc. This is because a stock in the OTC primarily can decrease by over 25% in literally less than a couple minutes. ESPECIALLY in a hype driven stock such as this, which are by far the most dangerous kind of stocks (or crypto if you're into that).;1527114702;dzgy2kc;t3_8lc5m9;1
MrANaanOMus;Thoughts on purchasing now or wait until market opens?;1527114933;dzgyb0y;t3_8lc5m9;1
Saints420Fan;"The news hasn’t officially been dropped yet. Once it does tonight - I am SURE we are going to gap up tomorrow! We closed .0304  and I’m guessing we go straight to .035 and then you can expect to see a couple mil volume within the first 15-30 mins of open - and this thing should fly. All JMHO 

Could def get in at open, and assuming this stays hot, could ride the surge up. Good luck whether you get in or stay out bud ";1527115547;dzgyx1w;t3_8lc5m9;3
Saints420Fan;"Absolutely hold brother! You don’t want to soil your profits with continuous small chunks of profit taking - dilutes your gains with commission fees. Need to make a plan now before open tomorrow - I do this with all stocks whether I’m long on them or if I’m in just for a short ride

Stick to a # with your plan and execute. Don’t let your emotions guide your trading decisions either, just your plan. I personally haven’t sold a single share yet and I’m already up 350%. I usually take a little profits by now personally but I want to maximize these gains knowing there’s going to be a bull rush tomorrow before I entertain selling a piece

At some point tomorrow I’m going to sell just enough to get my entry point back and ride all the free shares. By waiting this long I’ll be able to keep more of my share in than if I sold earlier. Low floater so this could ride up fast!";1527115798;dzgz5xi;t3_8lc5m9;3
Saints420Fan;"It’s going to sky rocket tomorrow with good news pending. Yes All mergers tend to pull a little bit after the initial run - thins the crowd a bit by getting rid of the flippers and day traders just riding merger news. For those who hold and even collect on the dips, stronger hands prosper the most like those 2 did

The most promising thing to key in on is - those are both companies that ran 2000% from pre merger and IVS brought those Frankenstein’s back to life. ";1527116014;dzgzdlu;t3_8lc5m9;2
RrentTreznor;"Thanks so much for explaining your process! I don't fully understand how this penny stock process works. I know that, with an investment in something like Apple, you'd typically want to hold for years at a time, gradually increasing your profits. 

But these penny stocks I don't get. Will the stock eventually fall back down or below the price I originally bought it at? Does the company fizzle out? Or is this the kind of stock you could feasibly hold for years at a time?";1527118860;dzh23ph;t3_8lc5m9;1
Saints420Fan;"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180523006512/en/Megola-Announces-New-Company-Direction

For starters - here’s the bombshell ladies and gentlemen! TV production company - MSMY CEO - going to merge companies. MSMY is on the come up and has been breaking ground. Now they are rallying the troops! 

So about penny stocks though. This is not like big board stocks. You can lose your money faster than you can spit sometimes. Will the price go up forever? Will the price open up at 0.0001 tomorrow, while as infinitely unlikely as it seems it’s anyone’s guess down in stinky pinky land. I would not advise staying in many penny stocks too long (I know his is vague) because of how Volatile they can be. I read SEC filings - look for gems - find a good company in the rough with a good share structure (My current hidden gem in the rough is DLYT - please do your own DD for why - will explode later in 2018-2019 so I’m buying now while it’s cheap). Gotta learn to read filings to and figure out what ever this means. Too much to explain here honestly. 

But to answer your question - I think this company will do great! Is it hold for years to come? Probably not but time will tell. It’s not like the big boards though for sure. Good luck!";1527119205;dzh2fdr;t3_8lc5m9;3
RrentTreznor;Very interesting. Thanks again for taking the time to explain the process to a layman such as myself. As a gambling man, I acknowledge this is definitely dangerous territory, so it's in my best interest to be conservative and tread lightly. I'll do my research on DLYT, though -- thanks for sharing that gem!;1527119494;dzh2oyf;t3_8lc5m9;1
Boots-n-Bell;Haha thanks for having my back. I like to promote stocks that are increasing and people get mad at me sometimes for not being transparent. I was up to 20% gain and took it. Two months of bills in a morning. ;1527120297;dzh3fw9;t3_8lc5m9;1

MyopicTopic;"Yeah, it blows. I called them and I'm set up for pink sheets but even then they won't allow trading, as without financial information they consider it too risky.

So, I'm waiting on E*Trade to link up with my bank account. Already lost out on near 40% gains, but we'll see if I can't get in. Don't wanna try and chase a penny stock though, it's bound to bite me in the ass.";1527124755;dzh801d;t3_8lc5m9;1

RrentTreznor;Quite the drop! Should I still hold?;1527172228;dzi592c;t3_8lc5m9;1
Saints420Fan;"It’s anyone’s guess. Lot of games are being played today! This could shoot up in the afternoon or kiss the dirt. ASCM is a market maker that is soaking up shares so that tells me he either is collecting for the ride back up, or he is covering a short from an olddddddd position. I never seen ASCM on the L2s before 

Not the best news to open to for sure. Do what ever you feel is good my man. This one is moving in volume so people are buying back up, but lot of selling too. Will be interesting to see who wins - the bulls or the bears

1827338989;It did break it today for a second, wouldn’t be surprised to see it come down during PH. This thing moves fast when it starts going with the low float, just a couple walls to get through.;1527092108;dzg8bg2;t3_8ljvug;1

1827338989;The rsi on the daily is at 20. Source: tradingview, barcharts, etc ;1527095373;dzgc61w;t3_8ljvug;2

Builtbyfailure;Wait, so you've bought into this stock because you believe its bottomed and you assume at some point it will make a run. Cool. I like that strategy  better than looking for runners day to day like some people do. I've done that with HMNY. So how do you manage risk? Sorry but if you're feeling generous I've got a few more questions.;1527364133;dzmgv5h;t3_8ljvug;1
1827338989;Yes, the rsi is so low on the weekly chart that the odds of it moving up are greater than it falling more. I pick a specific risk level before entering and if it drops to that price I exit without hesitation to manage risk. Keeps the losses small.;1527378933;dzmu5yn;t3_8ljvug;2
1827338989;HMNY is likely close to a bottom, though, I’d need to see it stay in a tight range for several days to be more confident.;1527379052;dzmu9hg;t3_8ljvug;2

noscaredmoney;You will find all the answers about ACB (aurora) on the sub r/weedstocks;1527127711;dzhb7f3;t3_8lovg6;1
nonameattachedforme;"ACB isn’t really a penny stock, first of all. It is several dollars a share and a multi-billion dollar company with international reach.

That said though, yes, your friend is losing his or her touch. Aurora is on its own level only with Canopy. Canopy is a well-executed company with incredible management. They have beautiful brands, a great strong reach, and they have a ton invested throughout the marijuana ecosystem from health sciences to technology.

Aurora, on the other hand, has been playing catch up to Canopy. In pursuit of reaching their level, they have taken on two of the top three most expensive acquisitions. Firstly, they purchased Cannimed for $1.1B which was a drastic increase over their initial offer and the ongoing market price. Next they’re purchasing MedReleaf for $3.2B, a 34% premium over their market price.

Canopy has still beat them to most major supply deals. Canopy beat them to a NYSE listing. Canopy, frankly, seems to be leading in most areas by executing flawlessly. Aurora is constantly diluting their shareholders through expensive acquisitions.

That’s my two cents. Many will disagree with me (especially from the weedstocks community) but I stand by it. Aurora probably will see nice growth over the next couple months but they’ll still shadow to Canopy.";1527127790;dzhbagf;t3_8lovg6;2

TheCurseOfJamesDolan;"I hate when they keep comparing this to Netflix. They have similar business models, but there is a fatal flaw with MoviePass.

With Netflix, their expenses were relatively set. Especially after the shift from DVDs to streaming.

For example, (these are obviously fake numbers) if Netflix had one user but paid $100 million for their video library, obviously they were losing money. But once they hit ~1 million subscribers, they were about breaking even. And as subscribers grew, they could expand their library while still making a profit.

With Netflix, everyone is sharing from the same pool of content.

But with MoviePass, right now at least, if they have one subscriber paying $8/month and he sees one movie for $10 (at a theater with no deal with MoviePass) they are losing money. If they have a million subscribers they are losing even more money. There isn't a shared pool. Everyone sees their own individual films.

And, if they have subscribers who pay the $10 rate and go to a movie 5-10 times a month (or more) they are losing even more money.

As I see it, at this point, the only way they can make money is if they get subscribers who keep the service but stop going to movies. What percentage of users are going to do that?

Unless they start making more deals with theaters (if they can) and figure out other revenue sources (which it appears they are working on), they are going to bleed money, dilute and the SP will drop.

All that said, I think this certainly does have potential in the future. But I wouldn't buy in now. In all likelihood, you are just going to lose money, at least short-term..";1527134633;dzhhvxh;t3_8lp8e0;7

JackBeTrader;"Not remarkable in any way You're already long biased because of the previous price action and now looking at anything you can through rose glasses to justify your long bias.

It's laughable actually. They are saying that since they know your address, they know your demographics and extrapolate value from there. The data they're referring to is being provided from other sources, not HMNY. A lot of it is public data ie: median income per zip code. Either way it's either free data or something they're paying to get. They're a client of the data companies, not the data company.  If their app is providing GPS data and what not then sure that's something, but there are thousands of apps that do that. Again, not unique or remarkable in any way.

The question is, where's the bottom before we return to the mean?

I mostly trade options these days, and I'm eyeing those Jan 2020 LEAPS, they're relatively cheap and could provide a nice return if rumors pop up about bankruptcy. Hell, a 2020 $0.50 straddle right now is priced so it breaks even if the company goes bankrupt. By 2020, I think it's safe to say that this company will either be bankrupt or worse more than a buck by then.

DerSkagg;"Right now it's in the testing waters, consolidating around the .45 bottom. It'll probably be a while until it grows up to the 1.00 unless something big happens to bring it up. At the rate it's going and those who are investing being the age they are the stock is definitely affected by the media. So it could go either way, it could drop below .5 and stay their until the inevitable, or raise slowly above .5 and continue towards .72 for a consolidation. 


I've been selling LEAP PUTS for two reasons on this stock. 


1) Confidence surrounding it is low and premiums are high, Leap Premiums aren't as widely affected by the daily swings.


2) The company is approaching a turning point in it's steep decline where I believe it'll consolidate above .5 and if it doesn't the stock won't fall low enough that I can't turn it around in the event I'm selected. (If it crumbles, I'm only out 30% instead of 100%)";1527727987;dzusgrh;t3_8n9xfp;2

Derp2638;SMRT~ is Stein Mart a clothing retailer. The niche is basically selling expensive brands for cheap buying other stores overstock and such. These expensive brands you can get for basically 20% off normal price. Q4 conference call new president said they would cut corporate staff, fix their website(pretty good website) with now ecommerce delivery to stores. As well as cut down on bad inventory I believe by 15%.  This was significant. I work retail. Cutting bad inventory is no joke it can flip a store’s sales.  SMRT recently reported 16 cents eps and has sense rebounded from their recent lows.  In addition to this if you are long. Like super long I’m sure with in the next year they might reinstate their dividend ;1527852602;dzxnebz;t3_8nj8ck;1

jtmathis42477;"http://markets.ask.com/ask/news/read/36402003/tgi_announces_share_buyback_program

Here is the link. In the pr, it states that they will be buying back share at both market value and negotiated prices. So it could be even be more shares than that. It also says this will take place over time, so I imagine they'll either retire all the shares at the end of the buyback or at multiple times throughout the process. I think of a buyback in terms of a math equation .. PPS x OS = Market cap. Now that is basic but for this it will apply. So if the pps goes up then the market cap increases. If the OS goes up and the market cap stays the same ( aka dilution ) the pps goes down. But if the OS goes down and the market cap stays the same, the pps proportionally will shift to keep the equation even. Did that make sense? Its like a sliding bar with the OS and PPS. Idk it helped me maybe itll help you. So Yes. Not only will the buying pressure and volume be affected positively throughout the process, on the day of the retirement of shares, the graph will shift proportionally concerning how many shares were retired.";1527890754;dzyqx51;t3_8nt3jb;1

Velghast;I've been in the security field for about 5 years and currently manage two job sites that use similar vehicles that are gas operated, similar to a gator if you're familiar with them. Electric vehicles are actually very sought-after in this field at the moment but from somebody who routinely is looking for different options for a vehicle Fleet I can tell you that this model looks very bulky. I understand it's a prototype. This company would benefit greatly from having a four-wheeled vehicle instead of 3 that Ops out for an open cage instead of a cab. Mobile security like this is all about just that, Mobility. When you're working Outdoors or in a wide open space having doors on your vehicle can actually impede your work progress, on top of that I have security staff that use a lot of equipment such as radars and have utility belts on that make it cumbersome to get in and out of vehicles with tight spaces. Hands down that's why we always turn to things like off-road vehicles and golf carts they are Speedy reliable and offer comfort and ease of use for many of our officers in the field were vehicle such as a patrol car would be too cumbersome. ;1527956363;dzzyl19;t3_8nt3jb;1

MarcosSmallHands;"Some folks view R/S (Reverse Splits) differently. IMO, I find R/S as ""Stay Away"" for now type of investment. The fear being simply, Dilution. Often in the penny stocks realm, stocks will go through continuous cycles of trying make the Price attractive by reducing your shares. The problem comes when these steps are left on repeat. You lose shares while assuming the risk that the company will finally make the right operational choices to grow. Unfortunately, in many cases the price will fall again and a RS will be back on the table per the boards recommendation. Recently, NSPR just experienced an attempt at a RS. I was lucky to get out the day before. ";1528232198;e066k62;t3_8ou5fy;3
cryptocrud;Wouldn't a person want to wait for the RS, then sell next market open?  e.g.  100 shares bought at 0.50 (last price), RS happens, sell at 1.00?  Or does it gap-dump and people can't sell at the newly inflated price?;1528232871;e067bqm;t3_8ou5fy;1
Boots-n-Bell;No your shares are still worth the exact same amount of money as they were before. The stock price will be higher yes, but you will own a lot less shares. For example on a 10-1 split. Say you hold 100 shares of a $1 stock. After the split you own 10 shares of a $10 stock. So your value of $100 never changed.   R/s are the easiest shorts to make normally. I short most stocks right after a r/s. Definitely any drug companies that do it. ;1528234231;e068u6t;t3_8ou5fy;3
cryptocrud;Ahh.. that makes sense.  ;1528235662;e06adyi;t3_8ou5fy;3
Boots-n-Bell;"I’m not the best at explaining things but I was hoping you would understand. R/S are just very tricky plays. If you haven’t watched stocks that have went through them you should just avoid them til you see how a few affect stocks. GL man! 

My theory is always this. Most people won’t pay $10 for a stock that was $1 the day or month before. Even though the share count is way down and technically the shares are worth that higher price. Most people just can’t get past the eye test of paying that much more per share. That’s why most stocks tend to drop back closer to the price before the restructure. 

And if a R/S being done. There is a reason they can’t keep it above a certain price so that’s already is a big warning sign.  ";1528237313;e06c3wi;t3_8ou5fy;3

MarcosSmallHands;"That's your decision as the investor and if you think management is using the RS appropriately. In my experience gambling with penny stocks, penny traders pump the price until the day before and close their position the day before. 

There have been situations where  the price maintained support at the split price. I believe JAGX currently experience one and has done quite well.";1528295608;e07kep3;t3_8ou5fy;1
Banshay;"I lost a chunk of change on AKERS because I dumped when it announced it pulled its FDA application for chlamydia testing. I don’t regret dumping so much as not waiting a couple days for the price to level some.

AKERS often drops after earnings. Also the founder may be alleging accounting shenanigans IIRC. Add the R/S and no chlamydia FDA and it’s hard to see what the company has going for it beyond its current line of tests, unless ER is really positive. Just selling its current line has the company losing money from what I recall. 

I haven’t followed since FDA withdrawal though so things may be different. ";1528630866;e0ff12j;t3_8ou5fy;1

Edit: there’s some people willing to DM going over failed trades to try to help see the signals why they failed, and to avoid them in the future. 

There are sections for short traders, longs, really volatile swing traders (the shooting stars that go up 100% etc in a day), people that only do longer swing trades, FOREX, I don’t know if anyone does futures, there are OTC and CRYPTO specific areas too. The day trade area is most active, but these guys are serious about it, entrance/exit, if you follow one of their trades do it at your own risk, own your own trade and do not blame someone else if it fails, have a stop loss target before you even enter the trade...

I’m more interested in the longer setups so seeing the patterns form and entrance/exit setups, but I still practice on daily charts trying to “paper trade” if I see a good one.

yugo685;Commissions are a penny for every share over 500 shares and anything under 500 shares is $5 per trade. So if you buy/sell 1500 shares that’ll be $30 in commissions. Not too bad if you’re day trading. If you buy 1500 shares of a stock at $3, you’ll break even at $3.02 and anything beyond that is pure profit.;1529290570;e0uogee;t3_8rv7n6;2

quadulur;Robinhood is great and all but if you are wanting to short stocks or actually daytrade you will have to find other platforms to use and they aren’t all free they have many more perks and more features then RH has though. I believe SureTrader is a broker that doesn’t not require 25k to let you trade as much as you want ;1529295042;e0us239;t3_8rv7n6;2

tacopwnsyou;I think its the fact that so much (majority) of trading is performed by algo's now.  I am not an expert in the OTC/pennystock space, so this might apply mainly to Nasdaq/NYSE listed moreso, but reading books like The Quants, Flash Boys and Dark Pools was eye opening about how much of the markets' trading and liquidity is provided by high frequency operations.  And they pay for server space as close to exchanges as possible and for fiber optic hookups so they can shave trade times down to billionths of a second.  There is no competing as a retail imo on thinly traded stocks if algos are engaged.  Again, though, I can't honestly speak to how much algo's and the firms engaging them give a shit about thinly traded stocks.  I assume when money is on the line and with a plethora of programmers and millionaires worldwide, surely someone has invaded the microcap space w algo trading for profit even if it isn't Goldman Sachs.  You have a better chance on large caps of not being slaughtered because the volume is stupid money every day, but then you obviously don't get as high of volatility and the quick returns.  I think algos have almost killed day trading for the retail investor.  Not completely.;1529555381;e1160tw;t3_8sjuoe;5

Still too complicated for me but if it weren't for him I'd know next to nothing. On this topic he said one time that regular OTC retail orders can often get filled in between spread apparently, but the big hidden blocks that fill like that he always calls darkpools, just like someone else here mentioned.;1529560211;e119ac6;t3_8sjuoe;2

HodlGang_HodlGang;"Can you clarify what you mean when you say there’s 10K shares between the bid and the ask? And also what you mean when you say that volume doesn’t change?

That first part makes no sense, because you’re either on the Bid at 10K or you’re on the Ask at 10K. While technically you can place an order with as many decimal values as allowed by the software, you’ll still end up on either the bid or the ask. Unless you’re placing market orders. 

Volume sitting on the bid and ask doesn’t necessarily reflect demand as not all that volume is being traded. For accurate representation of how many shares are being traded you need to look at share volume, and the Time and Sales log.

These are tools mainly for day and swing traders. Just as not everyone uses indicators and technical analysis, not everyone uses L2 and T&amp;S. To each their own. ";1529598357;e12132n;t3_8sjuoe;2

Hell, the below was even in their most recent SEC filing.


*Going Concern – The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, during the three month period ended March 31, 2018, the Company incurred a net loss of $ $7,586,580 had negative cash flows from operating activities, had a working capital deficit of $8,109,483 and had minimal revenue-generating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. In this regard, management is proposing to raise any necessary additional funds not provided by operations through loans or through additional sales of equity securities. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising this additional capital or in achieving profitable operations. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.*";1529677756;e13yhx3;t3_8st6gy;0

ContrarianHero;"I keep seeing this one on this sub...  I think you guys all really don't understand what this company does.  It's a pure prospecting company.  They own land and/or rights to land that may or may not have accessible lithium deposits.  This company is literally a decade from producing a penny in revenue.  And in the meantime, it will dilute the SHIT out itself raising capital.  Why, you may ask?  Because mining takes so much fucking money to get started.  

It's not at all surprising that the stock hasn't moved despite the drilling news.  You you think they're actually drilling for lithium production in Ollague?  NO!  They're still looking for the lithium!

In buildings that sensitive information is stored, those areas could be shut down to prevent cellphone signals from going out, and monitor who goes in and at what times.

billy-bumbler;"I like this one quite a bit. Also Avita has many patents that seem to predate their one competitor, renovacare.  Additionally renovacare stock price is way over inflated and it does not seem to have even started clinical trials with proper controls, and this seems to be a requirement for Pre Market Approval by the FDA.   Furthermore, the price of Avita Medical Devices is just leaving multiple year low and has been trading approximately horizontal for a while, seems to be a perfect time to jump in. 

I have one question about a source that I cant seem to find right off the bat, relating to what you said here;
&gt;Upon FDA approval, BARDA (US Government Division) will execute the remainder of their contract with them worth $64mm (almost their entire market cap) to stockpile their RECELL devices for future disasters

Only 49.1mm executed on the contract total of $104.8mm. Leaving a remaining balance to be executed of $55.7mm. Their most recent previous filings, conference calls, and press releases all have indicated that they are pushing a lot of funds towards making sure that they can support the demand when FDA approval comes. They have said many times that BARDA will be stockpiling their RECELL devices through that contract upon FDA approval. In fact, they just acquired a manufacturing facility in California to make this happen. I encourage you guys to read their recent filings, press releases, and conference call. Check the ASX market website often too, they post more filings on there for some reason than the OTC website. ";1530287684;e1i5bmr;t3_8u2g2r;2

mirawiel;"no new picks so far. im busy with other things

if i get some nice picks i will post them. nice picks are found maybe once a week. besides that i just go off instincts in the moment

tmrw i will most likely just be looking for dips that look juicy to buy. i put a little money in a dip, then move on and look for another dip.  my bread and butter plan that usually works best for me is buying dips then selling a bit later if it goes in my favor


as for my usual pennystock strategy. my normal plan is to find a pennystock that has made 15% + gains and seems to have high volume and strong movement in either direction. which likely means theres some kind of hype giving the stock life .  then i try to identify where i think the lowest floor of the stock is. the price shouldnt drip beloe the ""floor"" usually

once i identify what i think the lowest ""floor"" is. i throw 100 dollars in when it seems to be trending up. then i wait for it to dip down. when it dips a bit down. i throw in 300 more when it seems the dip is over

then if it dips more. i wait and throw in another 300 when i think that dip is over

if i have correctly judged the ""floor"" of the stock, then the price shouldnt drop below the floor. if it dips to the floor, i put in another 300 dollars and it should climb back to my original buy point. once it gains back, i make money from all lower dips i put money into

thats my usual plan i do if i have no nice picks to work with. the main important / hard part of the method is being right when you judge where the real floor of the stock is. judge wrong and you can get screwed";1530236269;e1h3mfg;t3_8uffdv;2

keep 1000 dollars in PLG as it should slowly rise. as it rises put in slightly more.  and id slowly trade pennystocks using my strategy for now as i think that would make more money than PLG in the longrun

Get out of the game, or stop actively trading. If you are not an experienced and educated trader, actively trading is DANGEROUS. I am an international tax accountant, so I see many of my clients lose 40k+, because they are the children of the Chinese 1&amp;#37; or children of the Indian 1&amp;#37; and they have money to burn. **Don't be that person.**

The safest investing for anyone is putting money into an ETF or mutual fund and letting it ride. Putting money into a Schwab mutual fund or ETF through their website, no fees, no minimum investment into their Schwab funds, set to reinvest dividends automatically might be the best bet. Fidelity is a good company too, but their no fee funds have $2500 minimum. Or, if you like RBH, maybe a Vanguard ETF is a good idea. *I am in no way advertising or affiliated with any of these services for these companies but I am aware of different 401k style options.*

All those questions you need to answer yourself if your intending to hold a penny stock. IMO you shouldn’t hold any penny stock. Too risky. Get in and out and take gains on runs. Always remember when it comes to drug or medical company’s about 1 out of 10,000 ever make it to market. 1 out of 1000 even that enter pre clinical testing.  1 out of 5 that are tested on humans. On average 20 a year. And it takes on average 12 years for a drug to make it to customers. Ones that do are bought up by the big players.

matthewesp;"No, don’t. Don’t pay for anything that involves some guru promising you rags to riches through penny stocks. They make most of their money through marketing to people like you. 

Do this, but the book called The neatest Little guide to investing in the stock market by Jason Kelly. That should run you about $12. Read and study it.

Then open a paper trading account for just $100-$1000. 

Trade and you’ll realize, you can make money pretty fast. But that’s without the realization that your trading with your money. 

Now try with a live account for $100. You’ll make impulsive decisions as all traders have. You’ll lose everything to penny stocks. 

Now you read over the book again. And realize all your errors.

Then you’ll have he knowledge not to focus on penny stocks and realize the fastest way to get rich means the slimmest chances of you succeeding. ";1530426071;e1lamti;t3_8v80hx;17

rethinkdaily;"They’re not all useless. They’re just useless in the beginning. My favorite guy is Tim Sykes. He and his chat room plus alerts have more than paid for themselves. But do not pay for it until you yourself have developed a good understanding of how Kenny Stocks work, and use free resources and like the other commenter said you can also practice paper trading. 

Personally I started reading with real money at the same time I did paper trading. What I did however was whenever I bought a stock with money I also did a paper trade and would do the opposite on paper. 

For example if I sold my shares of real stock, I would hold onto the paper to see what would have happened and to help me not make emotional trades. 

Second thing is this...never trade based on what someone else says, always do your own research and expect to lose your entire investment balance at least a couple times.

Once you feel comfortable, and you can spot potential breakouts and read supports and resistances you can use a guro, again I say Tim Sykes because he does all the trades he talks about and posts it all before market opens and starts with a fresh $5,000 account ever year to prove you don’t need a huge amount of money To start.  But the best thing for me was having s Chatroom where people would alert things.

WAX_ALIEN;You can study charts and $Twitter all day, but it's still just educated gambling. If you come up with an emotionless way to set buys and sells you may see some gains.  Like buy 1000 set the stop loss at -5% so you're out and done with only $50 lost, take that loss and move on. Remember these are penny stocks, these companies are not gonna save the world most of them are fake.  the game is to take advantage of idiots buying on impulse and sometimes you are the idiot.;1530461425;e1lvy3q;t3_8v80hx;2
houseflip;"do not pay for a single thing unless it is live data or news or level 2, which no guru will provide. stop watching the personalities selling memberships and find some people on youtube that simply teach/ramble for no reason - they wont have flashy videos and fake comments praising them but you will learn just as much. ive watched all of those videos you speak of and in general i am just amazed how they can talk for so long, and to an amateur it sounds good, but in reality they aren't saying much of ANYTHING, and repeat the same thing over and over. they are great marketers. not great traders. even the random review websites are fake ( i promise dude, they put out fake review sites that simply talk about their service. can post examples if you need). you will find a ""review"" that by the end, doesnt review them at all, and at the end of the review , there will be a nice affiliate link linking you to the guru in question. affiliate links = every guru's lifeline . and the last thing ill mention to a new trader - even if those guys are great traders, NO ONE CAN MAKE THE SAME EXACT TRADES as them. you will never buy and sell at the same prices as ANYONE else, it is impossible to duplicate another traders trades. even if they posted LIVE every single trade in a text message to you directly, you will NEVER be able to copy their exact/entry exit simply because of how fast the market moves. develop your own strategy. they are selling hopium. all imo.";1530462806;e1lxdlp;t3_8v80hx;1

Full disclosure, I have a small position of 70,000 shares of BIOAQ. As you said, Q plays are risky and I’m skeptical that the commons will survive but I would like to ride this out for a little while. I do believe higher highs are ahead in the short-term at least. ";1530481467;e1mgs7e;t3_8vd2xv;11
billy-bumbler;Yeah Ch11 almost always ends with the common shareholders losing all their value. During restructuring the court gives priority to the debtors, and with 50 million in debt and no history of profitable business seems like this is not going to end well for the shareholders IMO.  If they make a deal with a buy out, the CEOs will take home a nice fat paycheck before there are any deals made for the shareholders, and with this company completely delisted with almost all the institutional owners selling almost all their shares, except one institution who bought 7 million shares in may, I think  they also see the writing on the wall. GLTA;1530543415;e1nqbed;t3_8vd2xv;2
hitalec;I was fairly confident the commons would disappear but this just reaffirms that perspective. Still in currently, but plan to sell sooner rather than later. Definitely didn't intend to hold until the plans are complete. ;1530543922;e1nquzp;t3_8vd2xv;2

I hate having to sell stocks that are doing well, but in some cases, its best to take some of those gains and find something that is looking for a turnaround etc. Once I get above 10&amp;#37; gain, I typically take some profit, if I really like the stock, I sold, I wait for it to come back and buy more.

Guy_fieri98;"Either run top down or bottom up strategies, have had successes with both. 

Bottom up method:

-run equity screener, typically through Bloomberg progression EQS screen, screen based on fundamental metrics:
&gt;market 
&gt;industry
&gt;market cap (less than $100m as they are typically affected by information asymmetry and therefore misssed priced)
&gt;ev/ebitda (less than 5)
&gt;P/e (between 5 and 15)

Look at results, typically less than 50.

-look through results for a potential true undervalued company (low multiples don't as wells mean it's good)

-once a potential opportunity is found then I conduct a more detailed in depth analysis, qualitative and quantitative.

-define as valuation target price via the use of a discount cash flow valuation and comparables valuation, then sensitises to see variation an value and potential returns under both bull and bear cases. 

-If value is present then buy and hold until price target is met or adjust valuation target if variables change.

From what I understand, they don't have financing for phase 3 so they retested on human trials to build public confidence and attract a buyer. I'm no where near an expert on the subject, but even IF everything else about this drug was mediocre (not the case), the fact that it has 1/50th the risk potential of naproxen regarding gastrointestinal damage indicates to me that this drug will be well suited for patients with related GI issues. Fortunately, in their last project update they showed that its pain relief capacity is just as good as other commonly prescribed NSAIDS. You can check it out on their website.

PerfectRectangle;"Fantastic data. By comparing txb2 through various existing studies on naproxen this puts our drug at a level matching at least 880mg daily naproxen in terms of cox suppression. once they publish in their journal and release the detailed data we can make further evaluations and be able to tell for certain what the outcome of the next trial should be.

However at this point based on this we should show at least non inferiority to naproxen which is a 100% win. If they can show a higher reduction in womac again such as the one in 2A this literally changes the whole world in regards to NSAID therapy and its possibilities. If they meet the same level and officially have non inferiority to naproxen it is still a huge win as they've almost completely eliminated side effects.

Kokid3g1;"That's not the reason why this approval is exciting. I'm not bashing you, but your missing the entire ELTP

Elite is one approval away from making (in house) abuse resistant opioids. So getting approvals for making different types of opioids is what Elite has currently been working on.

SequestOx has already been proven to work by the fda themselves. There was a Tmax issue, (how quickly the opioids are delivered into your body) and Elite has resolved this and currently awaiting the fda's approval.

Also, this is in no way the only round in the chamber.

Elite has several big hitters all awaiting approvals, all the while Elite is SEC compliant, no debt, and has revenues.

I'm not trying to sell Elite to anyone here. I'm long, and so not popular among flippers.

To find new companies, think of where you spend your money (Nike, McDonalds, disney maybe) and go to their website to learn about them and read their annual report.

When people list off a bunch stocks they are swing trading I take a look all of them. If I like the price and company outlook then I dive deeper. I check their financials to see if the have debt, look at their past performance see how positive/negative comments are on message boards. Then I look at their last performance and find out why if any they are going. Down or up.

The open comment period on the FDA’s ANPRM ends July 16, 2018. To date, major medical associations, government agencies, tobacco insiders, and the public at large have submitted nearly 3,000 public comments to the FDA. Although some companies in the tobacco industry have requested a 90-day extension of the comment period and have facilitated hundreds of “form letter” comments, the responses from scientists and regulators have been overwhelmingly in favor of the FDA’s plan to dramatically reduce the nicotine content of cigarettes. As the only company in the world growing multiple varieties of Very Low Nicotine flue-cured and burley tobacco varieties, 22nd Century makes possible the FDA’s vital new plan.

chuckangel;"So, I am a ""former"" Sykes student. I dislike how Tim operates certain portions of his business and will never give him another penny of my money. Having said that:

I bought How To Make Millions. $300. Learned a lot, even though I don't think I have mastered that material. Last August I started with $500, I cashed out in December for $3500, so I did okay. I got out of pennystocks for my own reasons. But How To Make Millions made me realize there's something to watching patterns and making educated guesses about where the market was headed. 


Pennystocking Silver - the chatroom is horrible. It's.. cultlike. The Tim worship is unreal. When people are saying things like ""Yes, master!"" to his suggestions, etc, I start to get creeped out.The video library, however... He posts a lot of this stuff on youtube for free, so be aware that with patterns, everything echoes. Once you learn to recognize certain patterns (pumps, and the following dump), it's all more of the same after that. Just be aware. What I'm getting at is that the video lessons are nice to have, but he's got a vast library already available and that once you realize that the patterns are repeating, they happen over and over and over and over and over again... so now you're just paying to watch basically a Twitch replay of a trade.


I don't think PS is particularly worth your time, especially while just beginning. I would recommend HTMM and follow his profit.ly/twitter trades and try to understand what and why he did what he did.* Go through his youtube videos, skip the marketing and focus on the material. It was a fun little hole to fall down, but I'm glad I'm out now.

*There's always a reason. Volume spike, Price Increase, Catalyst, past resistance and support levels. Keep in mind that when you're starting, you'll probably be looking at day/morning movement. That's fine, that's most of what I did, but a lot of Tim's system is shorting a multi-day play. I.e., big movement over a period of a few days (usually a pump of some sort), then picking a good spot to short, especially if shares are available, and knowing when to cut losses. He's more conservative than other traders, but sometimes, 10% in hand is better than -25% in a sudden crash... My biggest losses were due to not following the plan, and trust me, if you fall under the PDT, you will not follow your plan for fear of wasting a day trade.";1531273221;e2608s8;t3_8xugo4;2

DesignPrime;"&gt;In their first report since the transaction in January, the shell released a filing that mentioned Delfin over 40+ times. Essentially, the filing was representative of Delfin as if they had already taken over the shell company with intent to use. But this was still speculation. Another factor that was noted by a team of individuals on a separate board was that in that same filing, there were clauses that mentioned NASDAQ listing requirements and compliance thereof. These were low in frequency and really amounted to not much more than an increase in speculation of what was to become of the shell.

&gt; This speculation was chaotic as one side said even if the company were to use the shell, they would only use it to raise money then drop it at an instant. Or that they would r/s the stock into oblivion and beyond with something akin to a 100:1 r/s leaving current shareholders holding the bag before the big bang.

Few questions if you don't mind,

Where can I find this report by back in January? I would be interested to read through this myself.

How do reverse mergers work? 

I read the gist of it googling for about half an hour where the private company is essentially driving to save money by using a shell company and bypassing the IPO altogether. What I am wondering is how the shares of the shell company will be valued if a reverse merger occurs. Is it instant spike in value? I feel there is something here; something to the effect of reverse splits where you don't actually get the inflated return. It seems too good to be true where the return can spike 30x overnight.

I'll probably throw just a few hundred bucks in this for fun/speculation but part of me wants to spend more time researching. If there are any other resources I can dig into this, do let me know. This will be fun to speculate and follow along.";1532664482;e341aiq;t3_8xveog;1
DesignPrime;Good point about just investing in the team. How many shares are you in?;1532664646;e341fff;t3_8xveog;2
potatoclump;"Ok so the filings are all in the SEC.gov website just search Edgar search tools for theglobe.com and you can find all filings for TGLO. The first report I mentioned that has Delfin in it over 40 times is the 10K they released in March I believe.

There is a lot of DD about who owns what percentage of shares in the shell currently. Delfin holds 70.9%, Enbridge for sure holds 5% and Talisman Global Investments holds two large stakes in an undisclosed investment as they are split between two hedge funds and are under $100mil each so they have no requirement of disclosure but as far as anyone knows Talisman is only currently involved with Delfin.

The float of TGLO is speculated to be immensely low as the price fluctuations against small volume seem to indicate most of the shares are locked up by someone. There's no telling exactly how many shares the big players in this RM own for sure right now but it's believed that insiders and related parties own up to 85% conservatively.

If you talk about value there are several factors at play. First is the base value of Delfin as a private company. Delfin had filed a tax form of which $400 per million dollars of value is required in taxes for the state of Delaware which the filing was released. If you calculate backwards the taxes paid you can arrive at a $336mil valuation for the base private company. Additionally, Enbridge signed over the UTOS pipeline segment in the gulf to Delfin in exchange for 5% equity in the project. The value of the pipeline was $400million at the time. So obviously for Enbridge to get back their investment they'd need a 20x increase in the valuation of Delfin over $400mil which would bring the total valuation up to $8bil for Enbridge to break even on a 5% equity stake. It's also worth noting that the raw asset value of the pipeline in operation is worth $1.65bil alone.

There's a lot more I can get into but based on that factor alone you can calculate a 123x return over the current market cap which means even if there is a 100:1 r/s you would still break even or make a small profit.

Now assuming a complete merger of all assets and the whole Delfin project, there are additional value factors that can come into play. For example, they received a $1.5bil loan from South Korea to fund the project. They also signed a contract with China to export 3mil mtpa of LNG over 15 years which comes out to roughly $12bil in total revenue and $800mil per year. So if you take into account fair valuation based on a multiplier of revenue and cash of around 10x you can get a conservative market cap of about $62bil. This includes the pipeline, cash investments, loans, and revenue of the China contract. Which would be 997x return over the current TGLO market cap. So unless you think a 1000:1 r/s is realistic you'll likely make some money should the RM actually happen.


I'm writing this very quickly and maybe could be more thorough so let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns because I'm also still learning and studying this whole ordeal.

Edit: it's also worth saying that this isn't a typical RM situation as the value discrepancy between the shell and the private company is massive. There have been cases where a RM has netted 10,000%+ gains and you can find a list of historical RMs that had huge increases in share price. I'm almost certain a r/s would occur at some point but when you're considering the ratio you really are trying to figure out how the company consolidates publicly held shares vs insider and related parties. Typically a company wants control over at least 85% of the outstanding shares when going through a RM and they'll r/s if they can't get to that number without doing so. Since Delfin and affiliates may already have more than 85% it's less likely there would be a significant r/s.

Another question which I don't have any answers to is share structure. I'm not sure what's allowed by regulatory agencies in regards to consolidation and changing share type to AS or preferred shares and how that would affect ownership or possibilities of dilution.


I think it's smart to put a conservative amount of cash into the shell because of course there's still a risk you could lose it all but this certainly seems like a rare opportunity. Which means it's probably too good to be true but whatev.";1532710238;e350eg1;t3_8xveog;2
DesignPrime;I would be interested to know the reverse split for a case like TELL and the price before the split and see what kind of return was made on that. It seems to me even if a reverse merger goes through you are playing the numbers with what kind of ratio split they do which I don't like. If it was more of a probability chance at x% return it would be more intriguing than having the reverse split lower the overall return.;1532711681;e352717;t3_8xveog;1
potatoclump;Not sure what you mean, ratio and percentages are related in this case. If you have a 10:1 consolidation and they reissue those same shares out after the r/s your investment will be 10% of what it was which means you'd need 1000% to break even.;1532713378;e354ap7;t3_8xveog;1
vmar27;"You sold me on 700 shares, lol. Meh..

Beats buying scratch tickets 😂😂";1532724729;e35h9mq;t3_8xveog;1
DesignPrime;So my return is directly correlated what ratio they decide in the case that the reverse merger goes through;1532725316;e35hwkx;t3_8xveog;1
potatoclump;It's a lot more complicated than that. You have to understand what kind of ownership a company going through a RM is looking for and what kind of share structure is common amongst currently publicly traded companies, the shares owned by retail vs private insiders or investors and consider a range of ratios that would be reasonable for a r/s then compare that against the potential increase in market cap if the private company merged into the public company which in this case is TGLO which trades with a market cap between 45-65mil. Delfin is worth 336 excluding the UTOS pipeline so that alone gives you a break even if the r/s is 5:1. But there's honestly no real way to figure out what kind of r/s if any will happen so I'm not going to lie and tell you you'd make xxx% return. Also with this type of r/s the point would be to dilute current ownership of retail so I'm factoring in the assumption that the shares which were just consolidated would be offered back into the market causing your investment to be diluted.;1532726744;e35jevj;t3_8xveog;1
potatoclump;I will say that typically a company's target ownership for a RM is 85% which is what it looks like may be the case for Delfin already. They certainly already have 80% in the hands of the company, directors and CEO. Because of this I think the r/s will be minimal if there is one at all and with the estimated value of current investments by Enbridge and Talisman, the UTOS pipeline and their permit to export to non-FTA countries, partnership with Bechtel, loan from South Korea, contracts with Poland and china, there is great potential for the market cap to hit tens of billions if not more. 46,200% over current SP. or it could be a huge flop. Up to you to decide;1532727417;e35k48w;t3_8xveog;1
DesignPrime;This is where I think digging into the TELL stock will be beneficial to get an approximation before/after.;1532732814;e35pk6g;t3_8xveog;1
potatoclump;"I don't think they're comparable at all. Delfin has an edge on Tellurian in more ways than one. For example, TELL doesn't have a permit to export LNG yet despite them thinking they're going ahead with the production of ships and terminals. The DoE just came out and said delays are to be expected in the processing of permit requests which could take anywhere from 1-2 years. The permit Delfin has is the only permit that has been granted for an LNG exporter to do business with countries outside of a free trade agreement with the United States, putting their business far ahead of competitors. This permit is good for 15 years or more as long as they're using it. The permit can be considered priceless but the real value it will bring will become more clear as they sign contracts around the globe.

TELL also doesn't have any pipeline assets available or ready to be used in order to transport LNG to a terminal for export and they're in the early stages of engineering studies to build one. The UTOS pipeline Delfin will be using has been maintained by Enbridge and will need a few valve modifications to reverse the flow of LNG out into the gulf where the LNG terminals will be sitting. The raw asset value of the UTOS pipeline that Enbridge dumped into Delfin alone is worth 75% of the current market cap of TELL.

The company TELL RM into also had a completely different share structure which wouldn't have allowed for the liquidity they needed in order to raise funds for their project. The shareholders were diluted because TELL needed more shares in the market in order for investors to show any interest. TGLO has somewhere around 450 million outstanding shares of which 85% are likely owned by Delfin and any equity to insiders. This leaves around the same amount of shares that TELL dumped into the market with their RM dilution.

The before/after on TELL was that old shareholders investments were worth 3% of what they were before the RM. The dilution amounted to a 33:1 split if you want to look at it that way even though it wasn't technically a r/s.

They both are RM but that's where the similarities end so you can't really gauge a direct comparison of the two and come out with any meaningful insight into how the situation with Delfin will work out.";1532750775;e3656im;t3_8xveog;1

No debt!!! 210 M shares outstanding with no dilution, only a few more warrants are outstanding, with most expired by next June.

silverwhere81;Naproxen is the most common prescribed NSAID. Yes, your also correct it's a Hydrogen Sulfide release instead of oxygen which apparently is non-inflammatory for GI.

Well, for starters, ATBPF is an OTC stock w/ low volume.

ATBPF is also trending sideways, so there isn't much action or volatility from this stock. ";1531362538;e28dljx;t3_8y3c9p;3

JakeFromIowa;"I started trading about 6 months ago, mainly penny stocks.

Once you get down all the terms and how to understand stocks, it really just comes down to your DD and charts.

Do as much research about a company as possible. Look at their products, market, and financials (make sure they are making money).

Research the charts and look at trends, make sure the stock is trending in the right direction and that people are buying and selling on a regular basis.

You can then also head over to investorshub to see what people are talking about on the company.

I also use traders news source (more for long term hold options), they always have good plays. 

I am up about 60&amp;#37; from my initial investments and i use Fidelity (4.95 per trade, Active Trader Pro is free).

Gcu12;According to their blog they'll launch this summer. It's no launched yet;1531494885;e2blcx7;t3_8yjndi;2
Gcu12;You should do some DD and act soon. Myflix will launch this summer (they have mentioned a date 27th July, not sure if this is still the launch date) Let me know if you need clarification on anything. ;1531494972;e2blgmk;t3_8yjndi;3
Bull_Market_Bully;So its not exactly on the verge of a breakout;1531495086;e2blljj;t3_8yjndi;2
Gcu12;"Yes, I'm not predicting any PPS. But I have done some estimates from facts (See this picture link [https://ibb.co/c0AAMo](https://ibb.co/c0AAMo) )

As you can see from the estimate it shows that with 100.000 Myflix users HHSE will have an instrinsic value of 0.061 with a conservative PE of 12. Remember Netflix have +125 millions user, and Myflix will be the streaming service with the most content really fast, do you think they can get 1&amp;#37; of the users Netflix have? That would make it 1 million users, do the math yourself and you will see why this is a no brainer!

Any questions fell free to ask";1531498494;e2bptsd;t3_8yjndi;3

ShakeJeridan;Where does the claim “the streaming service with the most content really fast” come from, and is using the 1% of Netflix subscribers figure based on anything or was it an arbitrarily low number?;1531742768;e2h6ac2;t3_8yjndi;1
Gcu12;"It comes straight from the CEO:

*We are working on a variety of pre-launch activities for Myflix, including website development, mastering and uploading of titles, long-lead P.R. campaigns, launch ads and videos and strategic positioning and goals. However, for competitive reasons, we cannot publicly disclose more than just these broad strokes at this time. The total inventory of available content from our current suppliers is over 10,000 programs (feature films and or television episodics). About 800 of the initial 2,500 titles set for* *our July 27 launch date* *are already properly formatted / mastered for streaming access. The others will require some degree of mastering attention, most commonly the addition of closed-captions or reformatting into streaming compatible media.* ***(Taken from their blog*** [\*\*\*http://hannoverhousemovies.blogspot.com/\*\*\*](http://hannoverhousemovies.blogspot.com/)\*\*\*)\*\*\*

Netflix has somewhere between 4-5000 movies for comparison. 30+ suppliers are already signed up for Myflix

Yes, 1&amp;#37; was arbitrary. However I see 1 million users achievable pretty fast? You can use whatever number you prefer but anything above (If I recall it correctly) 15.000 users will make Myflix profitable. So IMO Myflix will make HHSE a lot of money.

Feel free to ask for better clarification

I got scared as it played around down there for a bit, so once it got past 1.75 again I sold, at 1.76. Ugg. It went down from there again, but then freaking shot up to $2.59 before the end of the day. Wouldn't have been a huge gain, but I was just looking for a quick pop because I knew the news was the catalyst, and also it was alerted by Dekmar Trades on his morning watchlist on Twitter. Kicking myself now, but at least i made a dollar. Hahah.

YUNG_DRIFTY;Big question for you guys-- I have only 1 share on nflx.. currently down 55 dollars. I am considering pulling out at open and splitting the return with BAC and HUYA. Think I should go for it? I hate the idea of back holding like a third of my assets for like weeks..  For one thing I would be diversifying better- I should never had bought a stock that would take so much of my asset percentage. And I think those two could easily make up my 55 loss if not more.;1531804712;e2iygoa;t3_8zd8a0;-2
SofaKingNatty;For that amount, just meh and leverage and margin that shit, keep the NFLX share.;1531836257;e2ji8x4;t3_8zd8a0;1
SofaKingNatty;Still trying to scoop up enough IBAT on the CNSX to get my average share price down below 0.30 for their next run. ;1531836325;e2jibhc;t3_8zd8a0;1

SofaKingNatty;"From a DD perspective fundamentals are pretty shit, but if you look into their operations they're decently healthy as a young company. 

But honestly, it's almost exclusively because I've traded successfully to the tune of 75-120% gains on their promo runs, and I know I can rely on the volume. When it runs, it's consistently one of the most traded stocks on the CNSX for a few days, so there's never a volume problem when you want to exit.

YUNG_DRIFTY;It was taken out of my hands. My ustocktrade hard stop triggered at the bell. I was under the impression that unless it touched the sell point again it wouldn't trigger but it did. Made some money today, still about 20 bucks in the hole from nflx. Learned a few valuable lessons here, I'll continue to adapt my trading outlooks. Gotta say I knew nflx would come back eventually but figured it would be at least next week. This push is pretty impressive.;1531870853;e2kmmax;t3_8zd8a0;1

PerfectRectangle;"The chief scientific officer John Wallace owns the company antibe holdings which owns all the patents, set up that way to protect against hostile takeovers. Antibe holdings has somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 million shares. Wallace himself has around 500k plus 7M options, CEO Dan legault has around 700k shares IIRC and roughly 7M options as well. 

Wallace has spent the better part of 30 years working towards this drug and it essentially is the only thing he will leave as his legacy. He is the #1 cited and published inflammation expert in the world and does it not for the money but for the love of science and mankind. He is exactly the reason I went all in on ATE and have roughly 250k shares. 


There are assorted other insiders with between 1-5M shares and similar amount of options/warrants. Management stands to get wealthy off of a success. ";1532214663;e2szc4j;t3_90t4dw;8
DesignPrime;"What do you think is the reason for the reason selloff back to the $0.30?

Was it because of the additional shares issuances at $0.385? I am thinking the near term catalyst for the stock is the phase 2 dose ranging study that should be out within the next 2-3 months, so I am abit suprised at this selloff with a catalyst coming up so quickly.

Sorry if I come off as a little uninformed (correct me if I am wrong) but as far as potential partnerships for small biotech companies, don't they usually happen after phase 3? But it seems like they are saying in alot of their presentations/financials that they are looking at potential partnerships already. I did some research myself and found that after  phase 3, the companies then file the NDA with the FDA. Phase 3 can take anywhere from 1-4 years.";1532215619;e2t06ei;t3_90t4dw;2
PerfectRectangle;"They issued very little shares, so no I don't think so.

Looks like in the last week there were 800k warrants redeemed. ATE has been floating around the long term support of 375ish for a while now. I'm guessing that since there was a huge support wall at 36 and 365 and 37, someone with hundreds of K warrants dumped on the walls to redeem and get cash for other pursuits or to reno their house or to do a bunch of coke or whatever... whatever someone needs money for who knows. There were 2 houses that took out the support this week and just those 2 sellers. As soon as it hit 355 it seemed like a bunch of stops were getting hit as I watched L2 trades come and go. Then probably a bunch of people saw it dropping and panicked and sold, so on and so forth. The volume going down was very low... about 400k shares only took us from 35 to 31 then penny flippers churned it up and down a few cents. Unfortunate that with summer the volume and bids were so thin because it dropped so quick. If I had dumped my holdings I could have taken it down to 24c at one time as well... just the results of low volume kinda fuckin up the ticker.

That being said, there's about 100k on the ask from current point back to the 38 support. It seems like no one wants to be selling down here, it's just churning a bit as people flip for a few hundred bucks for pennies. 


As for the trial, small biotechs never do phase 3 alone, they always sell after phase 2 trials. Phase 3 costs a good 40M and very little if any small companies have that. Mgmt has said numerous times as soon as phase 2 is done they will be either selling rights to atb346 or looking to sell their whole company, based on the offer. So there is a large payday coming for sure in the immediacy following the next trial results.";1532215961;e2t0h67;t3_90t4dw;10
DesignPrime;Thanks for all the insight, much appreciated. It seems to be me that if we ever get back to the 0.38/0.40 level, it will be a really tough wall to break.

I am playing this one for the long haul, I personally don't know as much or own as much as PerfectRectangle or some of the redditors that have been talking about this stock for a while now. I just wanted to get some more experienced minds on my concerns that I had with the company. 

With that in mind, my opinion is that if they are successful in the upcoming trial or selling the rights, there should be substantial increase from the current share price. This is a pretty binary play that hinges on execution of the trial as well as getting partnerships for their drug. If they are able to do that, I don't think I would sell. Selling the rights usually involves a royalty of some sort, so its not as if they sold it and have nothing in their belt.

PerfectRectangle;"If they sell the rights theyll get a royalty deal. If the drug makes it to market and makes say 1B a year for its patent life (a reasonable guess) with a standard 10-12% royalty that's 100-120M/year cash in antibe pocket.

At a PE of only 10 that's 1.2B market cap which is over $4/share at fully diluted 260M. PE of 20 gives us over $8/share. Easy to play around with the numbers and see how things could evolve over 10 years of patent life with 4 compounds they have going currently. ";1532239680;e2tiw4w;t3_90t4dw;5

CopperNickus;No point in bailing now.    There's still the outside chance that this could turn into a mother of a short squeeze.  If they restructure their program into something acceptable to users and profitable and successfully monetize the user base they've been accumulating, all of the complaints will go away.   But they need to stay alive for that to happen.  If they reverse split, it's going to probably slide right back down to 10 cents again if they can't get institutional buy in right away.  The stock has to have a minimum stock price for some institutions to even touch it, so that may be what they are going for.  But the reverse split is going to screw up everyone's chances for a good percentage multiple on any recovery.  Shareholders might be better off if it dropped to the OTCBB.

That being said, I do not think investors will back out anytime soon as they see the long term on the idea that MP is. Skeptics predicted the company to fall by the end of 2017, then again in May then June and now its July 2018 with no end in sight especially from investors. 

There is a very large sense of confusion as to how they will be profitable and movie tickets are not it. It will be the concessions, the experiences outside the theatre (restaurants) and other sponsorships and collaboration.

Do I think there is a chance everyone backs out and calls it a fluke, yes.

The senhance machine has true haptic feedback and reusable instruments which can save hospitals tons of money in the long run. Currently the davinci requires new instruments to be used for each surgery.

Youre looking at an average of 1.5 mil robot cost, 100k yearly fee, and 500-1600 per procedure for davinci.

IIRC Senhance costs 1-1.5 million up front, don't know yearly fees, but with reusable instruments per procedure costs will be considerably less than davinci.

The only question is... how big of a market is left since so many hospitals have a davinci already. Florida has been using the Senhance and like it a lot.

queenslandbananas;Essentially all penny stocks suck and their overall trajectory is downwards - typically massively downwards - even the ones that everyone thinks are different (in fact, especially those ones.)

jaanders;"What stock is it? You're down to $20k or you're balance is now $130k?

If no one will buy them, you can try contacting investor relations. I've done this before, they're generally really helpful / responsive and might be able to provide a solution. I've never done this for an illiquid position though. 

Or buy enough puts in it so that if it does drop you have a contract that gives you the right to sell your shares. 

Or sell calls on the stock so that if it does go up someone can exercise your calls, you keep the premium paid for the option, and you're out with a decent gain.

I would also consider calling a bank, like TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, E Trade, Goldman Sachs. Etc. They love making deals. I had some puts once that raised so much in value I was worried no one would buy them so I would have to exercise them but I didn't have $2.3M to buy the shares, i contacted a bank to have them lend you the money and so I could exercise them in the event that they were sellable. Ended up being sellable thankfully because FB has so much volume. 

But there are ways, just gotta know that these banks love making deals. 

You could also talk to your broker about a peer to peer transaction, you find someone who wants to buy the stock from you and they set up the transaction.

If you're only down $20k out of $150k then I would hold (depending on the stock). That's just how it goes, the long hold principle of equity is that stocks are more likely than not to recover from a loss over time.

slams;"""Moving forward, subject to the approval of the court and with support from its monitor or receiver appointed by the court, the company intends to:

-- solicit liquidators to bid on the acquisition and disposal of the

company's assets, including the Sarnia plant;

-- continue to actively engage with Qualified Bidders and other interested

parties to determine if, and under what terms, a transaction that would

result in the continuation of the company's operations is still possible.

We estimate this process will be conducted over an approximate two-week period with a target conclusion date of August 14. The company will engage with Maynbridge Capital, its interim lender, and all other secured lenders to determine the best going-forward strategy.

""We are clearly disappointed that the Qualified Bidders did not place an acceptable offer for Bioamber,"" stated Richard Eno, CEO. ""We will continue to be actively engaged with potential investors to seek an acceptable transaction and avoid the liquidation of the company's assets. Most importantly, I'd like to thank our dedicated and highly capable employees for their outstanding service to the company.""

Potential investors can contact Richard Eno in order to express interest in acquiring the assets or investing in the business.

Note that there can be no guarantee that the company will be successful in securing further financing or achieving its restructuring objectives. Failure by the company to achieve its financing and restructuring goals will likely result in the company and its subsidiaries being liquidated. Liquidation will almost certainly result in no residual value for non-secured creditors and equity investors.""";1532966572;e3ao8x2;t3_935192;3

The reason why pennystocks are so volatile is because they’re **highly manipulated**.

This is a huge de-risk going into an *efficacy* study of all things. Metabolism of ATB-346 was one of the biggest risks/missing pieces yet, if they can really nail the metabolites in humans and also show why/how the drug is more potent than naproxen then this thing will be all bit giftwrapped for big pharma after the final phase 2 readout next year.

tacopwnsyou;I'm huge long on this, 150k shares, but you may have better buying opportunities still.  Hard to say as there will be multiple more press releases on the horizon, including the journal they plan to publish all data so far on 346 in.  That could get more eyes on this and drive price up.  The only reason I see potential for this to come down still in the short term is that the data readout from final phase 2b trial is now pushed one more quarter.  Technically it could come on day 1 of q2 2019 and that isn't a big difference, but the company did push expectations from q4 2018 to q1 2019 and now to q2 2019.  Seems a lot of shares are in the hands of people who either penny flip or think they're going to get rich overnight, they eventually get bored, and price drifts downward.  Prices also have been drifting downward on suspected warrant dumpers who are in the money as large 100k+ blocks have been market sold with enough regularity and the outstanding share count later goes up.  Obviously I don't have a crystal ball, this long winded reply is just to say if you want in, you may not have even seen the best price yet.;1533052654;e3cun80;t3_93dm30;6

DesignPrime;"Why do I feel like this sub is always a perma bull for this stock? Isn't it negative news that they push the 2B results first from Q4 2018 to Q1 2019 and now to Q2 2019? It just a delay in their timeline. The market seems to be agreeing with this sentiment. Also, as another poster pointed out, this is likely to dip lower as more people process the news of the delay. 

Curious people thoughts on this are, especially the people who are holding a ton of shares.";1533058987;e3d2fpk;t3_93dm30;1
pwd9398;"My thoughts are above... the delay is a delay, at least as far as phase 2 is concerned. But the metabolic data they've hinted at so far- plus the data theyll get from the additional human metabolic protocol- represent a significant de-risk in the long term (phase 3 and FDA meetings).

We have safety in the bag. Just need further proof of efficacy. And thats why a statement like this makes me erect:

&gt;""The recently obtained data on several metabolites of ATB-346 provide significant insights to understanding the increased potency and duration-of-activity of the drug.""
";1533059226;e3d2qb4;t3_93dm30;2
tacopwnsyou;"That is a solid lesson but tbh the day to day fluctuations on this stock don't matter unless you're short term trying to flip pennies.  We all wish we had sold post phase 2b results last time and bought back in.  Hindsight 20/20.  But why did most of us buy this stock?  For the expected success of ATB-346.

This is a more or less binary stock.  The drug either is successful or is not.  If not, the entire pipeline becomes questionable.  Citagenix doesn't have a lot of value but would keep stock from actually going to 0.  If successful, big pharma is needed to run phase 3 because of the large cost associated and CEO was explicit at shareholder meeting about exit strategy being partner or buyout.  The company values the pipeline in the billions per their website.  The last major NSAID to come to market was heavily advertised and sold 1.5B in its first year of sales.  With expected patent life of 9 years or so, Antibe isn't going to sell out for under 1B.  Perhaps they choose to partner instead and get 10% royalty on 1B sales to be conservative.  That's 100M a year in profit as big pharma is running the show and we are just collecting royalty cash.  A 10 p/e then values us at 1B.  Fully diluted share count around 260M was always to be assumed as we are only invested for the hopes of success of the drug, thus all options and warrants exercised, hence their value of being granted to execs who brought us success and financiers for putting up private equity.  This yields an almost $4 share price.  Day to day ups and downs are just people trading paper for the myriad reasons they do.  Long term success of this drug doesn't depend on paper traders and Antibe's negotiations with big pharma will rest on science, not share price.";1533064804;e3d9hcp;t3_93dm30;5
PerfectRectangle;"I think because the underlying company, scientific team, and end game potential are massive. Every piece of data that comes out furthers this however timelines and OS share count have quite honestly fucked up the play quite badly. 

I think the next 6 months will lull but then people will slowly come back until we see pre trial hype climb like we had last year until the inevitable results day. ";1533077987;e3dosoa;t3_93dm30;4

tacopwnsyou;I don't doubt many will, but when I try to time things, I lose.  I'd be too afraid of a pharma with nsaid on market already realizing this drug could significantly hurt their bottom line and swooping in to steal this up before we all think Antibe is done with it.  I don't think there is a good chance of that happening, but the very possibility is enough for me to not want to get caught with my pants down.;1533153280;e3fkuhj;t3_93dm30;2
silverwhere81;"I think we are seeing a bit of that today.  Though anything in the .20's for the potential of this stock is a great deal.  Depending on the board you are watching, a lot of people hopped in during the 0.40's and they will probably happily buy shares in the .20's to average down there share cost.  As for me, I've been in since before the Phase 2b results dropped and I see the potential of this stock.  The company is fully funded to finish this study for part 1 and 2 of phase 2b.  We already know from the Phase 2A trial that the WOMAC scores were unreal; if the Phase 2b Part 2 WOMAC scores are outstanding, as expected, but during a 200 patient double blind study, were well into the money.  Only remaining part is the FDA approval post Phase 2b which is what ATE considers the conclusion of Phase 2.  They are taking their time to align the results to ensure FDA does not deny, hence the updated Phase 2b Part 1 Metobolic study.  In short, as we get closer each day to April 2019, I do not think you'll see shares in the 20's for long, as I will happily buy if even to hold and sell before Phase 2b Part II results are published.

silverwhere81;Other than yesterday and today, the volume has been tight.  Not sure what your holding, but if anyone was to unload 50,000 shares, its hard to see how you could even find the volume at the price.  I bought another 20,000 a little over a week ago at 30.5, but couldn't fill the initial 30,000 request at that limit.  So sell high and buy low can work, but depending on your amounts, you could get priced out and lose.  Also, while I hardly have a prediction on how low or high this stock will go.  Given the company is fully funded to find out our potential lotto ticket with time being the only variable.  If the stock does dip, a lot of us are coming into buy shares.  I tried to fill at 0.275 today and there wasn't much on Level 2 TSX.  In short, any dips will be bought up quickly, and any rises will be sold quickly given out timeline.

They cannot afford P3 alone so they are at the very least getting a partnership with a larger pharma company.

The fact that they missed their expectations with this means that they probably has a bidding war going on and 2 or more companies are fighting over this partnership. 

They have one other major drug to report P2 on. 

They said that they are launching another drug into trials but have not made the official announcement. This lack of PR suggests that they are waiting to just announce a lot of news all at once.

Now, the price you are selling will also play. Sell for under market and it'll sell much quicker than above market price.

WeKnowAlot;"You shouldn’t invest into penny stocks to grasp an understanding of how it all works. Stocks are traded in various ways and the common understanding is buy when you, yes you, believe the stock is considered undervalued, and sold when you believe overvalued. There is money to be made through companies failures, this is called “shorting” in general, and money to be made on the upside, this is “going long”.

krazytekn0;It depends on your goals and your financial situation. I keep seeing people who treat penny stocks as some sort of strategy to do with large amounts of their disposable income. You should treat penny stocks as what it is. Gambling. Budget for it as an entertainment expense. When you have enough money not to care about $250.00, put $250 into penny stocks.;1533570970;e3pgpj0;t3_952b2x;4

r-just-wrong;Institutions will probably continue to hold this, I think the drop was an overreaction and will correct before the eom but if your worried I recommend selling your shares and using the capital to sell some 5 puts for August or September for the amout of shares you had previously.  You could get the shares assigned at 4.50 or if it goes up you made 10% in 2 weeks, best case scenario for you is if it goes to $5.01 at exp and you can then buy in as if it was $4.51, or you can sell next months 5.50 for around 15% and have your buy in around 4.70.  I'm sitting on the $5 October I sold for $.90 for 1k shares worth so if it stays flat or it goes down my buy in is $4.10 when I would have bought in today at 4.75, so worst case scenario I saved 17% of the possible loss. Best case it sits between 5 and 6 and I buy in with the proceeds in October.

Vivid82;So they just merged with unifire that has access to 900 million dollars worth of government contracts. They are closing and renegotiating a 400 million dollar deal with a foreign military. They have the amber project that is supposed to dwarf both of these deals. They have a management team filled with heavy weights that boast guys like JOe Reid and police commissioner Bill Bratton. Their products are a head of their time. And they are halted at the moment waiting to close the merger with unifire. Trading at .215 pre halt is a steal right now.

Overall, I think we've seen a dip because with Pennies you have a lot of people looking to profit quickly. For that kind of trader, money locked up for an extra 3 months means money they can't be using to flip penny stocks. With that kind of strategy, it's looked at as a loss if the stock is just moving sideways.

MiracleDreaming;Interesting find. I have some questions for you, as I’m not well versed with the wheat market. You say this goodwheat is being catered to the niche market of gluten free people, what other wheat is currently doing this? Are there specifics regarding goodwheat and it’s actually differences from other wheats? Another pretty large factor that shouldn’t be over looked is taste. I’m assuming all these will be answered after the testing that you talk about. When exactly is that supposed to occur / will there be an article or write up published somewhere for it? Look forward to monitoring this stock ;1534003445;e40h8wh;t3_96goac;3
JoelandNoel;What makes you think they will dilute again? And when do you think that will happen? ;1534003677;e40hh7g;t3_96goac;2
aurochfam;"&gt;Are there specifics regarding goodwheat and it’s actually differences from other wheats?

They used a labor intensive method to target their ""good wheat"" traits. These initialized the breeding program and have been improved to the elite cultivar status of high yield, disease resistance, and quality baking and taste. This is why they will have an edge over competitors. It takes a long time to build in novel traits like these. Apparently they had foresight about the 'celical disease epidemic' and selected these traits years before it became a hot button issue.

Arcadia’s RG product is a non-GM, patent-pending, identity preserved specialty wheat in which allergenic glutens have been reduced by 75 percent and overall gluten content has been reduced by 60 percent. At the same time, the levels of glutens important for bread-making are not changed. 

They have a Resistant Starch line as well which acts as high fiber bread that is also good for the microbiome ( they claim) which if true is also a big shtick, more realistic than the low-gluten but that will bring in the PR.

The products that use their wheat will have a ""GOOD WHEAT"" stamp on it similar to the Non-GMO butterfly you've seen adding a premium to products using it

&gt;what other wheat is currently doing this?

Technically no, however there have been groups who made use of a novel hybridization betwen durum wheat (standard bread wheat) and wild barley to acheive something similar. This is a shortcut and has the consequences you mention of affecting characteristics of the baking and consumer tastes. Others are surely doing it, but it is unclear where in the 10-year breeding pipeline or which genetic targets they have focused on. The advantage comes from the NON-GM angle where they've been breeding exclusively with durum wheat for the past 10 years.

\&gt;  Another pretty large factor that shouldn’t be over looked is taste. I’m assuming all these will be answered after the testing that you talk about.

Yes.

\&gt;When exactly is that supposed to occur / will there be an article or write up published somewhere for it?

From the latest confernce call: This is how wheat breeders have operated for decades. This is the final step to show that their long hard-work is valuable and they will be doing it now. I believe the low-gluten is a year behind. Since it is commercially available, that means Millers have been using it and will likely publicly announce a partnership with them, I believe in this next quarter. Perhaps exclusive rights to the good wheat brand, from the biggest miller in the U.S.

* Advancing GoodWheat Commercialization Plan. Arcadia’s focus in Q3 will be on building and expanding partnerships throughout the wheat supply chain with growers, seed companies, millers and food companies. The first product in the GoodWheat portfolio, Resistant Starch wheat, is anticipated to be commercially available in 2019, so these partnerships will be key to launching innovative wheat ingredients and forming the foundation of a long-term, sustainable business.
*   Over the next 12 to 36 months, as the company transitions to its new focus on health and nutrition quality products, Arcadia expects revenue from government grants, research contracts and license revenues to be replaced by product and trait revenues. ";1534008712;e40mgzq;t3_96goac;2
aurochfam;"&gt;What makes you think they will dilute again? And when do you think that will happen?

This is just a guess based on what I witnessed from TNDM before they blew up. They did several dilutions in a short time frame, perhaps to cover liability insurance or something with the partnerships they've signed, I am not extremely familiar with business practices at this point of a company's life, but it wouldn't surprise me to see one more, but not two+";1534008806;e40mkh5;t3_96goac;1

Derp2638;Well first you need to be 18 for a trading account. Also, realize penny stocks you can be up ____% and down ____% with in a day or two. Stocks is not for the faint of heart. In addition playing penny stock millionaire is something you should stay away from. Ex :this company is going to go from .01 to 1.00. Stay away from pharmaceutical stocks. Do your own research and dd + look at market sentiment (yahoo stock boards and stock twits.) often times a lot of bs but valuable info here as well as some who know what they are doing. Also, look towards the future of a stock that’s realistic ,  if you’re down 20% but you did your research and know they will beat earnings or they will come out with a Pr release that’s good don’t be afraid to hold. You only lose money when you sell. You only make money when you sell. My first trade I was down 33% (LITERALLY the day I bought it) knew the company had somethings in the near future upcoming and made 300%.  Good luck. I know that was a lot but it’s what I could think of for right now feel free to ask questions. ;1534304111;e47q3zg;t3_97ex2f;1

What does have me concerned, though, is that no one will deal with this. It doesn't help that the volume is super low. It's been listed for over a year now, and the price hit triple from what it originally listed at, but it is currently about double, so I technically have double the equity.

But I can't effectively sell my shares because the market volume is no where near the amount of shares I have. I was planning on selling a fraction, and even that fraction was more than the past 30-day volume.

Otherwise, apart from brokers, you can always try to find like-minded individuals in rooms like these so as to conduct a private transaction.

It's not as far fetched since, after all, there are people who just like owning a nominal number of shares just to receive the annual reports and receive the annual meeting invitations.

David Choe (born April 21, 1976) is an American street artist. His figure paintings, which explore themes of desire, degradation, and exaltation, are characterized by a raw, frenetic tone that he has termed ""dirty style."" In the graffiti world, he is identified with the bucktoothed whale he has been spray-painting on the streets since he was in his teens. David also hosted DVDASA, a lifestyle, relationship and entertainment podcast with co-host Asa Akira. He also became widely recognized for his watercolor works which exhibited in his solo show at the Museo Universario del Chopo, Mexico City in 2013.

heliogt2;"You have a paper certificate? 

Does it have a ""legend"" attached (on the back of it perhaps) that describes restrictions on the resale of your stock, perhaps? If it does have that legend, any sale would need to be conducted in accordance with those restrictions to be lawful. There might be restrictions on when you can make the sale (lock up period) and/or the type of investor you can sell it to.

If you end up selling the stock privately in certificate form, you'll need an attorney to draw up a purchase and sale agreement or similar to effect the transfer of ownership.

the_b00ts;You shouldn’t be concerned with a pennystock becoming the next Netflix. They will drop as much, if not more, than they rise on some occasions.

For penny’s, look for the accumulation and get a piece of the pump. ;1534655980;e4g6gvt;t3_98htre;8

BLarga54321;"I am pretty sure he want's to know penny stock companies that aren't shit. 
Use https://www.investing.com/stock-screener. 
Then just adjust the screener to reduce risk. 
- Past 5 years earnings growth: Over 20%
- PE ratio: Under 20, over 2
- Debt to Equity: Under 0.8
Then you'll notice all the penny stocks aren't on the list anymore and good companies are there. Then you buy good companies that you like, that you think can sustain their growth and are cheap in value. 
That's all to it.
