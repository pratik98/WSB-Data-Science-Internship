It rose due to the semi pre orders taking off. From 300ish to 330. 
310ish now. Hard to tell... if guidance doesnt get slashed i think it can rise back to 330.

damileslol;Amazon's valuation is ridiculous, it's trading with a p/e ratio of over 300. Target has far more room to grow realistically with a solid retail chain with growing sales, a solid online division with even better growth and a low p/e ratio of 16. Amazon is over valued and spread too thin, especially after the Whole Foods acquisition. In order to actually compete with Kroger or any other grocers in actual sales they would have to cut Whole Foods nearly in half (if you've ever been to one you'll know that isn't much of an exaggeration). What's more is, Whole Foods doesn't have any higher a profit margin than most other grocers as is. So unless Amazon is content with only filling the niche, high income market of Whole Foods, they will have to take serious losses from that subsidiary. I don't believe this is the case. It seems the primary intention was to use whole foods as the base for their grocery delivery service. So Amazon will either decide to hemorrhage money in order to compete with Kroger or charge outlandish prices that only current whole foods customers will really be willing to pay.;1515824640;dslzhmp;t3_7pybah;4

killer_otter;I don't understand why you bought those stocks. It appears you may have bought the hype and are just gambling. It would be great to get on the ground floor of the next big tech stock, but that's very difficult and I believe more often than not that strategy would end up picking more losers than winners. Try looking for stocks that are somewhat established with a track record of success. Twilo only had the one big client, uber. If you want to be in on telecommunications I like AMT on the dips. Please do your own dd though. Good luck.;1517070162;dtbowbo;t3_7stwhq;1

MKM Partners raises its AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) price target from $13 to $14.50, a 12% upside on Friday’s closing price.

Analyst Ruben Roy maintains a Neutral rating but feels more upbeat on the company’s immediate prospects and the earnings report tomorrow. 

Roy’s optimism comes from “recent positive data points around the PC, server, and cryptocurrency mining markets” with most of the “upside delta” coming from crypto. 

Roy expresses long-term caution: “From a longer-term perspective, we continue to view the crypto market from a conservative stance and while we continue to appreciate AMD’s recent execution, we have yet to see evidence of meaningful share gains with the company’s recently introduced product families.”

Ripkeii;I believe it is a 49.99 fee for no load fee at TD ..I ended paying this fee without researching. So make sure to do your research!;1526181555;dyw5lbp;t3_8iwjgc;3
ravvitskeetballs;Ayyyymmmmdeeeee;1526185983;dyw8u0m;t3_8iwjgc;1
Poldi-1;Fees are definitely a point in your strategy. Some brokers offer a savings plan where they invest a fixed amount each month in an ETF of your choice, not charging any fees as an incentive ;1526212855;dywlbsy;t3_8iwjgc;3
Goose506;"I pay 9.99 a trade with TD. That's 10% a buy down the drain. It's another 9.99 to sell. It would be a horrible thing to do for yourself monthly at a low amount. 

That being said mutual funds don't have a buy/sell fee so that wouldn't be bad but if you enjoy the market, that takes all the fun out of picking specifically what you want. 

If you have good discipline what you can do is throw $100 into your TFSA each month and wait for the 52 week low. Once or twice a year you buy the stock of your choice at it's low, the money would be closer to $700-1200 and would give you more return on your bounce.

Last point, all the banks charge $9.99ish a trade but the other trade platforms are around $5.99-6.99 saving you almost half in costs. ";1526214298;dywm4js;t3_8iwjgc;3
Royal_Squirrel;"49.99 for no load mutual fund, free on no transaction fee funds, and just the % sales load for front or back load funds. 

But there are commission free ETFs that I would like into if I were looking to invest an amount like $100 a month. ";1526217676;dywoafc;t3_8iwjgc;1
Royal_Squirrel;Check on the commission free ETFs list under the “Research and Ideas” tab. There are quite a few of them and if you find something you like commission free is a much more efficient play for continued investments of $100. ;1526217786;dywodba;t3_8iwjgc;2
davidcom;"Buying mutual founds is probably one of the most reasonable ways to make this plan work. Though I totally feel what u said about not having the fun of choosing the stocks myself. 
";1526221964;dywrnmv;t3_8iwjgc;1
davidcom;I have not considered ETFs cause I don't know much about  them. Will read more about that option.;1526222230;dywrvvk;t3_8iwjgc;3
davidcom;So using a commission free ETF or buying mutual founds would probably be a good way of moving forward with my continued investment plan.   Will also try to add more than $100 though it will take more discipline to bring that up to 30% per pay check. Will work on that too;1526222701;dywsb16;t3_8iwjgc;1
davidcom;That's a good suggestion. I need to be more disciplined in order to bring my savings to that amount cause 401k contributions are definitively not sufficient. Will work harder towards that. ;1526222817;dywsesm;t3_8iwjgc;1
Alex123432;I believe the rule is actaully 20 percent a month towards investments and 10 to 20 percent towards an emergency fund. Then once you have a 3 to 6 month funded emergency fun start putting 30 to 35 percent into investments. It's not my rule either thats just what I was taught and stand by, I forget who teaches that.;1526226227;dywvlbh;t3_8iwjgc;2

MagicNate;I would recommend investing in DRIPS (Dividend Reinvestment Plan) basically you will get a dividend but instead of them just giving you the money they'll take the money and reinvest it as money times as you can slowly but surely you'll start to develop a lot of stocks of the company so the dividends will start to add up. On top of this the stock is often sold to you at lower than market price and since you're going directly through the company you won't have to pay any banking fees!!;1527176830;dzia911;t3_8iwjgc;2

MagicNate;Also think of ETFs as investing in a sector not a company, this is good because they're very stable they don't go anywhere fast but tend to move up with the market. For example if you invested in a single company that company's stock could go down in price... If you invested in an etf that had competing company's for example apple and Android then one of the company's would go down and because of that the other would go up often times netting 0% net increase or decrease;1527115542;dzgywv1;t3_8knyb1;1

MuscovianFed;"I'd play carefully with Zoe. I don't watch it too closely but its same store sales comp was negative when the street was looking for .05% growth. They also missed earnings, lowered guidance and growth estimates [11% guided v ~15% estimated]. It seems the stock got decently fairly cut; I'd at least hedge the options call w/ a put to prevent potential loss. Even if the stores story is positive in the long term &amp; their growth plans pan out positively in the next 8-15months, the market may not carry it unless there's some positive headline. Otherwise, those large short positions may help push the stock lower w/ negative momentum.

DStrader888;Hi Davin. My advice is go for companies that have a benefit for the future and not companies that going to get run over by advancing technology or political issues. I have a broker that recommends good companies on the particular sectors I like and I choose out of the options he gives me or take a few of them depending on my cash flow at the time. He works commission only so he's not going to recommend something that he doesn't believe that is going to do well, as he makes money on the profit he makes you. Don't mind pointing you in the right direction if you get stuck or still unsure.  All the best;1538515690;e71xliz;t3_97f5so;1

So they don't just charge you a fee on the buy and exit and don't care what you invest in. They have been with me from the beginning to the end on all of my investments bought and sold. If your still doubtful about Trading 212, I don't mind pointing you in the right direction.;1538514916;e71woqa;t3_9dmx4j;2
DTMMF;Yes if you could point me in the right direction it would be really appreciated!  Trading 212 are regulated, however I’ve seen some concerning  reviews which has made me want to look elsewhere. Which online broker would you personally suggest? Thanks! ;1538570006;e7340tv;t3_9dmx4j;1

RedditCaldwell;"Just a few things: 

All are good and have their own strengths such as connections, investments, and science. 

My favorite, personally, is CRON for the science and connections. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to point out to everyone that this whole ""Canadian ban"" for everyone who smokes, sells, or invests in pot stocks is nothing but FUD and will not happen. That's illegal and it came out from shorts who are wanting to buy lower. Buy the pot dip. This is ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's all. You can't go wrong in investing in any of the 3 above. Also, Tilray ($TLRY) is good. ";1536927521;e5ym21r;t3_9fr6u6;3
Neznau;"Thanks for the opinion. 

Regarding TLRY, I remember reading someone’s comment, which said the recent run is mostly due to the stock’s inclusion in weed ETFs in contrast to some of the three companies above, and once investors put a bit more energy into picking instruments, a decline is likely. What do you think about that?";1536928438;e5ymsvh;t3_9fr6u6;1
TheBelowIsFalse;"I like CGC, ACBFF, and CRON. Each is becoming well-established globally, and all have first mover’s advantage. None of them are “safe”, but since the $5B Constellation investment, CGC seems to be the safest place to put your dollar.

I believe ACBFF is the one that people “sleep on” the most, but may provide the most significant gains in coming months/years. They’re priced reasonably right now ($6.08/share), financials are decent *compared to some of the others*, and they have the largest market cap/capacity next to CGC.";1536931377;e5ypguv;t3_9fr6u6;1
RedditCaldwell;"I'm not 100% sure on the ETF thing; I have no read anything about that anywhere-- and I look daily! I know the most recent run is particularly because they have an agreement to ship to Germany for medical use, which is huge seeing as that Germany is the 2nd largest country for marijuana use, right now. TLRY and CRON are the two favorites to land a partnership with Diageo. Rumors are that whichever doesn't get that deal will get a deal with $BUD, but we'll see. 

As far as a major decline, what most people don't know is that insider share-holders have their shares locked until Jan 15, 2019 as a part of their deal. With Canada going legal on October 17, 2018, sales are expected to do extremely well and TLRY will grow massively. So if there is any major, steep decline of over 25%, I don't see it happening until next year, if at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then again, if I could time the market right all the time, I'd be a billionaire lol. ";1536935442;e5ytpjd;t3_9fr6u6;3

DStrader888;I've invested in both and have invested in some other great similar companies that have strong contracts for the next 3-5 years. Have been shown some great profits already. My broker keeps me fully up to date with all market news and speculation surrounding all my investments. He let's me know when the best time to buy but more importantly I think, he tells me when to sell aswell.

kinnaq;"Too stupid; didn't read:  BCC was a ponzi, but people were too stupid to see the signs.  Somehow having more 'analysts' will solve the problem, and of course they plug their own informational services.  

Yes, I have some money in crypto -- for the same reason I play poker.  But what are analysts going to do?  Do I need an analyst to point out that a ponzi scheme with all of the telltale signs of a ponzi scheme is a ponzi scheme?  I tried to do so every time BCC popped up on reddit, but stupid greedy people gonna be stupid and greedy.  Furthermore, what analysis?  What fundamentals are we examining?  Is there a book value?  A P/E ratio?  

This is just ridiculous.  Here are the rules of the game:

1. There are no fundamentals.  There is no inherent value.  You can't make a value play.  It's a gamble, and you need to treat it like a gamble, knowing that the odds of loss are huge.

2. There is no such thing as a guaranteed return on crypto.  Especially when that guarantee is a huge percentage with a time lock.  How much more obvious can a ponzi be?

3. This article, and articles like this, are clickbait and selling their own service to 'analyze your investment'.  To reiterate, if you think crypto is an investment, you are already making a mistake.  If you apply common sense gambling rules to crypto, you are on the right track, and you should then be very wary of 'analysts'.

BRK_B;"Asking about which stocks to play for 5G is a lot like asking about which stocks for other disruptive technologies like cloud computing, AI, quantum computing, etc. There will always be big players in the market. For tech companies, this is Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Apple, Google, etc. For companies in telecommunications, which is what you are asking about, there are 4 main players - T Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, AT&amp;T. Don't try to play 5G disruption by buying the little 5G companies, because they don't have enough money to do the necessary R&amp;D. Only the big players have that kind of capital. And the big players are too big of companies for an advancement like 5G to have a significant impact on stock price. The telecommunications sector is extremely competitive as of late, and it doesn't look to be getting easier moving forward. 

The only way I can see you investing for a high rate of return on 5G technology is to speculate in who will reach it first or who will be the supplier for the equipment. This is a very risky bet. Just keep that in mind as you move forward. 

There are better technologies for investing in (my personal opinion). Cloud computing, for example, is a very high margin business and major corporations are rapidly moving to take advantage of software as a service, infrastructure as a service, etc. Long story short, invest in something where you can predict who will win with reasonable confidence.
