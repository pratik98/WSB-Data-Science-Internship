*WSB language characteristics* (e.g. kind of words used, emojis used) 
  * How can WSB's language be described?
    - Utilize different language analysis techniques (word/emoji counts, choice of words, n-grams/phrases, topic modeling, sentiment, etc.)
    - What makes WSB's language characteristic and different from other text sources? (e.g. Wikipedia, other subreddits) / Compare to reference text/language? (some other text corpus e.g. some authors, computer linguistics)
    - Put it on temporal scale / Time Period -2018- 2021 - how have the features changes/evolved over time?
    - Analyse contrasts between corpora (how do most important words differ? e.g. with placement of words/phrases within embeddings)
    - Utilize state of the art embeddings, e.g. BERT, GPT
    - Analyse how contexts of a word change over time (e.g. temporal word embeddings, HistWords)
    - Find cosine similarity between word vectors of (an emoji and a word, an emoji and an emoji, a word and a word)
    - Can we establish a new methodology for reviewing phrases instead of words with common techniques, etc.?
    - Are there differences in wording (of the title) based on the post flair?

  * Popularity of posts
    - Are there patterns among the most popular posts?
    - Can we predict for a new post how popular it will be?

  * Pre vs post hype comparison 
    - Has the language changed after the hype?
    - If so, which changes are observable? (usage of emojis, choice of words)
    - Are new users using old WSB patterns inflationary?

  * User-based analysis
    - Are there differences between "old" users (pre-2021) and new ones?
    - Are there clusters of users? 
    - Can we identify those that have posted (successful) DDs? 
    - Can we rank the users according to their expertise?
    - Are the same users active in the other reviewed subreddits? 

  * Compare it with 
    - similar analysis from other social media platform e.g. Twitter
    - other investing sub reddits (i.e. r/stocks, r/investing,r/stock_picks, r/stockmarket)

  * Applying Machine/Deep Learning techniques to the reddit comments
    - cluster the emojis and Words used on WSB
    - generate WSB-like comments/posts
    - is it possible to identify sarcastic comments using DL/NLP? quite a lot of comments talking about some stocks going HIGH are sarcasm. Explore sarcams detection literature.
    - Which are frequently used sentiment analysis approaches? Do they work on WSB? Can we utilize GPT-3 for better results?
    - Input texts/submissions into a language model together with an ML question/task and see what the model outputs.
    - Create a labelled dataset based on Tolga's previous analysis => can we solve interesting supervised learning tasks based on the labels?

  * Transfer/compare analysis to/with other context
    - for other stock markets. e.g.india, china etc.

  * Analysis of Comments
    - Expand analysis from Tolga's previous paper to comments (after labelling submissions based on analysis)
